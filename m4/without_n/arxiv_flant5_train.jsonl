These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large number of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single pendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain breathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation of the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing transition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled nonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a given chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D system, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the inter-chain coupling constant.

A secondary receiver observes a multiple access channel of two users, the secondary and the primary transmitter, respectively. We show that, for spectrally-efficient operation, the secondary system should apply Opportunistic Interference Cancellation (OIC). With OIC, the secondary system decodes the primary signal when such an opportunity is created by the primary rate and the power received from the primary system. For such an operation, we derive the achievable data rate in the secondary system. When the primary signal is decodable, we devise a method, based on superposition coding, by which the secondary system can achieve the maximal possible rate. Finally, we investigate the power allocation in the secondary system when multiple channels are used.

For most of these afterglows, the X-ray spectral slope and the decay indices before and after the break can be accommodated by the standard jet model although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out. In addition, there are 27 other afterglows whose X-ray light-curves may also exhibit a late break to a steep decay, but the evidence is not that compelling.   The X-ray emissions of 38 afterglows decay slower than t^{-1.5} until after 3 day, half of them exhibiting such a slow decay until after 10 day.   Therefore, the fraction of well-monitored Swift afterglows with potential jet-breaks is around 60 percent, whether we count only the strongest cases for each type or all of them.

In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5, v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the galaxies star forming lifetime.

We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics.

Reflected shock waves allowed temperatures from 1230 to 1800 K and pressures from 7.3 to 9.5 atm to be obtained.

Detailed mechanisms for the combustion of cyclohexane and cyclopentane have been proposed to reproduce these results. The elementary steps included in the kinetic models of the oxidation of cyclanes are close to those proposed to describe the oxidation of acyclic alkanes and alkenes. Consequently, it has been possible to obtain these models by using an improved version of software EXGAS, a computer package developed to perform the automatic generation of detailed kinetic models for the gas-phase oxidation and combustion of linear and branched alkanes and alkenes.

One of the most attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical processes are related to interactions at the weak scale and therefore may be tested in collider experiments in the near future. This is true for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for its extension with the addition of one singlet chiral superfield, the so-called nMSSM. It has been recently shown that within the nMSSM an elegant solution to both the problem of baryogenesis and dark matter may be found, that relies mostly on the mixing of the singlet sector with the Higgs sector of the theory. In this work we review the nMSSM model constraints from cosmology and present the associated collider phenomenology at the LHC and the ILC. We show that the ILC will efficiently probe the neutralino, chargino and Higgs sectors, allowing to confront cosmological observations with computations based on collider measurements. We also investigate the prospects for a direct detection of dark matter and the constraints imposed by the current bounds of the electron electric dipole moment in this model.

For temperatures above T_nmr ~ 50 K, the model gives a good quantitative description of the data in the metallic phases of several k-(ET)2X materials. These materials display antiferromagnetic correlation lengths which increase with decreasing temperature and grow to several lattice constants by T_nmr. It is shown that the fact that the dimensionless Korringa ratio is much larger than unity is inconsistent with a broad class of theoretical models (such as dynamical mean-field theory) which neglects spatial correlations and/or vertex corrections. For materials close to the Mott insulating phase the nuclear spin relaxation rate, the Knight shift and the Korringa ratio all decrease significantly with decreasing temperature below T_nmr. This cannot be described by the M-MMP model and the most natural explanation is that a pseudogap, similar to that observed in the underdoped cuprate superconductors, opens up in the density of states below T_nmr. Such a pseudogap has recently been predicted to occur in the dimerised organic charge transfer salts materials by the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory. We propose specific new experiments on organic superconductors to elucidate these issues. For example, measurements to see if high magnetic fields or high pressures can be used to close the pseudogap would be extremely valuable.

The algorithm consists of three elements. First, the bounded temporal formula to be verified is translated into a monadic first-order logic over difference inequalities, which we call monadic difference logic. Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference formula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that step. Third, the resulting formula is checked for being a tautology or being unsatisfiable by a decision procedure for monadic difference logic.   We further provide a simple decision procedure for monadic difference logic based on the data structure Difference Decision Diagrams. The algorithm is complete in a very strong sense on a subclass of temporal formulae characterized as homogeneously monadic and it is approximate on other formulae. The approximation comes from the fact that not all unsatisfiable or tautological formulae are recognised at the earliest possible time of the runtime verification.   Contrary to existing approaches, the presented algorithms do not work by syntactic rewriting but employ efficient decision structures which make them applicable in real applications within for instance business software.

{"prompt": "Inside-Out Evacuation of Transitional Protoplanetary Disks by the\n  Magneto-Rotational Instability", "human_text": "  How do T Tauri disks accrete? The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) supplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized to be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain observed accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as transitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim radii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim, activating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited by the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger the surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the accretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the MRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton scatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the rim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas. Contrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the transport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau. Because the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk properties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture provides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior to the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport properties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our study also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk drains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by stellar ultraviolet radiation.

We follow the methodology described in paper I: we adopt an unstratified shearing box model and focus on the case where the net vertical magnetic flux threading the box vanishes. For the most part we use the finite difference code ZEUS, including explicit transport coefficients in the calculations. However, we also compare our results with those obtained using other algorithms (NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate both the convergence of our results and their independence of the numerical scheme. We find that small scale dissipation affects the saturated state of MHD turbulence. In agreement with recent similar numerical simulations done in the presence of a net vertical magnetic flux, we find that turbulent activity (measured by the rate of angular momentum transport) is an increasing function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm for all values of the Reynolds number Re that we investigated. We also found that turbulence disappears when the Prandtl number falls below a critical value Pm_c that is apparently a decreasing function of Re. For the limited region of parameter space that can be probed with current computational resources, we always obtained Pm_c>1. We conclude that the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are important in determining the properties of MHD turbulence in numerical simulations in the shearing box with zero net flux, at least for Reynolds numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers that are such that transport is not dominated by numerical effects and thus can be probed using current computational resources.

We demonstrate that the off-diagonal hopping responsible for transitions between $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals, and the absence of SU(2) invariance in orbital space, have important implications. One finds that superexchange contributes in all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply, and the kinetic energy is much enhanced as compared with the spin case. Therefore, orbital ordered states are harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock approximation (HFA), and the onset of a uniform ferro-orbital polarization and antiferro-orbital instability are similar to each other, unlike in spin case. Next we formulate a cubic (gauge) invariant slave boson approach using the orbitals with complex coefficients. In the mean-field approximation it leads to the renormalization of the kinetic energy, and provides a reliable estimate for the ground state energy of the disordered state. Using this approach one finds that the HFA fails qualitatively in the regime of large Coulomb repulsion $U\\to\\infty$ -- the orbital order is unstable, and instead a strongly correlated orbital liquid with disordered orbitals is realized at any electron filling.

{"prompt": "On the inspiral of Massive Black Holes in gas-rich galaxy mergers", "human_text": "  We present a study on the dynamics of massive BHs in galaxy mergers, obtained from a series of high-resolution N-Body/SPH simulations. The presence of a gaseous component is essential for the rapid formation of an eccentric (Keplerian) BH binary, that resides at the center of a massive (~10^9 Msun) turbulent nuclear disc. Using physically and/or numerically motivated recipes, we follow the accretion history of the BHs during the merger. The mass of the BHs increases as large central inflows of gas occur inside each galaxy, and their mass ratio varies with time. Given the encountered strong degeneracy between numerical resolution and physical assumptions, we suggest here three possible paths followed by the galaxies and the BHs during a merger in order to fulfill the M-sigma relation : Adjustment, Symbiosis, and BH Dominance. In an extremely high resolution run, we resolved the turbulent gas pattern down to parsec scales, and found that BH feedback is expected to be effective near the end of the merger. We then trace the BH binary orbit down to a scale of 0.1 pc modeling the nuclear disc as an equilibrium Mestel disc composed either of gas, gas and stars, or just stars. Under the action of dynamical friction against the rotating gaseous and/or stellar background the orbit circularizes. When this occurs, each BH is endowed with its own small-size (~0.01 pc) accretion disc comprising a few percent of the BH mass.

Our results suggest that the high energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$). For very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.

The primary focus is the study of diffusive motion of small probe particles. Comparison is made with measurements of solution viscosities.

One finds that alpha depends on polymer molecular weights as alpha ~ M^0.8, and \\nu appears to have large-M and small-M values with a crossover linking them. The probe diffusion coefficient does not simply track the solution viscosity; instead, D_p eta typically increases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight. In some systems, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose:water, the observed probe spectra are bi- or tri-modal. Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies that hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single, concentration-independent, length scale that is approximately the size of a polymer coil. In a very few systems, one sees re-entrant or low-concentration-plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation; from their rarity, these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to specific chemical effects.

The moving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an excess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in the appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the vortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective direction-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$ reaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex motion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such lines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length $\\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function.

Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution when tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse limit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped spin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering and a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a generic Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the system in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples asymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers a natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current. We show, in particular, that one can devise pumping cycles along which the average spin pumped per cycle is closely equal to $\\hbar$. By analogy with Brouwer's formula for noninteracting systems with two driven parameters, the pumped spin current is expressed as a geometrical property of a scattering matrix. However, the relevant %Alex: I replaced topological with geometrical in the sentence above scattering matrix that enters the formulation pertains to the Majorana fermions that appear at the Toulouse limit rather than the physical electrons that carry the current.

In a low-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a semiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a chain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain stiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible chain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the condensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is locally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form such as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the nature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete manner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain. This discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a semiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the collapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and salt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are summarized in a schematic state diagram.

Observations began with the XRT and UVOT telescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s.

We therefore considered two-component jet models and find that the X-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by a model in which both components are energy injected for the duration of the observed afterglow and the X-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the narrow component.

In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two orders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the conventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures below Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3% in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.

By comparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism that could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the trilayers.

We mapped the distribution of elemental abundance ratios across the cluster and detected a strong chemical discontinuity using the abundance ratio of silicon to iron, equivalent to a variation from 100% SN Ia iron mass fraction in the West-Northwest regions to 32% in the Eastern region. The \"center\" of the cluster is located at the chemical discontinuity boundary, which is inconsistent with the radially symmetric chemical gradient found in some regular clusters, but consistent with a cluster merging scenario. We predict that the velocity gradient as measured will produce a variation of the CMB temperature towards the East of the core of the cluster that will be detectable by current and near-future bolometers.

Applications to real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed. Traditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to their asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms tends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic mean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general 2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and lower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change of this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these expressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change. Using these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with respect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the existence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case of a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a strictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small values of the mean time between false alarms.

Once the bubble thickness is resolved, the equations of motion do not allow O(4) symmetric solutions joining the two branches. We conclude that the thin wall instanton is unphysical, and that one cannot have processes connecting the two branches, unless negative tension bubble walls are introduced.

If these objects are responsible for the bulk of galactic cosmic rays, then they should accelerate protons and nuclei to 10^15 eV and beyond, i.e. act as cosmic PeVatrons. The model of diffusive shock acceleration allows, under certain conditions, acceleration of particles to such high energies and their gradual injection into the interstellar medium, mainly during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. The most energetic particles are released first, while particles of lower energies are more effectively confined in the shell, and are released at later epochs. Thus the spectrum of nonthermal paticles inside the shell extends to PeV energies only during a relatively short period of the evolution of the remnant.

Yet, despite almost a quarter century of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In particular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that attractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally during working memory tasks?

Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field analysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network scales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been suggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones.

The source was detected at the edge of the XIS image during a routine observation of the calibration source 1E 0102.2-7219, a supernova remnant in the SMC. We constrained the source position using ray-tracing simulations. No such transient source was found at the position in the other Suzaku observations nor in all the available archived images of other X-ray missions for the last ~28 years. The XIS spectrum can be explained by a single blackbody with a temperature of ~72 eV, and an interstellar extinction of ~4.9x10^{20} H atoms cm^{-2} consistent with the value to the SMC. An additional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably due to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions. Assuming that the source is at the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is ~10^{37} erg s^{-1} and the radius of the source is ~10^{8} cm. The XIS light curve shows about a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks observation. Together with the archived data, the X-ray flux in the burst is at least three orders of magnitude brighter than the undetected quiescent level.

The observation supports the existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the shock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer filament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of the shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the spatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s, and its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front.

{"prompt": "Accreting Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Systems", "human_text": "  Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE), astronomers have discovered that disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three distinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations. These oscillations are powered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong gravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that has accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the oscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational field of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can therefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important astrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond pulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields required to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases, but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars show that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the magnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of angular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show whether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the kilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is predicted by strong-field general relativity. It has also greatly narrowed the possible descriptions of ultradense matter. ", "machine_text": "The accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems are a new class of X-ray source.

For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.

We adopt the local shearing box model and focus on the special case for which the initial magnetic flux threading the disk vanishes. We employ the finite difference code ZEUS to evolve the ideal MHD equations. Performing a set of numerical simulations in a fixed computational domain with increasing resolution, we demonstrate that turbulent activity decreases as resolution increases. We quantify the turbulent activity by measuring the rate of angular momentum transport through evaluating the standard alpha parameter. We find alpha=0.004 when (N_x,N_y,N_z)=(64,100,64), alpha=0.002 when (N_x,N_y,N_z)=(128,200,128) and alpha=0.001 when (N_x,N_y,N_z)=(256,400,256). This steady decline is an indication that numerical dissipation, occurring at the grid scale is an important determinant of the saturated form of the MHD turbulence. Analysing the results in Fourier space, we demonstrate that this is due to the MRI forcing significant flow energy all the way down to the grid dissipation scale. We also use our results to study the properties of the numerical dissipation in ZEUS. Its amplitude is characterised by the magnitude of an effective magnetic Reynolds number Re_M which increases from 10^4 to 10^5 as the number of grid points is increased from 64 to 256 per scale height. The simulations we have carried out do not produce results that are independent of the numerical dissipation scale, even at the highest resolution studied.

The phase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a certain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect of the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion of the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions. One of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical liquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical voids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a vapor-liquid transition line at a triple point.

The 3-body star-binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the point where energy losses from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) lead to rapid coalescence. We model this process based on observed and simulated MP distributions and take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary MBH interaction due to acceleration in the galactic potential. We show that mergers of gas-rich galactic nuclei lead to binary MBH coalescence well within the Hubble time. Moreover, lower-mass binary MBHs (<10^8 Msun) require only a few percent of the typical gas mass in a post-merger nucleus to coalesce in a Hubble time. The fate of a binary MBH in a gas poor galactic merger is less certain, although massive stellar structures (e.g. clusters, stellar rings) could likewise lead to efficient coalescence.

It is suggested that deviations of the frequency exponent \\gamma from unity, observed in thin metal films, can be attributed to quantum backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating field of the charge carrier. This backreaction is described phenomenologically in terms of the effective momentum space dimensionality, D. Using the dimensional continuation technique, it is shown that the combined action of the photon heat bath and external field results in a 1/f^gamma-contribution to the spectral density of the two-point correlation function of electromagnetic field. The frequency exponent is found to be equal to 1 + delta, where delta = 3 - D is a reduction of the momentum space dimensionality.

It has been established that this DPT falls in the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero, period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent, \\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for the critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that, for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b.

The \"bluer-when-brighter\" mild chromatism of the long-term variations of the source can be explained if the flux increases/decreases faster in the B than in the R band. The B and R-band variations are well correlated, with no significant, measurable delays larger than a few days.

The field is produced by a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are investigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced magnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid sodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the time-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell, but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic flow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is controlled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the observed velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in the linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared with the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model provides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies in a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating regime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite to the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the laboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a strong meridional flow.

High-velocity flows are enclosed by low-velocity flows after protostar formation. The difference in the degree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the strength of the magnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass configuration; therefore, flows from the adiabatic core are driven mainly by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field lines. In contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a straight configuration owing to Ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas region. Therefore, flows from the protostar are driven mainly by the magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines. Differing depth of the gravitational potential between the adiabatic core and the protostar cause the difference of the flow speed.

This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone, in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm.

The concept of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew distributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations susceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general control strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.

Nowadays, one of the key challenges is to integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database systems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiency provided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach for decision trees within a classical database system. In other words, we try to discover knowledge from relational databases, in the form of production rules, via a procedure embedding SQL queries. The obtained decision tree is defined by successive, related relational views. Each view corresponds to a given population in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical Induction Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree.

We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by m times the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. In particular, we analyze the optimal long-term solution, showing that zero outage can be achieved provided that the corresponding short-term SNR exponent with the same system parameters is strictly greater than one. Conversely, if the short-term SNR exponent is smaller than one, we show that zero outage cannot be achieved. In this case, we derive the corresponding long-term SNR exponent as a function of the Singleton bound. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation.

We explore the question of whether this information can be used twice -- once in weak lensing and then again in halo clustering to calibrate cluster masses -- or whether the combined dark energy constraints are weaker than the sum of the individual constraints. For a survey like the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we find that the cosmic shearing of source galaxies at high redshifts is indeed highly correlated with halo clustering at lower redshifts. Surprisingly, this correlation does not degrade cosmological constraints for a DES-like survey, and in fact, constraints are marginally improved since the correlations themselves act as additional observables. This considerably simplifies the analysis for a DES-like survey: when weak lensing and halo clustering are treated as independent experiments, the combined dark energy constraints (cluster counts included) are accurate if not slightly conservative.

In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.

This is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which entanglement breaking occurs.

As an example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\\to d pi, derived in ChPT.

{"prompt": "The First Stellar Cluster", "human_text": "  We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early universe that focus on gas at very high densities and very low metallicities. We argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will fragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum. Rotation leads to the build-up of massive disk-like structures which fragment to form protostars. At metallicities Z ~ 10^-5 Zsun, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a sudden drop of temperature at densities above n = 10^12 cm^-3. This induces vigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass stars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks below 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and comparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently discovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial gas can fragment at densities 10^14 cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, although the resulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of ten less than the Z = 10^-5 Zsun mass function), and is biased towards higher masses. A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic exponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to angular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is less efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses in excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from previous studies.

Multiple regimes that characterize qualitatively different physics due to the differential prevalence of rebinding effects are predicted.

We investigate the dynamics of the flow for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to 20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both, increasing elasticity and inertia.

Charge density modes are irrelevelant since the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a large plasmon gap and their incompressibility. In solidarity with these doubts, recent measurements of the Mott critical point in low dimensional organic materials yield critical exponents in violent diasagreement with the bosonic mode criticality lore.

Therefore, they can be used, at least in principle, to put constraints on that interaction. Similar phenomena are expected to be observed in solar-like stars and can be modelled to shed light on analogous interactions in different environments. The source of the torsional oscillations is investigated by means of a model for the angular momentum transport within the convection zone. A description of the torsional oscillations is introduced, based on an analytical solution of the angular momentum equation in the mean-field approach. It provides information on the intensity and location of the torques producing the redistribution of the angular momentum within the convection zone of the Sun along the activity cycle. The method can be extended to solar-like stars for which some information on the time-dependence of the differential rotation is becoming available. Illustrative applications to the Sun and solar-like stars are presented. Under the hypothesis that the solar torsional oscillations are due to the mean-field Lorentz force, the mean amplitude of the Maxwell stresses and the phase relationship between poloidal and toroidal field components are obtained.

We derive the 3-D HI volume density distribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and a height of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. Methods. We used the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation from brightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We explored several models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of these models was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a self-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results. Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find a self-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a dark matter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun.

Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

In the framework of so-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between appearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than $3\\sigma$, and hence no satistfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes. This tension remains also when a third sterile neutrino is added, and the quality of the global fit does not improve significantly in a (3+3) scheme. It should be noted, however, that in models with more than one sterile neutrino the MiniBooNE results are in perfect agreement with the LSND appearance evidence, thanks to the possibility of CP violation available in such oscillation schemes.

It is found that this product represents the actual mass flux at 6 solar radii for the fast wind, but not for the slow wind. In regions dominated by the slow wind, the fluxes derived from SWAN are systematically smaller. This is interpreted as a proof that the fast solar wind has reached its terminal velocity at about 6 solar radii and expands with constant velocity beyond this distance. On the contrary, the slow solar wind has reached only half of its terminal value and is thus accelerated further out.

In neurophysiology, time series of electric neuronal activity are essential for studying brain interconnectivity. Such signals can either be invasively measured from depth electrodes, or computed from very high time resolution, non-invasive, extracranial recordings of scalp electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and magnetic fields (MEG: magnetoencephalogram) by means of a tomography such as sLORETA (standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). There are two problems in this case. First, in the usual situation of unknown cortical geometry, the estimated signal at each brain location is a vector with three components (i.e. a current density vector), which means that coherence and phase synchronization must be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series. Second, the inherent low spatial resolution of the EEG/MEG tomography introduces artificially high zero-lag coherence and phase synchronization. In this report, solutions to both problems are presented. Two additional generalizations are briefly mentioned: (1) conditional coherence and phase synchronization; and (2) non-stationary time-frequency analysis. Finally, a non-parametric randomization method for connectivity significance testing is outlined.

These properties are important because they are the basis of most of the reasoning methods used to solve classical (existentially quantified) constraints, and one would like to benefit from similar reasoning methods in the resolution of quantified constraints. In this paper, we show that most of the properties that are used by solvers for CSP can be generalized to quantified CSP.

This outburst is characterised by strong irradiation of the front face of the secondary star by the white dwarf, an overflowing stream which is seen strongly in HeII and by a dip in the light curves, which extends from 0.1-0.6 in the binary and spin phases. Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of the inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the suppression of the Hg and Hb emission.   Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the overflow stream material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km/s. In outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities (~1500 km/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the white dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near the outer edge of the disc and corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this material and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary phase 0.4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse minimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion curtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the outer edge of the disc.

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN.

These morphological classifications are compared to local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties.

Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this direction we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing diversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect to the field.

Of particular importance is the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo assembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in that region, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular cluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases for the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars forming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby the progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own stars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale radiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies derived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean reionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionization for Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in clusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the underlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the halo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and predominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun (corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being reionized preferentially from distant sources.

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell and are associated with translational and rotational freedom.

This article focuses solely on an extreme gamma-ray outburst detected in the early hours of July 28, 2006 (MJD 53944). The average flux observed during this outburst is I(>200 GeV) = (1.72$\\pm$$0.05_{\\rm stat}$$\\pm$$0.34_{\\rm syst}$) $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to ~7 times the flux, I(>200 GeV), observed from the Crab Nebula. Peak fluxes are measured with one-minute time scale resolution at more than twice this average value. Variability is seen up to ~600 s in the Fourier power spectrum, and well-resolved bursts varying on time scales of ~200 seconds are observed. There are no strong indications for spectral variability within the data.

We perform a series of numerical experiments where we grow a baryonic core inside a live dark matter halo extracted from a cosmological simulation. We follow the orbits of more than 300 particles with more that 50000 timesteps. Our results clearly show that the dissipational component is responsible for repeatedly deflecting orbits which visit often the center of the system. Moreover the gravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of the baryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremely chaotic. This randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. When this effect takes place for a significant number of orbits it will be manifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounder configuration. As a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shape of the phase space decreases with increasing distance from the center.

This produces a formula for investigating the standard quantum limit which is central to addressing many theoretical issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena and experimental concerns related to low temperature precision measurements. We find that any initial state always settles down to a Gaussian density matrix whose covariance is determined by the thermal reservoir and whose mean is determined by the external force. For more general spectra we show that the solution of the master equation can be reduced to solving for the motion of a classical parametric oscillator with parametric frequency determined by the unsolved for master equation coefficients.

These correlations are responsible for the ``collisional'' evolution of the system beyond the Vlasov regime due to finite $N$ effects.

This enlightens the basic physics and provides novel kinetic equations with a clear physical interpretation. However, unless we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous systems, closed kinetic equations can be obtained only if we ignore some collective effects between particles. General exact coupled equations taking into account collective effects are also given.

Because AGN luminosity is likely to depend on Mbh, selection effects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentially producing a false signal of evolution. This bias arises because cosmic scatter in the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relations means that the mean log(L) or log(sigma) among galaxies that host a black hole of given Mbh, may be substantially different than the log(L) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the Mbh-L or Mbh-sigma relations for the same nominal Mbh. The bias is particularly strong at high Mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies are falling rapidly. The most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliers in galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, which would otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence of cosmic scatter. Because of this bias, Mbh will typically appear to be too large in the distant sample for a given L or sigma.

The equivalent-multishell approach yields the polarizability scalar and the antenna efficiency of a bundle of finite-length CNTs in the long-wavelength regime over a wide frequency range spanning the terahertz and the near-infrared regimes. Edge effects give rise to geometric resonances in such bundles.   The antenna efficiency of a CNT bundle at the first resonance can exceed that of a single CNT by four orders of magnitude, which is promising for the design and development of CNT-bundle antennas and composite materials containing CNT-bundles as inclusions.

Further, in that mapping the gauge field plays the role of the linear connection of the curved space-time and an effective metric tensor arises naturally from the mapping. The obtained action, being quadratic in the Riemann-Christoffel tensor, at a first sight, spoils a gravity interpretation of the model. Thus, we provide a sketch of a mechanism that breaks the $SO(d)$ color invariance and generates the Einstein-Hilbert term, as well as a cosmological constant term, allowing an interpretation of the model as a modified gravity in the Palatini formalism. In that sense, gravity can be visualized as an effective classical theory, originated from a well defined quantum gauge theory.

The main results are the following. 1) The cirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously overestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where <I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in accordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a given angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing amplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust emission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average but shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have systematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and kurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong non-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power spectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function of wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification of Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.

The spots range in latitude from 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar value but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well constrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini.

The analytic expressions for all related physical quantities at high temperature are also provided. The obtained analytic results are compared with numerical computations and good agreement is found. We demonstrate for the first time that the Lifshitz theory, when applied to the configuration of metal-dielectric, satisfies the requirements of thermodynamics if the static dielectric permittivity of a dielectric plate is finite. If it is infinitely large, the Lifshitz formula is shown to violate the Nernst heat theorem.

The armchair edge GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different geometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse direction. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and strongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is approximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent experiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel effects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms of the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more useful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator. Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the channel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass facilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not promise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic switching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of Si MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high speed electronics applications, where the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.

Here we adopt a three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical numerical scheme to simulate atmospheric circulation on close-in gas giant planets. In contrast to the conventional GCM and shallow water algorithms, this method does not assume quasi hydrostatic equilibrium and it approximates radiation transfer from optically thin to thick regions with flux-limited diffusion. In the first paper of this series, we consider synchronously-spinning gas giants. We show that a full three-dimensional treatment, coupled with rotationally modified flows and an accurate treatment of radiation, yields a clear temperature transition at the terminator. Based on a series of numerical simulations with varying opacities, we show that the night-side temperature is a strong indicator of the opacity of the planetary atmosphere. Planetary atmospheres that maintain large, interstellar opacities will exhibit large day-night temperature differences, while planets with reduced atmospheric opacities due to extensive grain growth and sedimentation will exhibit much more uniform temperatures throughout their photosphere's.

The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement with the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low separation could be overcome with small radius sphere.

In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This relaxation is not always tight.

Using the laser and natural guide star AO systems on the Keck II telescope, we imaged Sgr A* in multiple near-infrared broadband filters with a typical cycle time of ~3 min during 4 observing runs (2005-2006), two of which were simultaneous with Chandra X-ray measurements. In spite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for Sgr A* (2-30 mJy), all of our near-IR measurements are consistent with a constant spectral index of alpha = -0.6+-0.2. Furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectral indices observed at X-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which is consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton model for the production of the X-ray emission. During the coordinated observations, one IR outburst occurs <36 min after a possibly associated X-ray outburst, while several similar IR outbursts show no elevated X-ray emission. A variable X-ray to IR ratio and constant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the IR and X-ray emission are connected to the same electrons. We, therefore, posit that the population of electrons responsible for both the IR and X-ray emission are generated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electron energy distribution responsible for the IR emission unchanged, but has a variable high-energy cutoff. Occasionally a tail of electrons >1 GeV is generated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the X-ray outbursts.

The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15 r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system.

In order to constrain the origin of the IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of starless condensations and protostars previously detected by us in the dust continuum at 1.2mm in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. The starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in the protocluster. We carried out detailed molecular line observations, including some N2H+(1-0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster condensations using the IRAM 30m telescope. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels of internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which generally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm dust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless condensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We measured a global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km/s between condensations. This small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in general, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another before evolving into pre-main sequence objects. Our observations support the view that the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage. Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the protostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern the growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced by gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.

We investigate this problem in a model-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy' phase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of acceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective cosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with a characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of models from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift (z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy makes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift. Such models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible, therefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes observable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.

An overview of the method is presented before discussing the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of circumstellar discs around young stars. We find that the presence of magnetic fields during the disc formation process can lead to significantly smaller and less massive discs which are much less prone to gravitational instability. Similarly in the case of binary star formation we find that magnetic fields, overall, suppress fragmentation. However these effects are found to be largely driven by magnetic pressure.

In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

In light of this, we present a study of equal-mass, spinning binary-black-hole evolutions through matched filtering techniques commonly used in data analysis. We study how the match between two numerical waveforms varies with numerical resolution, initial angular momentum of the black holes and the inclination angle between the source and the detector. This study is limited by the fact that the spinning black-hole-binaries are oriented axially and the waveforms only contain approximately two and a half orbits before merger.

Motivated by recent measurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath channels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of freedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension (product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the number of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a training and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal short-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates sparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact of multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the wideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality conditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in spectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the importance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results, our results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The coherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby significantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2) Sparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large bandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements for first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling duration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is eliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.

When $h_{ac}$ is parallel to $H_{dc}$ we observe that each vortex penetration event produces a significant supression of the ac losses because the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility as a function of $H_{dc}$ increases before the penetration of vortices, and then it decreases abruptly after vortices have entered into the sample. In the second case, when $h_{ac}$ is perpendicular to $H_{dc}$, we observe that the jumps in dissipation occur at the same values of $H_{dc}$ but are much smaller than in the parallel configuration.

In 13 cases, the linewings could be due to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources also have near-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature. The total fraction of protostars in our sample is 65%. All but four outflow detections are confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer IR detections and only one Spitzer source has no outflow, showing that outflow maps at this sensitivity are equally good at identifying protostars as Spitzer.

We used the amplitude of the 4000 Balmer break (Dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the EW[OII]3727 line as proxy for the star formation activity. We discuss to what extent stellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplay between stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8Gyr. Low-mass galaxies have small Dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution moves to higher Dn4000 values as observed in the local Universe. As cosmic time goes by, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically ET systems at the expense of the LT systems. This spectral transformation is a process started at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe. This is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function. The underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution, likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation activity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked in the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation taking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming stars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes progressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. The concepts of star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a single scenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern.

Using the quasiclassical Green's function formalism, we demonstrate that, quite generally, the pair amplitude in the junction has an admixture of an odd-frequency component due to the breakdown of translational invariance near the N/S interface where the pair potential acquires spatial dependence. If a superconductor has even-parity pair potential (spin-singlet s-wave state), the odd-frequency pairing component with odd-parity is induced near the N/S interface, while in the case of odd-parity pair potential (spin-triplet $p_{x}$-wave or spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave) the odd-frequency component with even-parity is generated. We show that in conventional s-wave junctions, the amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing state is enhanced at energies corresponding to the peaks in the local density of states (LDOS). In $p_x$- and $d_{xy}$-wave junctions, the amplitude of the odd-frequency component on the S side of the N/S interface is enhanced at zero energy where the midgap Andreev resonant state (MARS) appears due to the sign change of the pair potential.

Here we present the complete calculation providing precise details, in particular, of the regularization procedure, which is decisive for the correct derivation of physically meaningful quantities. A basic difference when comparing with the results previously obtained by other authors is the fact that the motion force derived in our approach contains a reactive term --proportional to the mirrors' acceleration. This is of the essence in order to obtain particles with a positive energy all the time during the oscillation of the mirrors --while always satisfying the energy conservation law. A careful analysis of the interrelations among the different results previously obtained in the literature is then carried out. For simplicity, the specific case of a neutral scalar field in one dimension, with one or two partially transmitting mirrors (a fundamental proviso for the regularization issue) is considered in more detail, but our general method is shown to be generalizable, without essential problems (Sect. 2 of this paper), to fields of any kind in two and higher dimensions.

Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of LGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest that these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive stars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple models we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find that the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of main-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known compact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the necessary rotation rates for GRB creation.

The torque produced by a flow of velocity ~100 km/s and baryon density ~10^{-25} kg/m^3, which is within the possible values for the intergalactic medium, is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism offers quite a plausible explanation.

Archival INTEGRAL data and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days.

Fixed xi in such a spacetime represents uniform acceleration. We calculate the force on systems consisting of one or two such plates at fixed values of xi. In the limit of large Rindler coordinate xi (small acceleration), we recover (via the equivalence principle) the situation of weak gravity, and find that the gravitational force on the system is just Mg, where g is the gravitational acceleration and M is the total mass of the system, consisting of the mass of the plates renormalized by the Casimir energy of each plate separately, plus the energy of the Casimir interaction between the plates.

Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to such a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to AP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable properties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique torsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two $d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the symmetric $d$-connections.

Electroweak-, flavour- and Higgs interactions are unified in one single gauge group SU(7) which is broken again down to $G_{SM}^{ex}$ by orbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions. The compactification scale is O(1) TeV. The orbifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ is put on a lattice. This setting gives a staring point for RG-transformations. As a result the bulk is integrated out and the extra dimension consist of only two points: the orbifold fixed points. Parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become nonunitary as a result of the blockspin transformations. In addition, a Higgs potential emerges naturally. The PTs can be written as a product $e^{A_{y}} e^{\\eta} e^{A_{y}}$ of unitary factors $e^{A_{y}}$ and a selfadjoint factor $e^{\\eta}$. The reduction $48 \\to 35 + 6 + \\bar{6} + 1$ of the adjoint reps of SU(7) with respect to $SU(6) \\supset G_{SM}^{ex}$ leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$ Higgs doublets: one for each flavour.

We first show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the relaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero. A key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the typical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the scaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and Andreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that Martian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the past under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated from thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic photographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size of 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at millimetre scale.

Two-Time Physics has shown that the Standard Model of Particles and Forces is successfully reproduced by a two-time field theory in 4 space and 2 time dimensions projected as a holographic image on an emergent spacetime in 3+1 dimensions. Among the successes of this approach is the resolution of the strong CP problem of QCD as an outcome of the restrictions imposed by the higher symmetry structures in 4+2 dimensions. In this paper we launch a program to construct the duals of the Standard Model as other holographic images of the same 4+2 dimensional theory on a variety of emergent spacetimes in 3+1 dimensions. These dual field theories are obtained as a family of gauge choices in the master 4+2 field theory. In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices which lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar with a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes in (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices (including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also outlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously unexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena predicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and experiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most instances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place.

Fully-parallel manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4] and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of the \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces.

From an observational point of view this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code, NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.

The rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different environments.

As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones.

The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power among the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when power is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends only on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is allocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex constraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem. In the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.

In the case of high-velocity cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible that dust grains play a role in producing the emission.

The initial distributions of PSCs at various distances from the MC center are those of gravitationally unstable cores resulting from the gravo-turbulent fragmentation of the MC. As time evolves, there is a competition between the PSCs rates of coalescence and collapse. Whenever the local rate of collapse is larger than the rate of coalescence in a given mass bin, cores are collapsed into stars.

We then investigate the case of ES by a long duration central engine, or delayed external shock (DES), a model that can account for some of the flares observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We present model predictions, in particular in terms of GeV vs X-ray behavior, and compare them with other models proposed to explain the origin of flares. We find that if most of the emission occurs when the fireball is in the fast cooling regime, then a substantial GeV emission is expected both for a short (standard ES) and a long (DES) duration central engine activity. In particular, in the context of standard ES we are able to account for the delayed emission observed in GRB940217. In the case of DES, we find that IC scattering of X-ray flare photons can produce high energy flares in the GeV band, which can be detected by GLAST. The detectability of high energy flares improves with the burst kinetic energy: about 30% of Swift GRBs showing flares in their X-ray light curve have sufficiently large kinetic energy so that the expected high flares can be detected by GLAST. One important prediction of the DES model is the simultaneity between low and high energy flares. To test this simultaneity, the peak energies of both flares need to fall below or within the observational bands.

This work is thus complementary to our previous work (Miller Bertolami & Althaus 2006) and intends to shed some light on the uncertainty behind the evolutionary tracks presented there. We compute full evolutionary models for PG1159 stars taking into account different extramixing (overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the TP-AGB during the progenitor evolution.

Contrary to our expectations, we found that previous evolution is not a main factor in shaping H--deficient post--AGB tracks. Interestingly enough, we find that only an increase of $\\sim50%$ in the intershell opacities at high effective temperatures may affect the tracks as to reconcile spectroscopic and asteroseismologic mass determinations. This forces us to conclude that our previous tracks (Miller Bertolami & Althaus 2006) are robust enough as to be used for spectroscopic mass determinations, unless opacities in the intershell region are substantially different.

We compared model predictions and observations for broad- band colours and for high resolution spectral features. Concerning the broad-band colours, we measured the stellar colour given by three recent sets of model atmospheres and flux distributions(Castelli & Kurucz 2003; Gustafsson et al. 2003; Brott & Hauschildt 2005), and compared them with a recent UBVRIJHK calibration (Worthey & Lee 2007). We found that the models can reproduce with reasonable accuracy the stellar colours for a fair interval in effective temperatures and gravities. The exceptions are: 1) the U-B colour, where the models are typically redder than the observations, and; 2) the very cool stars in general (V-K > ~3).Concerning the high resolution features, we measured 35 spectral indices defined in the literature on three high resolution synthetic libraries (Coelho et al. 2005; Martins et al. 2005; Munari et al. 2005), and compared them with the observed measurements given by three empirical libraries (Valdes et al.2004; Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006; Prugniel & Soubiran 2001).

In this first paper, I present a new set of simplified equations modeling the growth and migration of various species of grains in a gaseous protostellar disk evolving as a result of the combined effects of viscous accretion and photo-evaporation from the central star. Using the assumption that the grain size distribution function always maintains a power-law structure approximating the average outcome of the exact coagulation/shattering equation, the model focuses on the calculation of the growth rate of the largest grains only. The coupled evolution equations for the maximum grain size, the surface density of the gas and the surface density of solids are then presented and solved self-consistently using a standard 1+1 dimensional formalism. I show that the global evolution of solids is controlled by a leaky reservoir of small grains at large radii, and propose an empirically derived evolution equation for the total mass of solids, which can be used to estimate the total heavy element retention efficiency in the planet formation paradigm.

In both experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates of these particles.

We propose a model for sparse multipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on non-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication of sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the channel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath, scale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth product). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that uses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler manifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity perspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between coherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space dimension without the need for peaky signaling.

The most massive SAGB stars have cores that may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass because of continued shell-burning. Their cores collapse, triggering a so called electron capture supernovae (ECSN). From stellar evolution models we find that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5 ... 9.25\\msun. We perform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to investigate the sensitivity of this mass range to some of the uncertainties in current stellar models. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment of semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of a large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct synthetic SAGB models that include a semi-analytical treatment of dredge-up, hot-bottom burning, and thermal pulse properties. This synthetic model enables us to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset of thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered by the stellar wind. Thereby, we determine the stellar initial mass ranges that produce ONe-white dwarfs and electron-capture supernovae.

The kinetic model predicts that the looped DNA-protein complexes are able to undergo a transition from a helical to a non-helical conformation, and that the transition is triggered by the reversible binding of a protein to the looped DNA. The kinetic model predicts that the transition is triggered by the reversible binding of a protein to the looped DNA.", "model": "flan-t5", "source": "", "source_ID": 704.2409}

The first part is concerned with the study of ideals in the ring $C^\\infty(M,R)$ of smooth functions on a compact smooth manifold M or more generally submodules of a finitely generated $C^\\infty(M,R)$-module V. We define a topology on the space of all submodules of V of a fixed finite codimension d. Its main property is that it is compact Hausdorff and, in the case of ideals in the ring itself, it contains as a subspace the configuration space of d distinct unordered points in M and therefore gives a \"compactification\" of this configuration space. We present a concrete description of this space for low codimensions.   The main focus is then put on the second part which is concerned with a generalization of Vassiliev's h-principle.

We have confirmed the physical connection of the huge filament extending over 20 Mpc in the N-S direction, and another filament extending from the main cluster to the East. Based on a simple energy argument, we show that it is likely that most of the clumps are bound to the main CL0016 cluster.

We draw star formation histories of galaxies from the composite spectra of red galaxies in field, group, and cluster environments. Combining the results from our previous studies, we find that red galaxies in groups at z~0.8 and red field galaxies at z~0.5 show strong Hd absorption lines for their D4000 indices. These are the environments in which we observed the on-going build-up of the colour-magnitude relation in our previous photometric analyses. The strong Hd absorption lines imply that their star formation is truncated on a relatively short time scale.

The targets are members of the Tucana and Beta Pictoris moving groups apart from the somewhat older star HIP 71395 that has a radial velocity trend suggesting a massive planet in large orbit. The survey was carried out in the L-band using adaptive optics assisted imaging with NAOS-CONICA (NACO) at the VLT. The chosen observation wavelength is well suited to search for close companions around young stars and delivers unprecedented detection limits.

The companion to 51 Eri, GJ 3305, was found to be a very close binary on an eccentric orbit. No substellar companions were found around the target stars, although the method permitted to detect companions down to a few Jupiter masses at orbital distances of typically 5 astronomical units.

The main question that we intend to answer is whether the super-massive black holes powering these QSOs grew out from the seeds planted by the first intermediate massive black holes created in the universe. This question involves a dynamical range of 10^13 in mass and we address it by combining N-body simulations of structure formation to identify the most massive halos at z~6 with a Monte Carlo method based on linear theory to obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the whole simulation box. We show that the descendants of the first ~10^6 Msun virialized halos do not, on average, end up in the most massive halos at z~6, but rather live in a large variety of environments. The oldest PopIII progenitors of the most massive halos at z~6, form instead from density peaks that are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the first PopIII star formed in the volume occupied by one bright high-z QSO. The intermediate mass black hole seeds planted by the very first PopIII stars at z>40 can easily grow to masses m_BH>10^9.5 Msun by z=6 assuming Eddington accretion with radiative efficiency \\epsilon~0.1. Quenching of the black hole accretion is therefore crucial to avoid an overabundance of supermassive black holes at lower redshift. This can be obtained if the mass accretion is limited to a fraction \\eta~6*10^{-3} of the total baryon mass of the halo hosting the black hole.

Commonly, light bridges indicate that a the merging of magnetic regions or, conversely, the breakup of the area is underway. We investigate the velocity structure of a solar pore (AR10812) with light bridge, and of the quiet solar photosphere nearby, analyzing high spatial and spectral resolution images.

We also computed the Line of Sight (LoS) velocity field associated to the Fe I and Fe II photospheric lines. The amplitude of the LoS velocity fluctuations, inside the pore, is smaller than that observed in the quiet granulation near the active region. We computed the azimuthal average LoS velocity and derived its radial profile. The whole pore is characterized by a downward velocity -200 m/s and by an annular downflow structure with an average velocity of -350 m/s with respect to the nearby quiet sun. The light bridge inside the pore, when observed in the broad-band channel of IBIS and in the red wing of Ca II 854.2 nm line, shows an elongated dark structure running along its axis, that we explain with a semi-analytical model.

{"prompt": "A density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics: retrieving the\n  noise", "human_text": "  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state, the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor. As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we consider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump process Schr\\\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment behaves like the latter.

We exploit calculations within a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism adjusted for QCD, in order to extract an ``experimental'' strong coupling \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) below 1 GeV by comparison with the meson spectrum. The BS potential follows from a proper ansatz on the Wilson loop to encode confinement and is the sum of a one-gluon-exchange and a confinement terms. Besides, the common perturbative strong coupling is replaced by the ghost-free expression \\alpha_E(Q^2) according to the prescription of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT). The agreement of \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) with the APT coupling \\alpha_E(Q^2) turns out to be reasonable from 1 GeV down to the 200 MeV scale, thus confirming quantitatively the validity of the APT prescription. Below this scale, the experimental points could give a hint on the vanishing of \\alpha_s(Q^2) as Q approaches zero. This infrared behaviour would be consistent with some lattice results and a ``massive'' generalization of the APT approach.

We refer to such collective movements of the RNAPs as RNAP traffic because of the similarities between the collective dynamics of the RNAPs on ssDNA track and that of vehicles in highway traffic. In this paper we develop a theoretical model for RNAP traffic by incorporating the steric interactions between RNAPs as well as the mechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during the elongation of the mRNA.

If the emitter moves towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees with current observations.

We first derive an analytical formula for surface density profile near the planetary orbit from considerations of the balance of force and the dynamical stability. Using it in the empirical formula linking surface density with gas accretion rate that is derived based on hydrodynamic simulations of Tanigawa and Watanabe (2002, ApJ 586, 506), we then simulate the mass evolution of gas giant planets in viscously-evolving disks. We finally determine the final mass as a function of semi-major axis of the planet. We find that the disk can be divided into three regions characterized by different processes by which the final mass is determined. In the inner region, the planet grows quickly and forms a deep gap to suppress the growth by itself before disk dissipation. The final mass of the planet in this region is found to increase with the semi-major axis in a similar way to the mass given by the viscous condition for gap opening, but the former is larger by a factor of approximately 10 than the latter. In the intermediate region, viscous diffusion of the disk gas limits the gas accretion before the planet form a deep gap. The final mass can be up to the disk mass, when disk viscous evolution occurs faster than disk evaporation.

Above this scale, gravity is primarily mediated by the zero mode, while the resonance gives only minor corrections. Next, we consider an asymmetric version of the standard non-compact GRS model, characterized by different cosmological constants on each AdS side.

Analysis of the brightest infrared region of the system, which contributes ~18.5 % of the total 16\\micron flux, indicates that unlike similar off-nuclear infrared-bright regions found in Arp 299 or NGC 4038/9, its MIR spectrum is inconsistent with an enshrouded hot dust (T > 300K) component. Instead, the three brightest MIR regions all display dust continua of temperatures less than ~ 200K.

We find that the overall binary fraction of a cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase (occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or less).

Spectral data from the RGS instruments reveal several strong soft X-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like and helium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. Radiative recombination continua (RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that the emission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDY photoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column density model (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing all detected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-like triplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data were ignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux from intercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonance line data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only two components. We found that observed oxygen G and R ratios especially were anomalous in parameter space investigated. We investigated, and were forced to dismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could be responsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. We succeeded in modeling the observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density (10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high covering factor. While sufficient to reproduce observed soft X-ray flux, our model faces certain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the line profile.

In silcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway. However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.   Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.   Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location, downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated spatio-temporal expansion rate.

Data for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation.

From ten observing sessions, we determine the variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation.

To construct such a model, we begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence, using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the substrate.

The disk model includes viscous evolution and mass loss via photoevaporation. Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly selected subsample of planets from the Lick / Keck / AAT planet search programs, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk at a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription, and become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the radial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet masses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by existing data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample of planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model predicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of orbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet population. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon the adopted disk model.

Radial number density profiles of bright and faint red giant branch (RGB) stars were found to change their slopes at around the tidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. A smoothed surface brightness map of Leo II suggests the existence of a small substructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. We investigated the properties of the stellar population by means of the color-magnitude diagram. The horizontal branch (HB) morphology index shows a radial gradient in which red HB stars are more concentrated than blue HB stars, which is common to many Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The color distribution of RGB stars around the mean RGB sequence shows a larger dispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellar populations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts. Based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (SGB) stars, we found that although the major star formation took place ~8 Gyr ago, a considerable stellar population younger than 8 Gyr is found at the center; such a younger population is insignificant in the outskirts.

Flux limits from the days before discovery combined with the initial rapid brightening suggest the supernova was first detected just hours after shock breakout. Optical spectra obtained about 2 days after breakout exhibit narrow emission lines corresponding to HeII 4200, HeII 4686, and CIV 5805 in the rest frame, and these features persist in a second observation obtained 5 hours later; however, these emission lines are not detected the following night nor in subsequent observations. We suggest that these lines emanate from material close to the explosion site, possibly in the outer layers of the progenitor that have been ionized by the high energy photons released at shock breakout. A P-Cygni profile is observed around 4450 A in the +2 and +3 day spectra. Previous studies have attributed this feature to high velocity H-beta, but we discuss the possibility that this profile is instead due to HeII 4687. Further HET observations (14 nights in total) covering the spectral evolution across the photometric plateau up to 73 days after breakout and during the nebular phase around day +340 are presented, and expansion velocities are derived for key features.

The occurence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential operators is due to the existence of quasimodes, i.e., approximate local solutions to the eigenvalue problem. For scalar operators, the quasimodes appear since the bracket condition is not satisfied for topological reasons, see the paper by Dencker, Sjostrand and Zworski in Comm. Pure Appl.

For example, a one Solar-mass (M_Sun) star would be pulled by roughly 1 mas by a one Jupiter-mass (M_J) planet with a period of one-hundred years at a distance of 20 pc. Such position accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based and space-based telescopes. The difficulty was that it often takes many decades before a detectable position shift will occur. However, by the time the next generation of astrometric missions such as SIM will be taking data, several decades will have past since the first astrometric mission, HIPPARCOS. Here we propose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurate SIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Using position errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection and characterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500) years for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby stars can be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may be quite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets with long-period orbits. Such a data set would nicely complement the short-period systems found by the radial-velocity method. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar companions can be found and characterized if their periods are shorter than about 500 years.

In fact, the competing fields causes the occurrence of an interface between magnetic domains of different orientation.

We measured Be in three open clusters,complementing existing Be surveys, and aiming at gathering a more complete empirical scenario of the evolution of Be as a function of stellar age and temperature. Specifically, we analyzed VLT/UVES spectra of members of NGC 2516, the Hyades, and M 67 to determine their Be and Li abundances. In the first two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 K, while the M 67 sample includes stars warmer than 6150 K, as well as two subgiants and two blue stragglers. We also computed the evolution of Be for a 0.9 Mo star based on standard evolutionary models. We find different emprical behaviours for stars in different temperature bins and ages. Stars warmer than 6150 K show Be depletion and follow a Be vs. Li correlation while Be is undepleted in stars in the ~6150-5600 K range. NGC 2516 members cooler than 5400 K have not depleted any Be, but older Hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. Be is severely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. The results for warm stars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that mixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. The same holds for the two subgiants that have evolved from the \"Li gap\". This mechanism is instead not the dominant one for solar-type stars. We show that Be depletion of cool Hyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of the convective zone.

{"prompt": "Stability Analysis of a Hybrid Cellular Automaton Model of Cell Colony\n  Growth", "human_text": "  Cell colonies of bacteria, tumour cells and fungi, under nutrient limited growth conditions, exhibit complex branched growth patterns. In order to investigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model of cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a nutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it falls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the nutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the colony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like morphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is branched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous results, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear stability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the colony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate dispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion relation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient penetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration distance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption rates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched growth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is reduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet regularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the average branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows good agreement between theory and simulations.

When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster, available in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in this cluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7 dex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter is six times larger than what expected from the observational error.

The focusing effect due to the attractive Coulomb field of a homogeneously charged sphere on a classical ensemble of charged particles incident on the field is calculated in the highly relativistic limit and compared to results obtained from exact solutions of the Dirac equation. The result is relevant for the theoretical foundation of the effective momentum approximation and describes the high energy behavior of the amplitude of continuum Dirac waves in the potential of a homogeneously charged sphere. Our findings indicate that the effective momentum approximation is a useful approximation for the calculation of Coulomb corrections in (e,e') scattering off heavy nuclei for sufficiently high electron energies and momentum transfer.

By proposing a thought experiment based on the construction of a Michelson-Morley interferometer made of quasi-particles, we show that a real Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction takes place, so that internal observers are unable to find out anything about their `absolute ' state of motion.

Subgroups of the affine global symmetry group of toroidally compactified supergravity can be gauged by coupling vector fields with minimal couplings and a particular topological term. The gauge groups typically include hidden symmetries that are not among the target-space isometries of the ungauged theory. The possible gaugings are described group-theoretically in terms of a constant embedding tensor subject to a number of constraints which parametrizes the different theories and entirely encodes the gauged Lagrangian.   The prime example is the bosonic sector of the maximally supersymmetric theory whose ungauged version admits an affine E_9 global symmetry algebra. The various parameters (related to higher-dimensional p-form fluxes, geometric and non-geometric fluxes, etc.) which characterize the possible gaugings, combine into an embedding tensor transforming in the basic representation of E_9.

A list of grand minima and maxima of solar activity is presented for the Holocene (since 9500 BC) and the statistics of both the length of individual events as well as the waiting time between them are analyzed.   The occurrence of grand minima/maxima is driven not by long-term cyclic variability, but by a stochastic/chaotic process. The waiting time distribution of the occurrence of grand minima/maxima deviates from an exponential distribution, implying that these events tend to cluster together with long event-free periods between the clusters. Two different types of grand minima are observed: short (30--90 years) minima of Maunder type and long ($>$110 years) minima of Sp\\\"orer type, implying that a deterministic behaviour of the dynamo during a grand minimum defines its length.

We have investigated how the assumption of different star formation histories affects the dust production rates, the dust depletion, the dust accretion and destruction rates. We have shown how the inclusion of the dust treatment is helpful in solving the so-called Fe discrepancy, observed in the hot gaseous halos of local ellipticals, and in reproducing the chemical abundances observed in the Lyman Break Galaxies.

Such intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We analyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or BH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance in a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a compact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss tidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we predict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs will have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions, which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields eccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among IMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities, around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the resulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs per year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We also estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using circular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities we expect, this loss is negligible.

Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used to decompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. The parameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2 minimization techniques.   Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent with previous work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than that for stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelength than the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seen face-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiative transfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, with changes in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits including scattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust disk which has been invoked to explain observations of dust emission in the submillimeter. I discuss the model degeneracies and the effect of complex structures on the fitted distributions. In particular, most bulges in the sample show a box/peanuts morphology with large residuals; two lower-inclination galaxies show a dust ring distribution, which could be the cause for the large fitted dust scalelengths.

The study of diffusion on such networks is motivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on networks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases: in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the Edwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the network Laplacian.

Two scenarios are considered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter uses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded distance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power according to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive transmitter-receiver distances to grow.

Functionally similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.   RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral network.   CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that exist in large populations.

We used helioseismic holography to image the source of seismic waves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acoustic egression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compact acoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray and visible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two major opposing umbrae in the $\\delta$-configuration sunspot that predominates AR10720. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hard X-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. The visible continuum emission is estimated at $2.0 \\times 10^{23}$ J, approximately 500 times the seismic emission of $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{20}$ J. The flare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between the sources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission as previous flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may be driven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception in that there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in the particle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. The continued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficient white-light flare lends substantial support to the ``back -- warming'' hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmer and Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in white-light flares.

{"prompt": "Discrete Thermodynamics of Lasers", "human_text": "  The paper offers a discrete thermodynamic model of lasers. Laser is an open system; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one related to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The basic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to which are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the relative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity correspondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of the up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even in a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and down), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the population inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the Einstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel lasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for the emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the lasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper and lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel laser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between levels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for the functioning of laser.

In addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous leading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics. The large size of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control their impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding their intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system, and we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of large orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact.

The densities, metallicities, Doppler parameters, and column densities of these systems are compared to those of other weak MgII systems at lower redshift.

The number density per unit redshift is known to decrease for weak MgII absorbers between z~1 and z~2 by a greater amount than predicted from cosmological effects and changes in the extragalactic ionizing background alone. We suggest that, because the physical properties of the absorber population are not seen to change significantly across this range, that the evolution in dN/dz is due to a decrease in the activity that gives rise to weak MgII absorption, and not due to a change in the processes that form weak MgII absorbers. The presence of separate, but aligned (in velocity) low and high density clouds in all single cloud weak MgII absorbers provides an important diagnostic of their geometry.

We show that the tilting of the phenyl rings results in a decrease of the zero-temperature conductance by roughly two orders of magnitude, when going from a planar conformation to a configuration in which the rings are perpendicular. In addition we demonstrate that the side groups, apart from determining phi, have no influence on the conductance. All this is in agreement with the recent experiment by Venkataraman et al.

We explicitly confirm this prediction analytically for a circular ring with a smooth boundary modelled by a space-dependent mass term in the Dirac equation. This model describes rings with zero or weak intervalley scattering so that the valley isospin is a good quantum number. The tunable breaking of the valley degeneracy by the flux allows for the controlled manipulation of valley isospins. We compare our analytical model to another type of ring with strong intervalley scattering. For the latter case, we study a ring of hexagonal form with lattice-terminated zigzag edges numerically.

The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core (SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1 also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1.

One solution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here, several different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All wavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the receiver to regain and redirect the information channels. These separators are so-called Demultiplexers.

CMEs originating in active regions and accompanied by strong flares are usually faster and accelerated more impulsively than CMEs associated with filament eruptions outside active regions and weak flares. It has been proposed more than two decades ago that there are two separate types of CMEs, fast (impulsive) CMEs and slow (gradual) CMEs. However, this concept may not be valid, since the large data sets acquired in recent years do not show two distinct peaks in the CME velocity distribution and reveal that both fast and slow CMEs can be accompanied by both weak and strong flares. We present numerical simulations which confirm our earlier analytical result that a flux-rope CME model permits describing fast and slow CMEs in a unified manner. We consider a force-free coronal magnetic flux rope embedded in the potential field of model bipolar and quadrupolar active regions. The eruption is driven by the torus instability which occurs if the field overlying the flux rope decreases sufficiently rapidly with height. The acceleration profile depends on the steepness of this field decrease, corresponding to fast CMEs for rapid decrease, as is typical of active regions, and to slow CMEs for gentle decrease, as is typical of the quiet Sun.

Thus in this work, we discuss how to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a summary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major watermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely centers upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and detectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to a particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the performance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends on the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the performance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference. Thus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the multiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the optimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection schemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum schemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with the perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level discourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this work, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs from the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not reject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be easily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of embedding strength.

Our results are compared with published values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em = 107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD = 1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun.

The dynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell equations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The bubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar wind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct value of E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we argue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to be significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that for a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly magnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven mass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the energy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes progressively more collimated, producing the GRB.

A natural production site of this radiation is the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive mass black hole (BH). Because of the low bolometric luminosity, the nucleus of M 87 is effectively transparent for gamma rays up to energy of 10 TeV, which makes this source an ideal laboratory for study of particle acceleration processes close to the BH event horizon. We critically analyse different possible radiation mechanisms in this region, and argue that the observed very high-energy gamma ray emission can be explained by the inverse Compton emission of ultrarelativistic electron-positron pairs produced through the development of an electromagnetic cascade in the BH magnetosphere.

A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usual uniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two directors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three- dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic phase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles with low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles not possessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is destabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic order persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of these transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture has been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is different from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixing behaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures may be good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in monolayers of hard particles.

The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and the sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO 137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with both an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail.

In this study we present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected, pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental rules and constraints for cortical networks.

We found that the Bardeen-Petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radius of the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spin parameter).

Our aim is not just to provide a functional for a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of fundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities with the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations of three particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap. These configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure functionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This failure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low density limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive the functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The correct dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to follow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not have lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard hexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the one for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densities through a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart from studying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of the functional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.

We show that, apart from the phenomenon of the solitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the $n/t$-pane contains $g+2$ areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution in the same isospectral torus. In between there are $g+1$ regions where the perturbed solution is asymptotically close to a modulated lattice which undergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which interpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the free lattice ($g=0$) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we recover the known result.   Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are explicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying hyperelliptic curve.

Novelties include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise, on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster for larger data sets.

The spin polarization arising from splitting between the light and the heavy hole bands shows a resonant peak at a certain magnetic field. Especially, the competition between the Luttinger term and the structural inversion asymmetry leads to a rich resonant peaks structure, and the required magnetic field for the resonance may be effectively reduced by enlarging the effective width of the quantum well. Furthermore, the Zeeman splitting tends to move the resonant spin polarization to a relative high magnetic field and destroy these rich resonant spin phenomena. Finally, both the height and the weight of the resonant peak increase as the temperature decreases.

In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a) Haloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it.

We also provide analytic formulae for the lens potentials of Sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index.

For our isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifth or seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow all orders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, while ensuring a non-divergent total mass. We show how the observables predicted by this profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass NFW profile. Expressions for the gravitational flexion are highlighted. We show how decreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing a framework for a fuller investigation of dark matter substructure in galaxies and clusters.

Solar-system tests alone place only weak bounds on these models, since the additional scalar degree of freedom is locked to the high-curvature general-relativistic prediction across more than 25 orders of magnitude in density, out through the solar corona. This agreement requires that the galactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature in the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic halo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper potentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| > 10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the acceleration epoch.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides.

The key problem, that we try to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL Pomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We demonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions : (i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic interpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a Hamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the second is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather complicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be reduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space if the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the transverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of Langevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one integrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL Pomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$ of Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two processes: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into one dipole.

Stellar surface structures are likely to produce fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star, as well as a variation of the observed photocentre, i.e. astrometric jitter, and closure phase. We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations to derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric, photometric, and radial-velocity effects. For most stellar types the astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order 10 micro-AU or greater. This is more than the astrometric displacement typically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone, which is about 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars. Only for stars with extremely low photometric variability (<0.5 mmag) and low magnetic activity, comparable to that of the Sun, will the astrometric jitter be of order 1 micro-AU, suffcient to allow the astrometric detection of an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. While stellar surface structure may thus seriously impair the astrometric detection of small exoplanets, it has in general negligible impact on the detection of large (Jupiter-size) planets and on the determination of stellar parallax and proper motion.

Despite providing a good fit to the data, current spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an accretion disk wind are ad-hoc in their treatment of the properties of the wind material. In order to address these limitations we adopt a numerical computation method that links a series of radiative transfer calculations, incorporating the effect of a global velocity field in a self-consistent manner (XSCORT). We present a series of example spectra from the XSCORT code that allow us to examine the shape of AGN X-ray spectra seen through a wind, for a range of velocity and density distributions, total column densities and initial ionization parameters. These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable complexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The presence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both the previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of AGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are unlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most significant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the models is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity of the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity dispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting in a spectrum similar to the previous models. Such a fast moving outflow cannot be associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind, however the presence of a highly relativistic jet may provide an origin for such material.

Based on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be approached by the finite-SNR one.

Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to estimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain definition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results in very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and, hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For this definition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number of antennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, the diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of the channel. While the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse does not capture this effect, the size-asymptotic DMT does.

{"prompt": "The Dynamical State fo the Starless Dense Core FeSt 1-457: A Pulsating\n  Globule?", "human_text": "  High resolution molecular line observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ were obtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate its kinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+ confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while N2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual extinction.

{"prompt": "On the origin of kinematic distribution of the sub-parsec young stars in\n  the Galactic center", "human_text": "  Within a half-parsec from the Galactic center (GC), there is a population of coeval young stars which appear to reside in a coherent disk. Surrounding this dynamically-cool stellar system, there is a population of stars with a similar age and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. We propose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. Without specifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that both stellar populations were formed within a disk some 6 Myr ago. But this orderly structure was dynamically perturbed outside-in by an intruding object with a mass ~10^4 Msun, which may be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a dark stellar cluster hosting an IMBH. We suggest that the perturber migrated inward to ~0.15-0.3pc from the GC under the action of dynamical friction. Along the way, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean-motion resonance, forced them to migrate with it, closely encountered with them, and induced the growth of their eccentricity and inclination. But stars in the inner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. We predict that some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may have similar Galactocentric semimajor axis. Future precision determination of their kinematic distribution of these stars will not only provide a test for this hypothesis but also evidences for the presence of an IMBH or a dark cluster at the immediate proximity of the massive black hole at the GC.

Motivated by the hypothesis that massive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies are a natural birthsite for GRB progenitors, we present a comparison study of the ISM properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, NGC1705-1, and those in distant GRB hosts. Using the same set of metal transitions in the UV and applying known ISM structures in NGC1705, we find that NGC1705-1 resembles distant GRB host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low molecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dust depletion. The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field in the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB progenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at r<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+ ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to produce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the apparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization transitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers important clues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies.

We ray-trace three light beams through each model to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler to recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations.

Here we show that these GCs with extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass. The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity. Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion origin.

Exposure times varied from 1 - 4 hours to determine the minimum exposure for AAOmega to make an essentially complete LRG redshift survey in average conditions. We show that LRG redshifts to i<20.5 can measured in approximately 1.5hr exposures and present comparisons with 2SLAQ and COMBO-17 (photo-)redshifts. Crucially, the riz selection coupled with the 3-4 times improved AAOmega throughput is shown to extend the LRG mean redshift from z=0.55 for 2SLAQ to z=0.681+/- 0.005 for riz-selected LRGs. This extended range is vital for maximising the S/N for the detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs).

The masses of the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun).

Many efforts are being made to characterize extrasolar planetary systems and unveil the fundamental mechanisms of planet formation. An important aspect of the problem, which remains largely unknown, is to understand how the planet formation process depends on the mass of the parent star. In particular, as most planets discovered to date orbit a solar-mass primary, little is known about planet formation around more massive stars. Aims. To investigate this point, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around red giants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. We choose clusters harbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 M_sun, using the well-known cluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. We are therefore exploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring new insights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We are following a sample of about 115 red giants with the Coralie and HARPS spectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements and detect giant planets around these stars. We use bisector and activity index diagnostics to distinguish between planetary-induced RV variations and stellar photospheric jitter. Results.

There also seems to be a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programming decoder \\cite{Koetter}. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties have not nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP) algorithm.   We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize the stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to capacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).   We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant $1/\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm. However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates between 0.3 and 0.9.   We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open questions related to the MS algorithm.

A neural circuit can be thought of as a directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse. It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined. The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance to hemodynamics has been outlined.

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry $SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered. However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.

The main motivation for considering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity and the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely impact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample eigenvectors.   There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample eigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor strictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). The fundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too few samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the actual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in an asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme, including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors can only exacerbate the situation.

The aim of this paper is to identify and characterise the physical and kinematic properties of the external star forming regions in a sample of ULIRGs, including TDG candidates, using optical IFS and high angular resolution HST imaging. We have found that the presence of external star-forming regions is common with 12 objects being identified in 5 ULIRGs.

This is attained by lowering the energy scale of inflation, thereby highly suppressing the amount of gravitational waves produced during inflation. We compute the power-spectrum of the gravitational waves generated at second order in perturbation theory by the curvaton (isocurvature) perturbations between the end of inflation and the curvaton decay.

Starting from the above evidence, supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities.

The analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a systematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In particular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only up to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical mechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the quantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the interaction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore equivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological fluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric field in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the case of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is notoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted from the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe can be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal themselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can be considered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.

We find that fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential disks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors, whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the large amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable fits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is above that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly underestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with simulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for spheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking out neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this important systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding error affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted for in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields with GIM2D.

For dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied.

The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus, is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat theorem.

Pure HCOOH ices deposited at 15 K and 145 K are studied, as well as binary and tertiary mixtures containing H2O, CO, CO2 and CH3OH. The mixture concentrations are varied from 50:50% to ~10:90% for HCOOH:H2O. Binary mixtures of HCOOH:X and tertiary mixtures of HCOOH:H2O:X with X = CO, CO2, and CH3OH, are studied for concentrations of ~10:90% and ~7:67:26%, respectively. Results: Pure HCOOH ice spectra show broad bands which split around 120 K due to the conversion of a dimer to a chain-structure. Broad single component bands are found for mixtures with H2O.

We find that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic charges.

The sequence of eclipse maps of the 2000 July outburst reveal that the disk shrinks at outburst onset while an uneclipsed component of 13 per cent of the total light develops.

A comparison of the measured cooling wave velocity on consecutive nights indicates that the cooling wave accelerates as it travels towards disk center, in contradiction with the prediction of the disk instability model.

The state space of this walk is a sphere of dimension $3N - 4$. The Kac conjecture concerns the spectral gap in the one step transition operator $Q$ for this walk. In this paper, we compute the exact spectral gap.   As in previous work by Carlen, Carvalho and Loss where a lower bound on the spectral gap was proved, we use a method that relates the spectral properties of $Q$ to the spectral properties of a simpler operator $P$, which is simply an average of certain non commuting projections. The new feature is that we show how to use a knowledge of certain eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $P$ to determine spectral properties of $Q$, instead of simply using the spectral gap for $P$ to bound the spectral gap for $Q$, inductively in $N$, as in previous work. The methods developed here can be applied to many other high--dimensional stochastic process, as we shall explain.

ECHO is aimed at providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures, appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate, efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves.

{"prompt": "Clustering by soft-constraint affinity propagation: Applications to\n  gene-expression data", "human_text": "  Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem appearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques was proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and exemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its present form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having exactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped clusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene expression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP hard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints compared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to interpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest neighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint affinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to more stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is introduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is reduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter selection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data, including in particular microarray data related to various cancer types.

For z~2 galaxies with moderate luminosities(L_{8um}<10^{11}L_sun), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However,20--30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L_{8um}>10^{11}L_sun, show a mid-IR excess which is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24um-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0, respectively.

We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h.

We investigate the cross-covariance between the cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo model approach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlations of the underlying mass density field. Fully taking into account the cross-covariance as well as non-Gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrum covariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing power spectrum signals at multipoles l~10^3 and the cluster counts containing halos with masses M>10^{14}Msun. Including the cross-covariance for the combined measurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noise ratios up to plus or minus 20% relative to when the two are independent. For cosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effect as a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying that the two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation.

It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper subclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame perfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the end of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued payoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals, works of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This paper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff functions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the usual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes, called preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still be defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are equivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect equilibrium.

A general feature of this hybrid model is a steep fall-off of the fusion cross section, sharp increase of logarithmic derivative L(E) with decreasing energy and the astrophysical S-factor showing a maxima at deep sub-barrier energies particularly for near symmetric systems.

In the isotropic limit the XY variables are expected to be disordered before the Ising variables when thermal or quantum fluctuations are turned on gradually. In the anisotropic limit with zero perpendicular hoppings, the finite temperature transition is a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by proliferation of hybrid half vortices, and the zero temperature quantum phase transition is split into a bond order transition and a 3D XY transition, which can be driven by the condensation of either single vortices or half vortices.

It is possible, even likely, that terrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes; consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an important consideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer (2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar Neighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate potential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from the Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis shows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit with substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from -0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day. Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a complete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is broadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the Galactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary companions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions within 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that those systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older, lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implying membership of the thick disk.

As functions of P, we monitor changes in solid fraction \\Phi, coordination number z, proportion of rattlers (grains carrying no force) x0, the distribution of normal forces, the level of friction mobilization, and the distribution of near neighbor distances. Assuming the contact law does not involve material plasticity or damage, \\Phi is found to vary very nearly reversibly with P in an isotropic compression cycle, but all other quantities, due to the frictional hysteresis of contact forces, change irreversibly. In particular, initial low P states with high coordination numbers lose many contacts in a compression cycle, and end up with values of z and x0 close to those of the most poorly coordinated initial configurations.

We review here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro with the dynamic-clamp technique.

Such comparisons hinge not only on the overall metal abundance but also on relative abundances. Studies have examined the influence of individual elements on synthetic spectra but little has been done to address similar issues in the stellar evolution models that underlie most stellar population models. Stellar evolution models will primarily be influenced by changes in opacities. In order to explore this issue in detail, twelve sets of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones have been created at constant heavy element mass fraction Z that self-consistently account for varying heavy element mixtures. These sets include scaled-solar, alpha-enhanced, and individual cases where the elements C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe have been enhanced above their scaled-solar values. The variations that arise between scaled-solar and the other cases are examined with respect to the H-R diagram and main sequence lifetimes.

These results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite 4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good metric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction loci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness of the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no wall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur. Moreover, we notice that, for low instanton numbers, the corresponding moduli spaces are a priori compact and contain no reductions at all so, in these cases, the existence of well-defined Donaldson type invariants is obvious.

A salient feature of this model is the possibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger stars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time, takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template spectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with features closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of spectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing these spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related to each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem, i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in different age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the recovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error bars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible solutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS subsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yielding excellent agreement.

For this reason it is necessary to investigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals produced by their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (ICM). This work is focussed on the polarization effect induced by the ICM bulk motions, the so-called kpSZ signal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to the square of the tangential velocity. In particular we study how this polarization signal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is its dependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryonic component. This is done by producing realistic kpSZ maps starting from the outputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body simulations. The first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiative hydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement four different kinds of physical processes. Our results shows that the kpSZ signal turns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxy clusters. We find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to one order of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up to about 100 nuK. This result implies that the internal ICM dynamics must be taken into account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based on spherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates.

Such discussions have largely focused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II) we explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and power spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the distortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the observed correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on large scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc/h, where the intrinsic galaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be enhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~ 0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and magnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The anisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar motions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data as precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillation scale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS orientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias, redshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly bias measurements of the dark energy equation of state.

{"prompt": "How Mergers May Affect The Mass Scaling Relations Between Black Holes,\n  Galaxies, and Other Gravitationally Bound Systems", "human_text": "  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

Some of these stars will result in black hole formation. In this study, we investigate iron core collapse and black hole formation systematically for the iron-core mass range of 3 - 30Msun, which has not been studied well so far. Models used here are mostly isentropic iron cores that may be produced in merged stars in the present universe but we also employ a model that is meant for a Population III star and is obtained by evolutionary calculation. We solve numerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer equations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical symmetry. As a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10Msun unexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons before black hole formation. The features of neutrino signals emitted from such massive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinary supernovae. Firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappears completely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce. Secondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owing to the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We also study the effects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initial density gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines. Further more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors from the neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operating neutrino detectors.

This allows us to handle inflation models that yield spectra that are not well described by the standard spectral parameterization. Using the latest WMAP data-set, we find a high degree of variation in possible spectral shapes.

The modifications primarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at least as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the numerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions.

In this paper we extend our previous numerical investigations, by looking at the process of flux interaction as an initially twisted flux tube emerges into a plane parallel, coronal magnetic field. Significant differences are found in the dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending on the relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexisting coronal field. When the flux systems are nearly anti-parallel, the experiments show substantial reconnection and demonstrate clear signatures of a high temperature plasma located in the high velocity outflow regions extending from the reconnection region. However, the cases that have a more parallel orientation of the flux systems show very limited reconnection and none of the associated features. Despite the very different amount of reconnection between the two flux systems, it is found that the emerging flux that is still connected to the original tube, reaches the same height as a function of time. As a compensation for the loss of tube flux, a clear difference is found in the extent of the emerging loop in the direction perpendicular to the main axis of the initial flux tube. Increasing amounts of magnetic reconnection decrease the volume, which confines the remaining tube flux.

Combining the data from two eclipses, we demonstrate a detection sensitivity of 0.15% in the eclipse depth relative to the stellar flux. This approaches the sensitivity required to detect the planetary emission, which theoretical models predict should lie between 0.05-0.1% of the stellar flux in our 2.9-4.3 micron bandpass. We explore the factors that ultimately limit the precision of this technique, and discuss potential avenues for future improvements.

This effect needs to be disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark energy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the number of tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters and find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many bins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We investigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are included the requirements become a factor of three tighter.

Dominant contributions come from the combinations $B_i \\lambda^{\\prime}_{ij1}$ for which we obtain robust bounds. It turns out that neutron and deuteron EDMs receive much stronger contributions than mercury EDM and any null result at the future deuteron EDM experiment or Los Alamos neutron EDM experiment can lead to extra-ordinary constraints on RPV parameter space.

At each wavelength, the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From the larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming regions are mainly spread over the region $R$ $<$ 4 kpc without a dominant nuclear concentration.

From the behaviour of the mean spectral indices obtained from different pairs of the radio continuum data at 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm, we confirm that a decrease in the thermal fraction causes an increase in the spectral index.

The LAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background radiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The clustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due to either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having caused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the strong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass galaxies like LAEs.

The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core'' galaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. We extend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfert galaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to study their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated galaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be successfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic of ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). This result is what is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thus extending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radio loudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of this result against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightness profiles, using a Sersic law. In no object could we find evidence of a central light deficit with respect to a pure Sersic model, the defining feature of ``core'' galaxies in this modeling framework. We conclude that, regardless of the modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocally related to the host's brightness profile.

We define two sub-groups of ``weak FIR'' and ``strong FIR'' QSOs, and a third group of FIR non-detections. Assuming a starburst origin for the FIR, we obtain ``intrinsic'' AGN SEDs by subtracting a starburst template from the mean SEDs. The resulting SEDs are remarkably similar for all groups. They show three distinct peaks corresponding to two silicate emission features and a 3mic bump that we interpret as the signature of the hottest AGN dust. They also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpret as the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200K) dust. This component must be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of the long wavelength continuum. We discuss the merits of an alternative model where most of the FIR emission is due to AGN heating.

In this letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that accommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy clusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is the mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ half-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using the Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in mass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since measurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ clusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of the cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting cosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our Fundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one may naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while including more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve the accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of non-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the intracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to reduce these errors.

In a vector downlink channel (single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

We consider two scenarios, (A) a lattice with one dimer per unit cell and perfect inter-layer frustration, and (B) an enlarged unit cell with inequivalent layers, with and without perfect frustration. In all situations, the critical behavior at asymptotically low temperatures is three-dimensional, but the corresponding crossover scale may be tiny. Magnetic ordering in case (B) can be discussed in terms of two condensates; remarkably, perfect frustration renders the proximity effect ineffective. Then, the ordering transition will be generically split, with clear signatures in measurable properties. Using a generalized bond-operator method, we calculate the low-temperature magnetic properties in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases.

{"prompt": "Modelling long-term trends in lunar exposure to the Earth's plasmasheet", "human_text": "  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is subject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years. This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030. This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10 hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface. Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.

{"prompt": "Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories?", "human_text": "  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible. However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There may be other torsion theories which do.

Taking a similar perspective as Jackiw and coworkers, we show that non-abelian hydrodynamical currents can be factored in a non-coherent 'classical' part, and a coherent part requiring macroscopic non-abelian quantum entanglement. Non-abelian flow being thus a much richer affair than familiar hydrodynamics, permits us to classify the various spin transport phenomena in in condensed matter physics in a unifying framework.In semiconductor spintronics, the absence of hydrodynamics is well known, but in our formulation it is directly associated with the fact that non-abelian currents are only covariantly conserved.We analyze the quantum mechanical single particle currents of relevance to mesoscopic transport with as highlight the Aharonov-Casher effect, where we demonstrate that the non-abelian transport structure renders it much more fragile than its abelian counterpart, the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We subsequently focus on spin flows protected by order parameters, of which the spin-spiral magnets and the spin superfluids are important examples.

The presence of a FUV-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete (83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~1. We divide the LBG sample into two sub-classes: red LBGs (RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and blue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy. Two of the RLBGs are also detected at 70 micron. The median SED of the RLBGs is similar (above lambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst HR10. However, unlike local (U)LIRGs, RLBGs are UV bright objects. We suggest that these objects contain a large amount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly visible. The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the same stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The luminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity function of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift. The integrated luminosity densities of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies are very consistent.

These structures decay in amplitude, with little sign of downstream merging. The fields start with magnetic energy density $\\sim (0.1-0.2)$ of the upstream kinetic energy within the shock transition, but rapid downstream decay drives the fields to much smaller values, below $10^{-3}$ of equipartition after $10^3$ skin depths.   In an attempt to construct a theory that follows field decay to these smaller values, we explore the hypothesis that the observed damping is a variant of Landau damping in an unmagnetized plasma. The model is based on the small value of the downstream magnetic energy density, which suggests that particle orbits are only weakly perturbed from straight line motion, if the turbulence is homogeneous.

In the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1 keV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black hole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on the spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin. However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist.

In this paper we present analytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust, and metals in high redshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS J1148+5251, a hyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4.

If future observations find this to be a typical supernova dust yield, then additional processes, such as accretion onto preexisting grains, or condensation around the AGN will need to be invoked to account for the large amount of dust in this and similar objects.

For ages younger than 3x10^9 yr the dN/dt distribution can be approximated by a power-law distribution, dN/dt propto t^-beta, with -beta=-0.70+/-0.05 or -beta=-0.84+/-0.04, depending on the model used to derive the ages. Predictions for a cluster population without dissolution limited by a V-band detection result in a power-law dN/dt distribution with an index of ~-0.7. This is because the limiting cluster mass increases with age, due to evolutionary fading of clusters, reducing the number of observed clusters at old ages. When a mass cut well above the limiting cluster mass is applied, the dN/dt distribution is flat up to 1 Gyr. We conclude that cluster dissolution is of small importance in shaping the dN/dt distribution and incompleteness causes dN/dt to decline. The reason that no (mass independent) infant mortality of star clusters in the first ~10-20 Myr is found is explained by a detection bias towards clusters without nebular emission, i.e. cluster that have survived the infant mortality phase. The reason we find no evidence for tidal (mass dependent) cluster dissolution in the first Gyr is explained by the weak tidal field of the SMC. Our results are in sharp contrast to the interpretation of Chandar et al. (2006), who interpret the declining dN/dt distribution as rapid cluster dissolution.

The method allows the steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed, facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator.

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions. Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those observed.

Tenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as compared to load intensity.

We have taken into account not only the anisotropy of the radiation field in the 3D medium and the Hanle effect of a tangled magnetic field, but also the symmetry breaking effects caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities produced by the solar surface convection. Interestingly, the Q/I and U/I linear polarization signals of the emergent spectral line radiation have sizable values and fluctuations, even at the very center of the solar disk where we meet the forward scattering case. The ensuing small-scale patterns in Q/I and U/I turn out to be sensitive to the assumed magnetic field model, and are of great diagnostic value. We argue that it should be possible to observe them with the help of a 1-m telescope equipped with adaptive optics and a suitable polarimeter.

Starting with $N$ independent BECs we couple the condensates through Josephson links and allow the system to reach a stable circulation by adding a dissipative term in our semiclassical equations of motion. The central question we address is what is the probability to trap a vortex with winding number $m$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the final distribution of winding numbers is narrower than the initial distribution of total phases, indicating an increased probability for no-vortex configurations. Further, the nonlinearity of the problem manifests itself in the somewhat counter-intuitive result that it is possible to obtain a non-zero circulation starting with zero total phase around the loop. The final width of the distribution of winding numbers for $N$ sites scales as $\\lambda N^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha=0.47\\pm 0.01$ and $\\lambda <0.67$ (value predicted for the initial distribution) indicating a shrinking of the final distribution.

Lett., 78 (1997), pp. 4733-4736] with a modified semi-implicit Euler iterative scheme and seeding with periodic orbits of neighbouring periods, has been shown to be highly efficient when applied to low-dimensional system. The difficulty in applying the algorithm to higher dimensional systems is mainly due to the fact that the number of stabilising transformations grows extremely fast with increasing system dimension. In this thesis, we construct stabilising transformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already detected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a substantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the efficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of high-dimensional systems.

A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating.

Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolated galaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctly identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. The criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group contamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of the resulting sample. The angular distribution of satellites about their host is biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red disc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour of the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies that were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not responsible for the angular distribution. Satellites that are most likely to have been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as the surrounding large scale structure. The orientations of isolated early and intermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large scale structures.

We compare with observed merger MFs, clustering, fractions, and small-scale environments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations. Making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasar LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is a natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. We show that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk instabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at Seyfert luminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale), pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution, and host galaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z>1 quasar luminosity density.

Together with previous observations and modelling of CO and isotopologues, our H13CO+ and DCO+ observations and modelling allow to place constraints on the metal abundance and the cosmic ionization rate. The H13CO+ emission is well reproduced for metals abundances lower than 3e-9 and a standard cosmic ray ionization rate.

In this way the patterns in the clustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.

The X-ray spectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component.

At the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detected around 0.5-2 keV; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. The power-law is always hard, with a photon index Gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter at times), as is generally the case with bright ULXs. We speculate that this source and perhaps most other bright ULXs are in a high/hard state: as the accretion rate increases well above the Eddington limit, more and more power is extracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels, and is used to power a Comptonizing corona, jet or wind. The observed thermal component comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius between outer standard disk and Comptonizing inner region moves further out and to lower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases.

The color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can achieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the color trend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the [alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H] ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its range many times lower, i.e. of the order of Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.1 or even none, than the corresponding range deduced by assuming no age trend.

PGC 045080 is a moderately distant galaxy having a highly inclined optical disk and massive HI gas content. Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320 MHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in the galaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all three frequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. We also did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not show any strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of a weak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\\alpha$ flux and radio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emission is non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may be present in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes/jets from the AGN. These observations show that although LSB galaxies are metal poor and have very little star formation, their centers can host significant AGN activity. We also mapped the HI gas disk and velocity field in PGC 045080. The HI disk extends well beyond the optical disk and appears warped. In the HI intensity maps, the disk appears distinctly lopsided. The velocity field is disturbed on the lopsided side of the disk but is fairly uniform in the other half. We derived the HI rotation curve for the galaxy from the velocity field.

The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results, including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some 1.5-2 M_sun stars.

The present GRB samples with redshift determination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of selection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the observed GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined samples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift GRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected due to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized, compared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in shaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue that the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be z<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased against low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame afterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration, implies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust composition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is probably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z GRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due to the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of high redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of even 10m class telescopes.

They have the potential to efficiently transport angular momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.   For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains, x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150 g/cm^2).

The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy. Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the Polchinski method.

An achromatic break is observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the break in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour and the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best examples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow light curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is strong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break frequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times and the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at higher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency.

{"prompt": "An absorption origin for the soft excess in Seyfert 1 AGN", "human_text": "  (abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass accretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised accretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state, with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in our fits.

Before reading this paper I had not heard of the \"quadratrix\" before, and I recommend learning a bit about it before reading this. I found Thomas Heath, \"A history of Greek mathematics\", vol.

The usual problem of squaring the circle is to construct a square with the same area (or perimeter) as a given circle, in a finite number of steps using compass and straightedge. Descartes worked in the reverse direction: from a given square he constructed the radius of a circle with the same perimeter, but in an infinite number of steps.   In this paper Euler reconstructs Descartes' argument and develops some consequences of it. Euler finds that \\[ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n} \\tan \\frac{1}{2^n}\\phi = \\frac{1}{\\phi} - 2\\cot 2\\phi. \\] Integrating this yields \\[ \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\sec \\frac{1}{2^n} \\phi = \\frac{2\\phi}{\\sin 2\\phi}. \\]   I'd like to thank Davide Crippa from the University of Paris 7 for some helpful back and forth about this paper.

In our numerical models, GCs form in turbulent,high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are embedded in a massive dark matter halo at high redshifts. We show how high-density, compact stellar systems are formed from GMCs influenced both by physical processes associated with star formation and by tidal fields of their host halos. We also show that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements (e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initial mass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller [C/Fe] have larger [N/Fe] in a GC. Although these results imply that ``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars can cause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with different parameters and canonical IMFs can not show N-rich stars with [N/Fe] ~ 0.8 observed in some GCs (e.g., NGC 6752). We discuss this apparent failure in the context of massive star formation preceding low-mass one within GC-forming GMCs (``bimodal star formation scenario'').

We have obtained high-cadence radial velocity measurements spanning 1.3 years of HD 33636 with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We combined these data with previously published velocities to create a data set that spans nine years. We used this data set to search for, and place mass limits on, the existence of additional companions in the HD 33636 system. Our high-precision astrometric observations of the system with the HST Fine Guidance Sensor 1r span 1.2 years. We simultaneously modeled the radial velocity and astrometry data to determine the parallax, proper motion, and perturbation orbit parameters of HD 33636.

The observed velocity vector (amplitude and direction) of the clusters in the galactic plane is derived from the catalog data.

If for some reason the clusters are formed with non-random initial perturbation velocity direction (measured for instance with respect to the direction of circular rotation), then a plot of the orientation angle of the residual velocity as a function of age reveals the epicycle frequency. The data analysis confirms that this is the case; due to the non-random initial velocities, it is possible to measure $\\kappa$ for different galactic radii.

The equilibria are determined by two free parameters: the downslope flux and a boundary condition. Solutions exhibit a constant downslope flow speed and moisture content for the constant equilibrium flux, which is the product of the two. However where an isolated zone of fixed saturation degree exists representing a boundary condition, the flow speed immediately upslope is reduced and the moisture content correspondingly increased to preserve the constant equilibrium flux. The capillary head jump at the saturated zone produces a blockage that gives a high moisture content back upslope through a pooling distance determined by the equilibrium condition that the downslope flux is constant. In our numerical integrations, the vertically projected pooling height is more than 10 km for a fully saturated zone in mixed silty or clay soils, but decreases by about an order of magnitude with every 10% decrease in the boundary-zone saturation degree. The drying of downhill saturated zones with the increased speed of mountain moisture outflow and corresponding decreased mountain moisture content gives a viable explanation for the mysterious ~69% unaccounted drop seen in the spring outflow in the La Luz / Fresnal Watershed at Alamogordo's upstream spring-box diversions in the semiarid southeastern New Mexico USA.

These events are characterized by long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black hole.

In this work we present a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic templates are based on re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and the gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods as they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials. In this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the features that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding energy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the post-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In this work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a fiducially exact waveform. This waveform is constructed from a hybrid method of using the test-mass results combined with the mass dependent parts of the post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. Our results show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting factors at all PN orders and provide excellent parameter extraction.

To investigate such galaxy-IGM interplay we have generated synthetic optical absorption line spectra piercing the volume surrounding a starbursting analog of a Lyman Break Galaxy selected in a $z \\approx 3$ output from a SPH simulation, including a detailed treatment of mechanical feedback from winds. Distributions for several observable species (HI, CIII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, SiIV, OVI, OVII, and OVIII) have been derived by post-processing the simulation outputs. The hot wind material is characterized by the presence of high-ionization species such as OVI, OVII, and OVIII (the latter two observable only in X-ray bands); the colder ($T<10^{5.5}$ K) infalling streams can be instead identified by the combined presence of SiII, SiIII, and CIII optical absorption together with OVI that surrounds the cooler gas clumps. However, both line profile and Pixel Optical Depth analysis of the synthetic spectra show that the intergalactic filament in which the wind-blowing galaxy is embedded produces absorption signatures that closely mimic those of the wind environment.

Material is launched normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a rotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently. Continuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in line-driven winds.

The patterns appeared in this process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small clusters.

Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the source through temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral and temporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSA v.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once. It was active for about 3.5 hours, a short and bright flare lasting about 1.5 hours is evident in the IBIS light curve. It reached a peak flux of about 80 mCrab or 2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV),corresponding to a peak luminosity of 1.1x10E37 erg sE-1 (assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc).

We show that these planetesimals generally cannot pass through the mean motion resonances of the cores, and the suppression of planetesimal bombardment rate enables the cores to accrete gas with little interruption. During growth from the cores to protoplanets, as the resonances overlap with each other, the trapped planetesimals become dynamically unstable and their eccentricity excitation is strongly enhanced. Subsequent gas drag induces the planetesimals to migrate and collide with the protoplanet.

We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for cooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors and form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward mechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a single cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial fractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability range, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this model as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the emergence of cooperation.

We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and ~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer, recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts.

Using detailed hydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in minihalos subject to destructive processes associated with the encompassing intergalactic shocks carrying metal-enriched gas, we find, as an example, that, for realistic shocks of velocities of 10-100km/s, more than (90%,65%) of the high density gas with rho>500 rhob inside a minihalo virialized at z=10 of mass (10^7,10^6)Msun remains at a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium by redshift z=6. It may be expected that the high density gas in minihalos becomes fuel for subsequent star formation, when they are incorporated into larger halos where efficient atomic cooling can induce gas condensation hence star formation. Since minihalos virialize at high redshift when the universe is not expected to have been significantly reionized, the implication is that gas in virialized minihalos may provide an abundant reservoir of primordial gas to possibly allow for the formation of Population-III metal-free stars to extend to much lower redshift than otherwise expected based on the enrichment of intergalactic medium.

As a consequence,the electrons exhibit a unique type of Hamiltonian chaos, which creates an intricate mesh of conduction channels (a stochastic web) in phase space, leading to a large resonant increase in the current flow at critical values of the applied voltage. This phase-space patterning provides a sensitive mechanism for controlling electrical resistance.

Over the last 8Gyrs, we observe that the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximately constant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over the same timescale. As a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in the quiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in active galaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, we observe a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by a factor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch when an increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity and start to build up the red sequence.

{"prompt": "A generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation", "human_text": "  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced. Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.

{"prompt": "Matrix Exponential-Based Closures for the Turbulent Subgrid-Scale Stress\n  Tensor", "human_text": "  Two approaches for closing the turbulence subgrid-scale stress tensor in terms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is based on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the production terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials. This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to be useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity gradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects. The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables, combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation' (RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures. The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by implementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear scrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential approach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from the stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically motivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.

Although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena, they are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the physical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the continuous dynamics, where each \"symbol\" corresponds to an \"aggregate\" of states in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which software and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic model and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space of the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. For digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental input-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable quantization of the inputs.

The presampled two-dimensional point-spread function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%) narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors. The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values 54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the higher frequency region for both units.

Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared.

This degeneracy is lifted by searching for planets in binary systems; the resulting detections (or evidence of non-existence) of planets in binaries isolates which models may contribute to how planets form in nature. In this chapter, we consider observational efforts to detect planetary companions to binary stars in two types of hierarchical planet-binary configurations: first ``S-type'' planets which orbit just one of the stars, with the binary period being much longer than the planet's; second, ``P-type'' or circumbinary planets, where the planet simultaneously orbits both stars, and the planetary orbital period is much longer than that of the binary. The S-type planet finding techniques are different for binaries that can or cannot be spatially resolved. For wider systems, techniques reviewed include dualstar interferometric differential astrometry and precision radial velocities. Alternatively, unresolved binaries can be studied using modified dualstar \"PHASES-style\" differential astrometry or a modification of the radial velocity technique for composite spectra.

How memories are preserved for months or years, despite molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However, episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses. Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to maintenance of synaptic strength.

In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift.

Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5.

Conversely, ultraluminous X-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. We introduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state.

We focus on the dynamical role of MHD processes after the formation of a millisecond-period protoneutron star. We find that including magnetic fields and stresses can lead to a powerful explosion with an energy of a few Bethe, rather than a weak one of at most 0.1 Bethe, with an associated ejecta mass of ~0.1Msun, instead of a few 0.001Msun. The core is spun down by ~30% within 500ms after bounce, and the rotational energy extracted from the core is channeled into magnetic energy that generates a strong magnetically-driven wind, rather than a weak neutrino-driven wind. Baryon loading of the ejecta, while this wind prevails, precludes it from becoming relativistic. This suggests that a GRB is not expected to emerge from such AICs during the early protoneutron star phase, except in the unlikely event that the massive white dwarf has sufficient mass to lead to black hole formation. In addition, we predict both negligible 56Ni-production (that should result in an optically-dark, adiabatically-cooled explosion) and the ejection of 0.1Msun of material with an electron fraction of 0.1-0.2. Such pollution by neutron-rich nuclei puts strong constraints on the possible rate of such AICs. Moreover, being free from ``fallback,'' such highly-magnetized millisecond-period protoneutron stars may later become magnetars, and the magnetically-driven winds may later transition to Poynting-flux-dominated, relativistic winds, eventually detectable as GRBs at cosmological distances.

We study these models under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in which the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and acts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this approximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit a scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We verify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling. We then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and Hull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the resulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation corresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are given in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show that the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a Tsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.

In this representation the probability distribution function (PDF) W(t) of fluctuation renewals is associated with that of reoccurrences in a certain jump state of some Markovian controlling process. Within the MR the non-Markovian SLE, which describes the effect of CTRW-like noise on relaxation of dynamic and stochastic systems, is generalized to take into account the influence of relaxing systems on statistical properties of noise. The generalized non-Markovian SLE is applied to study two modifications of the CTRW approach. One of them considers the cascaded CTRWs in which the controlling process is actually CTRW-like one controlled by another CTRW process, controlled in turn by the third one, etc. Within the MR simple expression for the PDF W(t) of total controlling process is obtained in terms of Markovian variants of controlling PDFs in the cascade. The expression is shown to be especially simple and instructive in the case of anomalous processes determined by long time tailed W(t). The cascaded CTRWs can model the effect of complexity of a system on relaxation kinetics (in glasses, fractals, branching media, ultrametric structures, etc.).

A way to deal with this problem considers canonical (unique) forms. (Unique canonical form is constructed from an infinitely long trajectory, but many KSs.) Here we introduce canonical forms of reduced dimensions that can handle any KS (i.e. also KSs with symmetry and irreversible transitions). We give the mapping of KSs into reduced dimensions forms, which is based on topology of KSs, and the tools for extracting the reduced dimensions form from finite data.

In a specific frequency range, this 'foreground noise' is predicted to rise above the instrumental noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e.g., gravitational waves arising from stellar mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes. In many previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and Roche-Lobe Overflow Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal. Since >99% of remnant binaries which have orbital periods within the LISA sensitivity range are white dwarf binaries, we consider only these binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but becomes significant at higher frequencies, pushing the frequency at which the foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to >6 mHz. We find that it is important to consider the population of mass transferring binaries in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (~11300) of Galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal-to-noise ratio >5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA.

{"prompt": "Physical Layer Network Coding", "human_text": "  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve 100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that of traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher than 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity.

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16 +/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13 days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component is not ruled out.

The basic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear scheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach leads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to establish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main methodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a non-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in variations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for monotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical analysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of Friedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with non-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) scheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise cubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate approximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the modified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are tested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and robust.

We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the interface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral medium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical simulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of radiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion spreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the CNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to the lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport increase the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O. Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact with the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at the interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content at the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps exciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are found higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical models of the interstellar medium (ISM).

From small clusters to large NCs containing on the order of several thousand atoms are considered. Effective band-gap values as a function of NC diameter reproduce very well the available experimental and theoretical data. It is observed that the highest occupied molecular orbital for both Si and Ge NCs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for Si NCs display oscillations with respect to size among the different irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ point group to which these spherical NCs belong. Based on this electronic structure, first the interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when included. This reduction is found to increase with decreasing NC size or with increasing permittivity mismatch between the NC core and the host matrix. Reasonable agreement is observed with the experimental absorption spectra where available. The deformation of spherical NCs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra. Next, intraconduction and intravalence band absorption coefficients are obtained in the wavelength range from far-infrared to visible region. These results can be valuable for the infrared photodetection prospects of these NC arrays.

Strong emission lines from HII regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions. We compare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify any systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central location for all ionising sources. We find that the dependence of the metallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due to the fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars always display lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.

This property explains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purely mechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger than'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations were considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical) mechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the natural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation value of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations performed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be regarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss how this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over previous attempts.

By introducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case of a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian tangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good agreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data for the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing through the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light is computed. The bending angle obtained for the Bose-Einstein condensate is larger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter models.

For the general case we derive a necessary condition in terms of products of Schmidt coefficients, which is equivalent to the Nielsen condition when either of the two factor spaces is of dimension 2, but is otherwise weaker. One implication is that no separable operation can reverse a deterministic map produced by another separable operation, if one excludes the case where the Schmidt coefficients of $\\ket{\\psi}$ and are the same as those of $\\ket{\\phi}$.

Our derivation is independent of any assumptions about the dynamical behaviour of the field equations, except that it requires anisotropies to be small back to recombination; this is already demanded by observations.   We calculate the polarization signal in the Bianchi VIIh case, with the parameters recently advocated to mimic the several large-angle anomalous features observed in the CMB. We find that the peak polarization signal is ~ 1.2 micro K for the best-fit model to the temperature anisotropies, and is mostly confined to multipoles l<10. Remarkably, the predicted large-angle EE and TE power spectra in the Bianchi model are consistent with WMAP observations that are usually interpreted as evidence of early reionization. However, the power in B-mode polarisation is predicted to be similar to the E-mode power and parity-violating correlations are also predicted by the model; the WMAP non-detection of either of these signals casts further strong doubts on the veracity of attempts to explain the large-angle anomalies with global anisotropy.

We show that in these systems the existence of a preferred frame for gravity leads to an observable characteristic `signature' in the timing data, which uniquely identifies this effect. We expand the standard Damour-Deruelle timing formula to incorporate this `signature' and show how this new PFE timing model can be used to either measure or constrain the parameters related to a violation of the local Lorentz invariance of gravity in the strong internal fields of neutron stars. In particular, we demonstrate that in the presence of PFEs we expect a set of the new timing parameters to have a unique relationship that can be measured and tested incontrovertibly. This new methodology is applied to the Double Pulsar, which turns out to be the ideal test system for this kind of experiments.The currently available dataset allows us only to study the impact of PFEs on the orbital precession rate, d omega/dt, providing limits that are, at the moment, clearly less stringent than existing limits on PFE strong-field parameters. However, simulations show that the constraints improve fast in the coming years, allowing us to study all new PFE timing parameters and to check for the unique relationship between them. Finally, we show how a combination of several suitable systems in a \"PFE antenna array\", expected to be availabe for instance with the Square-Kilometre-Array (SKA), provides full sensitivity to possible violations of local Lorentz invariance in strong gravitational fields in all directions of the sky.

It is shown that, if the zero point energies for the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities, their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density.

This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker (1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbit causes the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit, forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving rise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial) directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not contribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with a weak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit the front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is remarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the other hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly multiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail surrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed density at the back as well as far front of the perturber.

The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussians.

The conventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastable graviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. The self-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for an idea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modified gravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch is obscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, a certain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th/0612016 exhibits a net negative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventional branch.

The metallicities for relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematic fluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-disc scaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., the flare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicity variations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicity variation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic. Three different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected: d[M/H]/dz=-0.22(+/-0.03), d[M/H]/dz=-0.38 (+/-0.06), and d[M/H]/dz=-0.08 (+/-0.07) dex/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively. Since our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resulting metallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scale Galaxy.

The temperature and frequency dependence is sensitive to three energy scales: The dangling-bond spin Zeeman energy delta, as well as the minimum (E_min) and maximum (E_max) values for the energy splittings of the tunneling two-level systems.

Thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance.   The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system.

Dose distributions computed by treatment planning systems are affected by several sources of uncertainty such as algorithm limitations, measurement uncertainty in the data used to model the beam and residual differences between measured and computed dose, once the model is optimized. In order to take into account the effect of uncertainty, a probabilistic approach is proposed and a new kind of histogram, a dose-expected volume histogram, is introduced. The expected value of the volume in the region of interest receiving an absorbed dose equal or greater than a certain value is found using the probability distribution of the dose at each point. A rectangular probability distribution is assumed for this point dose, and a relationship is given for practical computations. This method is applied to a set of dose volume histograms for different regions of interest for 6 brain patients, 8 lung patients, 8 pelvis patients and 6 prostate patients planned for IMRT.

At the inner edge of the inner gas spiral arm the ordered magnetic field is only mildly compressed and turns smoothly, to become aligned along the gas arm. Hence the field is not shocked and is probably connected to the warm, diffuse gas. At larger radii, two bright magnetic arms between the optical arms are visible in polarized intensity. The field in the northern magnetic arm is almost totally aligned. Faraday rotation measures (RM) in these arms are consistent with the superposition of two low azimuthal dynamo modes. Three more magnetic arms are discovered in the outer galaxy, located between HI arms. Due to strong Faraday depolarization the galaxy is not transparent to polarized waves at 18cm and 20cm. The large-scale asymmetry in depolarization with respect to the major axis may be another indication of large-scale helical fields.

Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space, and the wavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to the curvature of space.   2. The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy contained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius has continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.   3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength is invariable.   These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point radiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject to a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1/R_u$. Any increase of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow which translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand indefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible. If the initial radius of the Universe $R_i$ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$, which corresponds to the total mass of the Universe, $M_u$, the generation of matter would have lasted for thousands of millions of years.

The RS consists of Frenet -Serret orthogonal tetrads where the rotating detector is at rest and has a constant acceleration vector. The CFs and the energy density at the rotating reference system should be periodic with rotation period because CF and energy density measurements is one of the tools the detector can use to justify the periodicity of its motion. The CFs have been calculated for both electromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without taking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic CFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the temperature T= h w /k . Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic and massless scalar field it is shown that the detector rotating in the zero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but, above that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial detector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T.

Detection of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on GRB mechanisms. Seventeen short duration (< 5 s) GRBs detected by satellites occurred within the field of view of the Milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 January and 2006 December. We have searched the Milagro data for >100 GeV counterparts to these GRBs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts.

Adequate stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically thin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical mass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping'' impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the optically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions: Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions.

We find similar results when we extend that comparison to include the Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) resonances. With higher statistics, we now also probe the momentum dependence of these per-event particle yields. Next, we compare particle production in the photon-tagged process Upsilon(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e- -> qqbar events, to allow comparison of two-parton with three-parton particle-specific fragmentation. For each particle, we determine the `enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluon fragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event. Thus defined, an enhancement of 1.0 implies equal per-event production in both gluon and quark fragmentation.

We use the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain some general properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution of purely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purely poloidal fields. We also analyze energy conservation in Hall instabilities and write down a variational principle for Hall equilibria. We show that the evolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by Burgers' equation, as previously found in plane-parallel geometry. It leads to sharp current sheets that dissipate on the Hall time scale, yielding a stationary field configuration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. This field, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as their field lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilities earlier found numerically.

Takayama et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 061107 (2005)], the triangular lattice of triangular air holes may allow to achieve a complete photonic band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. In this work we present a systematic theoretical study of this photonic lattice in a high-index membrane, and a comparison with the conventional triangular lattice of circular holes, by means of the guided-mode expansion method whose detailed formulation is described here. Photonic mode dispersion below and above the light line, gap maps, and intrinsic diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes are calculated for the periodic lattice as well as for line- and point-defects defined therein. The main results are summarized as follows: (i) the triangular lattice of triangular holes does indeed have a complete photonic band gap for the fundamental guided mode, but the useful region is generally limited by the presence of second-order waveguide modes; (ii) the lattice may support the usual photonic band gap for even modes (quasi-TE polarization) and several band gaps for odd modes (quasi-TM polarization), which could be tuned in order to achieve doubly-resonant frequency conversion between an even mode at the fundamental frequency and an odd mode at the second-harmonic frequency; (iii) diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes in the triangular lattices with circular and triangular holes, and in line-defect waveguides or point-defect cavities based on these geometries, are comparable.

Comparing to a variety of semi-analytic models in which quenching is primarily driven by halo mass considerations or secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our model and different broad classes of models make unique and robust qualitative predictions for a number of observables, including the red fraction as a function of galaxy and halo mass, the density of passive galaxies and evolution of the color-morphology-density relations at high z, and the fraction of disky/boxy spheroids as a function of mass. In each case, the observations favor a model in which galaxies quench after a major merger builds a massive spheroid, and disfavor quenching via secular or pure halo processes. We discuss a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching, and propose a mixed scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, massive halos is supplemented by the feedback associated with star formation and quasar activity in a major merger, which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the conditions of a dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host, even in low mass halos.

In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng statistics.

We gathered IRAC images in multiple wavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty in relative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger than the photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place 2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths. At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to the photon counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is in phase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of 0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it must recirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the 1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation). If the planet has a small Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M_J (1-sigma). We do not detect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following 2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to its edge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, with appropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on the recirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere. HD 209458b must recirculate at least 32% of incident stellar energy to its night side, at the 1-sigma level, which is consistent with other constraints on recirculation from the depth of secondary eclipse depth at 8 micron and the low optical albedo.

The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region. The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer near the dust disk.

We find that small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to imperfections in the background subtraction.

To possess this large symmetry a dynamical model for excited hadrons, presumably a string model, should explain formation of chiral multiplets and, at the same time, predict coinciding slopes of the angular and radial Regge trajectories. This is possible only if both the dynamics of the string and the chirality of the quarks at the ends of the string are considered together. We construct a model-independent unitary transformation from the relativistic chiral basis to the ^{2S+1}L_J basis, commonly used in hadronic phenomenology as well as in the string models, and demonstrate that a hadron belonging to the given chiral representation is a fixed superposition of the basis vectors with different L's and S's. Thus the description of highly excited hadron in terms of a fixed L is not compatible with chiral symmetry and has to be disregarded in favour of the description in terms of the total hadron spin J.

This paper is the beginning of a project aimed at such a numerical implementation. The primary observational data from our past light cone consists of galaxy redshifts, apparent luminosities, angular diameters and number densities, together with source evolution functions, absolute luminosities, true diameters and masses of sources. Here we start with the simplest case, that of spherical symmetry and a dust equation of state, and execute an algorithm that determines the unknown metric functions from this data. We discuss the challenges of turning the theoretical algorithm into a workable numerical procedure, particularly addressing the origin and the maximum in the area distance. Our numerical method is tested with several artificial data sets for homogeneous and inhomogeneous models, successfully reproducing the original models.

No significant spectral evolution is observed from this phase to the follow-up phase, and the follow-up phase is usually consistent with the external shock models, implying that this segment likely due to a refreshed external shock.

Among the 13 bursts that have well-sampled optical light curves, 6 have an optical break around t_b and the breaks are consistent with being achromatic. However, the other 7 bursts either do not show an optical break or have a break at a different epoch than t_b. This raises a concern to the energy injection scenario, suggesting that the optical and X-ray emissions may not be the same component at least for a fraction of bursts. There are 4 significant outliers in the sample, and this shallow decau phase in these bursts is immediately followed by a very steep decay after t_b, which is inconsistent with any external shock model.

While the quoted paper deals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we investigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought to evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star, from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core collapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a function of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the number and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs, Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our simulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption components, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time scales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the beginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is expected to be one order of magnitude larger.

We take into account various selection effects due to the use of a magnitude limited sample. To determine linking length scaling we study the luminosity-density relation in observed groups. We follow the changes in group sizes and mean galaxy number densities within groups when shifting nearby groups to larger distances. As a result we show that the linking length should be a slowly growing function with distance.

We are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster Ap stars with the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages. In this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as it currently stands.   We select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably (1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic Ap stars. For the stars in this subsample we determine the fundamental parameters T_eff, log(L/L_o), and M/M_o. With these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age and fractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). For this purpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.   Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the TAMS. Statistically for the stars with M > 3 M_o the fields decline with advancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together with increased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a time scale of about 3 10^7 yr. In contrast, lower mass stars show no compelling evidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.   Study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtaining constraints on evolution of Ap stars through the main sequence. Enlarging the sample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise RMS fields, will help to clarify the results obtained so far. Further field observations are in progress.

Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red quasars are adopted.

In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered two-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane and Mele as an example. The nonperturbative definition of a topological insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edge states, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In this definition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case. Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that the direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.

Second, the external periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are both turned on.

A new R~1700 spectrum of the T7.5 dwarf HD 3651B, with existing data, allows a detailed comparison to the well-studied and very similar dwarf, Gl 570D. We find that HD 3651B has both higher gravity and metallicity than Gl 570D, with Teff=820-830K, log g= 5.4-5.5, [m/H]= +0.2 and Kzz=10^4cm^2/s.

The pivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition probability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula, discusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's knowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper discusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion based on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion theory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with subjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion function and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a rate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting condition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information for lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding. By analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and digitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective information is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there is an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the matching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing probability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of images or too much objective information is wasteful.

The existence of such domains is known in the theory of critical phenomena. The behavior of the resistance obtained here is compared to a recent experiment.

We constrain a mass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is simply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of Ly-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can also be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The inferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum. We find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters from 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26, and 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty cycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative luminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore, Ly-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~ 0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of Ly-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. We find no evidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of Ly-alpha emitters discovered in the current Ly-alpha surveys, including recent discovery of one Ly-alpha emitter at z=7. The data are consistent with no evolution of intrinsic properties of Ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium up to z=7.

In the high-Tc superconductors, a partial gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above Tc. A key question is whether the gap in the DOS above Tc is associated with pairing, and what determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-Tc superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values (hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in nanoscale regions above Tc. These regions proliferate as the temperature is lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing gap develops locally at a temperature Tp, following the relation 2D/kBTp = 8. At very low doping (<0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron pairing.

{"prompt": "A sufficient condition for Gaussian departure in turbulence", "human_text": "  The interaction of two isotropic turbulent fields of equal integral scale but different kinetic energy generates the simplest kind of inhomogeneous turbulent field. In this paper we present a numerical experiment where two time decaying isotropic fields of kinetic energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ initially match over a narrow region. Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic tangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The anisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is observed. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of the energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to the maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is obtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$. A field with $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ represents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very small velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly quiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a value equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width. The experiment shows that the presence of a turbulent energy gradient is sufficient for the appearance of intermittency and that during the mixing process the pressure transport is not negligible with respect to the turbulent velocity transport.

We confirm our previous results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions. Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M > 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun.

The single-cycle propagation equations in the temporal domain including higher-order nonlinear terms are presented. The balance between the quadratic (SHG) and the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity plays a crucial role: we define an effective soliton number -- related to the difference between the SHG and the Kerr soliton numbers -- and show that it has to be larger than unity for successful pulse compression to take place. This requires that the phase mismatch be below a critical level, which is high in a material where the quadratic nonlinearity dominates over the cubic Kerr nonlinearity. Through extensive numerical simulations we find dimensionless scaling laws, expressed through the effective soliton number, which control the behaviour of the compressed pulses. These laws hold in the stationary regime, in which group-velocity mismatch effects are small, and they are similar to the ones observed for fiber soliton compressors. The numerical simulations indicate that clean compressed pulses below two optical cycles can be achieved in a $\\beta$-barium borate crystal at appropriate wavelengths, even for picosecond input pulses.

{"prompt": "High-Speed Cylindrical Collapse of Two Perfect Fluids", "human_text": "  In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically distributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases, i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of two fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used, the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and consequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation of the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.

The weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of background galaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation of a high-resolution parameter-free mass map. The strongly-lensed objects tightly constrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale, breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. The mass reconstruction of Cl 0024+17 obtained in such a way is remarkable. It reveals a ringlike dark matter substructure at r~75\" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50\". We interpret this peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sight collision of two massive clusters 1-2 Gyr ago. Such an event is also indicated by the cluster velocity distribution. Our numerical simulation with purely collisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise by radially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised the pre-collision cores. Cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1E0657-56, but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. In addition, we show that the long-standing mass discrepancy for Cl 0024+17 between X-ray and lensing can be resolved by treating the cluster X-ray emission as coming from a superposition of two X-ray systems. The cluster's unusual X-ray surface brightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supports this hypothesis.

As stated in numerous quantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs to a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations.

First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional MCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al.

In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation.

We investigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those of different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of commonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average properties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows, in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results of photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV background. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density cannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex density structure for the absorber.

While there is no evidence for a red sequence at z~3, there does appear to be a well-defined color-magnitude relation (CMR) for blue galaxies at all redshifts, with more luminous galaxies having redder U-V colors. The slope of the blue CMR is independent of redshift d(U-V)/dMV = -0.09 (0.01) and can be explained by a correlation of dust-reddening with luminosity. The average color at fixed luminosity reddens strongly \\Delta(U-V) = 0.75 from z~3 to z=0, much of which can be attributed to aging of the stars. The color scatter of the blue sequence is relatively small sigma(U-V) = 0.25 (0.03) and constant to z~3, but notably asymmetrical with a sharp blue ridge and a wing towards redder colors. We explore sets of star formation histories to study the constraints placed by the shape of the scatter at z=2-3. One particular set of models, episodic star formation, reproduces the detailed properties very well. For a two-state model with high and low star formation, the duty cycle is constrained to be > 40% and the contrast between the states must be a factor > 5 (or a scatter in log(SFR) of > 0.35 dex around the mean).

Previous models of Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis, that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1 pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

This paper considers the effects on network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the load or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied. Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a special 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which information-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT.

We show that for many practical purposes, the implementation of quantum walks can be efficiently achieved using a classical computer. We then develop both classical and quantum graph isomorphism algorithms based on discrete-time quantum walks.

The scheme is based on the calculation of the mean force in m.d. simulations in which the height of a chosen molecule above the surface is constrained, and subsequent integration of the mean force to obtain the potential of mean force and hence the chemical potential. The scheme is valid at any coverage and temperature, so that in principle it allows the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of coverage and temperature. It avoids all statistical mechanical approximations, except for the use of classical statistical mechanics for the nuclei, and assumes nothing in advance about the adsorption sites. From the chemical potential, the absolute desorption rate of the molecules can be computed, provided the equilibration rate on the surface is faster than the desorption rate. We apply the theory by {\\em ab initio} m.d. simulation to the case of H$_2$O on MgO (001) in the low-coverage limit, using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of exchange-correlation.

Our goal is to investigate the nature of the near-UV light in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon, and the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge and central black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of the objects and characterize the near-UV emission.

In addition, the circumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution of the stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. The size of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions.

Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest.

The progenitor suffered an LBV-like outburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key evidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum source fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d after peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding SN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by extremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced X-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this object was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most peculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment created by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.

In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of breathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1, and finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry analysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in the last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which have an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are determined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base. Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a four-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear, Monge-Ampere type equation.   Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS description of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which ensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle shrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional base. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a smooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the base. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an S^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including topology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from the base.

While, at 10000 K, the bulky gas would absorb Lyman lines fully, at 50000K it emits superradiant lines. As superradiance de-excites the atoms strongly, nearly all available energy is emitted in a few competing modes: Superradiance appears only for beams which cross the largest column densities; for an observation from Earth, these beams generate three elliptical hollow cylinders whose bases are the observed rings; admitting that the Earth is not in a privileged direction, these cylinders envelope ellipsoidal shells observed, for the external rings, by photon echoes. For the equatorial ring, the brightness of the superradiant beams is multiplied by a quasi-resonant induced scattering of the rays emitted by the star. The de-excitation of atoms by emitted beams cools the gas strongly, so that ionization decreases fast, the process self accelerates. The energy of the high radiance rays from the star is strongly scattered to the ring while the low radiance of the glow which surrounds the star is rather amplified. The fast absorption of the radial beams produces the radial decrease of radiance of the ring while a competition of modes produces the pearls.

Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that is, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process along the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure.

We show that the IR emission from the majority of ULIRGs is powered mostly by star formation, with only ~20% of ULIRGs hosting an AGN with a comparable or greater IR luminosity than the starburst. The detection of the 14.32um [NeV] line in just under half the sample however implies that an AGN contributes significantly to the mid-IR flux in ~42% of ULIRGs. The emission line ratios, luminosities and PAH EWs are consistent with the starbursts and AGN in ULIRGs being more extincted, and for the starbursts more compact, versions of those in lower luminosity systems. The excitations and electron densities in the NLRs of ULIRGs appear comparable to those of lower luminosity starbursts, though there is evidence that the NLR gas in ULIRGs is more dense. We show that the combined luminosity of the 12.81um [NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines correlates with both IR luminosity and the luminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use this to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate. Finally, we show that ULIRGs with 0.8 < S_sil < 2.4 are likely to be powered mainly by star formation, but that ULIRGs with S_sil < 0.8, and possibly those with S_sil > 2.4, contain an IR-luminous AGN.

Entering a stellar atmosphere, PBH is supposed to produce the gamma-ray burst due to accretion with duration from a few tenths of second to a few seconds.

We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions.

The viscous stress driving the accretion is intimately connected to the microscopic processes of turbulence dissipation. We show that, in a few well-observed black hole accretion systems, there is compelling observational evidence of efficient electron heating by turbulence or collective plasma effects in low accretion states, when Coulomb collisions are not efficient enough to establish a thermal equilibrium between electrons and ions at small radii. However, charged particles reach a thermal equilibrium with their kind much faster than with others through Coulomb collisions, a two-temperature accretion flow is expected. We consider a Keplerian accretion flow with a constant mass accretion rate in the pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential and take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and inverse Comptonization cooling processes. The critical mass accretion rate, below which the two-temperature solution may exist, is determined by the cooling processes and the collisional energy exchanges between electrons and ions and has very weak dependence on the collision-less heating of electrons by turbulence, which becomes more important at lower accretion rates. Collision-less heating of electrons by MHD turbulence can no longer be ignored in quantitative investigations of these systems.

New marginal central limit theorems (CLT's) are established for these estimators, assuming the existence of four moments for the measurement errors and that the explanatory variables are in the domain of attraction of the normal law. The latter condition for the explanatory variables is used the first time, and is so far the most general in this context. It is also optimal, or nearly optimal, for our CLT's. Moreover, due to the obtained CLT's being in Studentized and self-normalized forms to begin with, they are a priori nearly, or completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the joint distribution of the error and explanatory variables. Consequently, they lead to a variety of readily available, or easily derivable, large-sample approximate confidence intervals (CI's) for the slope and intercept. In contrast, in related CLT's in the literature so far, the variances of the limiting normal distributions, in general, are complicated and depend on various, typically unknown, moments of the error and explanatory variables.

The new simulations follow evolution of the CR distribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing a better examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. The postshock CR pressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolution of the CR partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variable is self-similar. The shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length of the highest energy CRs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time, independent of diffusion model, so long as CRs continue to be accelerated to ever-higher energies. This means the nonlinear shock structure can be described approximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is the shock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptotic state. As before, the shock Mach number is the key parameter determining the evolution and the CR acceleration efficiency, although finite Alfven wave drift and wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effective velocity change experienced by CRs, so reduce acceleration efficiency noticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderate Mach numbers.

{"prompt": "A Derivation of Einstein Gravity without the Axiom of Choice: Topology\n  Hidden in GR", "human_text": "  A derivation of the equations of motion of general relativity is presented that does not invoke the Axiom of Choice, but requires the explicit construction of a choice function q for continuous three-space regions. The motivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background independence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that both the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are derived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations of motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and distinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to derive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a three-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically appropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a three-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space regions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q. These solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the topology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity. Q is given by 2T^3+3S^1xS^2, and is embedded in four dimensions. This points toward a hidden topological content for general relativity, best phrased as: Q and q provide a structure for how to choose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has, while at the same time Q and q determine that only GR can endow a three-space with those geometric properties. In this sense, avoiding the Axiom of Choice allows one to gain physical insight into GR. Possible links with holography are pointed out.

It turns out that the structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for L-alanine in water as compared to crystal. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that the generally accepted approach of extending the structural information acquired from crystallographic data to a L-alanine molecule in aqueous solution should be used with caution.

{"prompt": "The influence of horizontal gene transfer on the mean fitness of\n  unicellular populations in static environments", "human_text": "  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that conjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the mutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of unicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection balance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of antibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive. We analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high antibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest mean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of conjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and then rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation becomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean fitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the mean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges we have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due to the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the antibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the behavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations. The results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly deleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection balance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing for faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this paper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by environmental stresses on a population.

In this paper we investigate the effects of a time delay in the feedback for a protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass velocity. For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with increasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the system with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed closed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart provided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian ratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large delays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve the performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the maximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is the result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several (multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called threshold protocol.

The reason for that is twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux. Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the four-neutrino model parameter space.

We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops, the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08. We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.

Here we show that these stars most likely lost their envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in general.

Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance that stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such events can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion activity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal disruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By numerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone we determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic advance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlarging the loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted stars should grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the cluster mean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act against the eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption events to be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in which the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre advance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored.

The velocity distribution function was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the auroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model parameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which must be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\\parallel} = 0$), with a full-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector orientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between 10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This range encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths. We find excellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and observed AKR intensities assuming convective growth length $L_c\\approx$20-40 km and group speed 0.15$c$. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible observed LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100 times the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities. This implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI mechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We find that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary waves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4.

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the \"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into the environment) stages as a function of n_thr.

Our approach contains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class 0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations.

Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the low metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 um emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellar populations, in agreement with previous findings.

The low radio flux emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between `hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate).

Here we present an improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies. Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD.

J. Hannan, 1961/1962 for general canonical correlations of stochastic processes. The spectral theory of selfadjoint operators is used to investigate the properties of the angles, e.g., to establish connections between the angles corresponding to orthogonal complements. The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are characterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant subspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the polar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors. Point angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles corresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former subspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter subspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff distance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces, is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.

I resolve this dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three nonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function (PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson. The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.

These AGN inflate buoyant bubbles containing non-thermal radio emitting particles. If such bubbles efficiently confine cosmic rays (CR) then this could explain ``radio ghosts'' seen far from cluster centers. We simulate the diffusion of cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our simulations include the effects of the anisotropic particle diffusion introduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray morphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic draping effect. We conclude that for such magnetic field topologies, a substantial fraction of cosmic rays can be confined inside the bubbles on buoyant rise timescales even when the parallel diffusivity coefficient is very large. For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak out of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations. Thus, the long confinement times associated with the magnetic suppression of CR diffusion can explain the presence of radio ghosts. We show that the partial escape of cosmic rays is mostly confined to the wake of the rising bubbles, and speculate that this effect could: (1) account for the excitation of the H$\\alpha$ filaments trailing behind the bubbles in the Perseus cluster, (2) inject entropy into the metal enriched material being lifted by the bubbles and, thus, help to displace it permanently from the cluster center and (3) produce observable $\\gamma$-rays via the interaction of the diffusing cosmic rays with the thermal intracluster medium (ICM).

Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network. Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important. A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this approach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes, called \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a problem in this scheme.

Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3 days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the long-period radial velocity variation.

Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics. As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also display the largest chemotactic response.

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches.

Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we apply this approach to both the 3-year WMAP data and simulated future data. WMAP data constrain two principal components of the reionization history, approximately corresponding to the total optical depth and the difference between the contributions to the optical depth at high and low redshifts. The optical depth is consistent with the constraint found in previous analyses of WMAP data that assume instantaneous reionization, with only slightly larger uncertainty due to the expanded set of models.

We show how the arrival and departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be broadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately describe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k buffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time, and we give results for both single and multi-source message streams. We define coverage rate as peer-messages per unit time, i.e. the rate at which a number of peers receive messages, and show that the coverage rate is limited by the churn rate and buffer size.

Using the IME model, and assuming random processes, we have obtained very accurate equations of the system dynamics in a variety of interesting cases, that allow us to tune a peer-to-peer system.

We define the photometric central time of the transit that is equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the barycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact value of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of the satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a reliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and the mass of the exomoon.

This task is facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on the NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian} which, being a \\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support} one for (q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field approximation and with an emphasis on the \\emph{order parameter} and the ``\\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises' statistics and spectrum.

This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern. They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change are applied.

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed.

We compare this sample to lower redshift samples of quasars observed inthe submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ((sub)mm), and find that the distribution of the FIR to B band optical luminosity ratio (L_FIR/L_B) is similar from z~2 to 6. We find a weak correlation between the FIR luminosity (L_FIR) and B band optical luminosity (L_B) byincluding the (sub)mm observed samples at all redshifts. Some strong (sub)mm detections in the z~6 sample have radio-to-FIR ratios within the range defined by star forming galaxies, which suggests possible co-eval star forming activity with the powerful AGN in these sources. We calculate the rest frame radio to optical ratios (R*_1.4=L_{v, 1.4GHz}/L_{v, 4400A}) for all of the VLA observed sources in the z~6 quasar sample. Only one radio detection in this sample, J083643.85+005453.3, has R*_1.4~40 and can be considered radio loud. There are no strong radio sources (R*_1.4>=100) among these SDSS quasars at z~6.

However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate the multicanonical temperature effectively. Wang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of states based on a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. In their method, the density of states is calculated autonomously during a simulation. In this paper we develop a set of techniques to effectively apply the Wang-Landau method to MD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of the density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we devise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of states is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short canonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative, which is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram technique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides, Met-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD is consistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformational space.

{"prompt": "Evolution of Phase-Space Density in Dark Matter Halos", "human_text": "  The evolution of the phase-space density profile in dark matter (DM) halos is investigated by means of constrained simulations, designed to control the merging history of a given DM halo. Halos evolve through a series of quiescent phases of a slow accretion intermitted by violent events of major mergers. In the quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follows the NFW profile and the phase-space density profile, Q(r), is given by the Taylor & Navarro power law, r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9 and stays remarkably stable over the Hubble time. Expressing the phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r)=Qs (r/Rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of Q is determined by Qs. We have found that the effective mass surface density within Rs, Sigma_s = rhos Rs, remains constant throughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main branch of its merging tree. This invariance entails that Qs ~ Rs^{-5/2} and Q(r) ~ Sigma_s^{-1/2} Rs^{-5/2} (r/ Rs)^{-beta}. It follows that the phase-space density remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const., in the quiescent phases and it decreases as Rs^{-5/2} in the violent ones. The physical origin of the NFW density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown. Yet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations after the violent phases. The major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease discontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^{5/2} = const. The virial equilibrium in the quiescent phases implies that a DM halos evolves along a sequence of NFW profiles with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within Rs.

Some results suggest that the observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral collisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the constraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison allows us to rule out the case without transition.

The radius problem has been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall complexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the algorithm tree search. This reduction in the complexity is due to the ability of decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost 50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for hardware implementation.

The convective mode of instability, which is driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the accretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an amplifying global feedback loop.

However, new protein functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable future functional evolution.   RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change in one function based on the measurement of several others.

We measure three different types of spatial alignment: halo alignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and the distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the orientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the directions of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment: the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting line between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the orientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment between the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that satellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at least 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially point towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales but a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is weaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All velocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest that the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which extends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main contribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the satellite orientations in the group tidal field.

The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range 34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs, which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations. Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100 times the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational savings in certain applications.

In particular, the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS), the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]   Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.   We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies.

The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations perpendicular to high symmetry axes.

Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's dilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and the emergence of global oscillations.

We find that the UV lines are emitted from high density gas between the stars downstream of the reverse shock, while the optical lines are emitted downstream of the shock propagating outwards the system.

The key characteristic of the enhanced photonic-crystal cavity is that its Bloch dispersion relation displays a degenerate photonic band edge, rather than only regular ones. This can be realized in specially arranged stacks of misaligned anisotropic layers. On the down side, the presence of birefringent layers results in the Fabry-Perot resonance being coupled only with one (elliptic) polarization component of the incident wave, while the other polarization component is reflected back to space. In this paper we show how a small modification of the periodic layered array can solve the above fundamental problem and provide a perfect impedance match regardless of the incident wave polarization, while preserving the giant transmission resonance, characteristic of a degenerate photonic band edge.

We show that, for lines that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al. hint at just such a change in slope.

In this work we provide a new and independent lower limit for the WDM particle mass (e.g. sterile neutrino) through the analysis of image fluxes in gravitationally lensed QSOs.   Starting from a theoretical unperturbed cusp configuration we analyze the effects of intergalactic haloes in modifying the fluxes of QSO multiple images, giving rise to the so-called anomalous flux ratio. We found that the global effect of such haloes strongly depends on their mass/abundance ratio and it is maximized for haloes in the mass range $10^6-10^8 \\Msun$.   This result opens up a new possibility to constrain CDM predictions on small scales and test different warm candidates, since free streaming of warm dark matter particles can considerably dampen the matter power spectrum in this mass range. As a consequence, while a ($\\Lambda$)CDM model is able to produce flux anomalies at a level similar to those observed, a WDM model, with an insufficiently massive particle, fails to reproduce the observational evidences.   Our analysis suggests a lower limit of a few keV ($m_{\\nu} \\sim 10$) for the mass of warm dark matter candidates in the form of a sterile neutrino.

We exhibit new difficulties in both cases, and point out the hidden fine tuning of some models. On the other hand, we show that several published no-go theorems are based on hypotheses which may be unnecessary, so that the space of possible models is a priori larger.

However, the analysis of the field equations within matter (a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature) exhibits a deadly problem, namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic. Incidentally, we prove that the same theoretical framework provides a stable and well-posed model able to reproduce the Pioneer anomaly without spoiling any of the precision tests of general relativity. Our conclusion is that all MOND-like models proposed in the literature, including the new ones examined in this paper, present serious difficulties: Not only they are unnaturally fine tuned, but they also fail to reproduce some experimental facts or are unstable or inconsistent as field theories.

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for the three cases.

First, we analyze the helix-coil phase transition for polypeptides and proteins, and describe an quasi unfolding transition (like the cold denaturation process) for the degree of helicity (the order parameter for macromolecules). Next we consider the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on the square, Husimi and hexagon lattices. Using the method of dynamical mapping, the magnetization curves with plateaus, bifurcation point and one period doubling are obtained. Then we investigate the model with cubic symmetry defined on the Bethe lattice and containing both linear and quadratic spin-spin interactions. The magnetization of the system is calculated, and a complex structure of the phase transitions between the disordered, partially ordered and completely ordered states is observed.

We present here an on-going project aiming at a better description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar evolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a first step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash. Using stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have computed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration region during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these results, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of the circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell.

The second step of the project deals with the dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we are computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars.

A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones.

This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels.

We also briefly address the influence of the choice of gauge, and of the initial and final electronic bound states on such patterns. For the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional terms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one hand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron initially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of the features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order to reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed electronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the velocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the interference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an alternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an additional attosecond-pulse train.

The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+ confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal support.

Thus this is an ideal method to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for (for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational configurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid solvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension of these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high order convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational grids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically fourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same order for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in the evolution.   Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accurate solutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatial dimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in three spatial dimensions with {\\it Robin} outer boundary conditions. We demonstrate a ``real world'' 3-dimensional problem which is the solution of the conformally flat Hamiltonian constraint of General Relativity. The success of this method depends on: a) the choice of the discretization near the holes; b) the definition of the location of the inner boundary, which allows resolution of the hole even on the coarsest grids; and on maintaining the same order of convergence at the boundaries as in the interior of the computational domain.

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1) through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2) through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of relativistic electrons.   RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of ambient magnetic field strength.

In fact, up to now a few different scenarios for acceleration of particles inside open clusters have been considered, i.e. shocks in massive star winds, pulsars and their nebulae, supernova shocks, massive compact binaries. Here we consider in detail the radiation processes due to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As a specific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising in the winds of WR type stars. Particles diffuse through the medium of the open cluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by the age of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at first inside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. We calculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example open clusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observational constraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that the high energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-ray energies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likely description of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in the hybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the TeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense clouds surrounding the open cluster.

Until recently, there was some controversy on the proper definition of conserved charges in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This paper provides a systematic and explicit Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and the angular momenta of both asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any dimension D bigger or equal to 4. This requires as a first step a precise determination of the asymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum. These conditions happen to be achieved in ellipsoidal coordinates adapted to the rotating solutions.The asymptotic symmetry algebra is found to be isomorphic either to the Poincare algebra or to the so(D-1, 2) algebra, as expected. In the asymptotically flat case, the boundary conditions involve a generalization of the parity conditions, introduced by Regge and Teitelboim, which are necessary to make the angular momenta finite.

We propose that the latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible. One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to identify the G\\\"odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this incompleteness.

The instrument for hard X-rays HXD/PIN allows us a detection of the source up to 50 keV. The broad-band continuum (0.5-50 keV) can be well modeled with a power-law with slope Gamma=1.5 (definitively softer than the continuum measured by XMM-Newton) above 1 keV with strong deficit of soft photons. The low-energy cut-off can be well fitted either with intrinsic absorption (with column density N_H~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar rest frame) or with a break in the continuum, with an extremely hard (Gamma =0.7) power-law below 1 keV. We construct the Spectral Energy Distribution of the source, using also optical-UV measurements obtained through a quasi-simultaneous UVOT/SWIFT observation. The shape of the SED is similar to that of other Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for the detection in gamma-rays by GLAST. We model the SED with the synchrotron-Inverse Compton model usually applied to FSRQs, showing that the deficit of soft photons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of the spectrum near the low energy end of the IC component rather than to intrinsic absorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out.

In the classical limit, it exhibits two kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet, which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

The calculation entails a post-Newtonian expansion within the framework of second order perturbation theory, wherein we consider the effects of subhorizon density perturbations in a flat, dust dominated universe. Within this formalism, we calculate luminosity distances and redshifts along the past light cone of an observer. The resulting luminosity distance-redshift relation is fit to that of a homogeneous model in order to deduce the best-fit cosmological constant density Omega_Lambda. We find that the luminosity distance-redshift relation is indeed modified, by a small fraction of order 10^{-5}. When fitting this perturbed relation to that of a homogeneous universe, we find that the inferred cosmological constant can be surprisingly large, depending on the range of redshifts sampled. For a sample of supernovae extending from z=0.02 out to z=0.15, we find that Omega_Lambda=0.004. The value of Omega_Lambda has a large variance, and its magnitude tends to get larger for smaller redshifts, implying that precision measurements from nearby supernova data will require taking this effect into account.

Moreover, the reversal phenomena are observed in this system based on the numerical experiments in the one-dimensional space. As an explanation, we regard it as the effect of periodic forces. Thus, we give qualitative explanations to how reversal phenomena stably appear, which seem to arise from the mixing function of the periodic force and the noise.

This model is based on generalized stochastic processes leading to the Tsallis statistics. The equilibrium states correspond to polytropic configurations similar to gaseous polytropes in astrophysics. For the critical index n_3=d/(d-2) (where d is the dimension of space), the theory of polytropes leads to a unique value of the mass M_c that we interpret as a limiting mass. In d=3, we find M_c=202.8956... and in d=2, we recover the well-known result M_c=8 pi (in suitable units). For M<M_c, the system evaporates (in an infinite domain) or tends to an equilibrium state (for box-confined configurations). For M>M_c, the system collapses and forms a Dirac peak containing a mass M_c surrounded by a halo. This paper exposes the model and shows, by simple considerations, the origin of the critical mass.

Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors, Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam, OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed) would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality.

Upon that, random diversity of the structural space abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law. The separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for real proteins.

The question of how and where does this complex world-line arise is one of the two main subjects of this work. The other subject concerns what is known in the mathematical literature as a CR structure. In GR, CR structures naturally appear in the physical context of shear-free (or asymptotically shear-free) null geodesic congruences in space-time. For us, the CR structure is associated with the embedding of Penrose's real three-dimensional null infinity, I^+, as a surface in a two complex dimensional space, C^2. It is this embedding, via a complex function, (a CR function), that is our other area of interest. Specifically we are interested in the `decomposition' of the CR function into its real and imaginary parts and the physical information contained in this decomposition.

The ideal constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This calls into question the validity of the constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits. Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the solution.

Accurate photometry (especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond the standard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spread function (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities than aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibration factor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type, exposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sample includes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, on backgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. The coarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) and is based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70 micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F, respectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from two stars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all time scales probed.

Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic intervals.

It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone. This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals. Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates enhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including distortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result of two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to the changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to the increase of Tc.

Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest that in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes must necessarily be very short.

{"prompt": "Two-dimensional defect modes in optically induced photonic lattices", "human_text": "  In this article, localized linear defect modes due to bandgap guidance in two-dimensional photonic lattices with localized or non-localized defects are investigated theoretically. First, when the defect is localized and weak, eigenvalues of defect modes bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived analytically. It is shown that in an attractive (repulsive) defect, defect modes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal (anomalous) diffraction coefficients. Furthermore, distances between defect-mode eigenvalues and Bloch-band edges are exponentially small functions of the defect strength, which is very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances are quadratically small with the defect strength. It is also found that some defect-mode branches bifurcate not from Bloch-band edges, but from quasi-edge points within Bloch bands, which is very unusual. Second, when the defect is localized but strong, defect modes are determined numerically. It is shown that both the repulsive and attractive defects can support various types of defect modes such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole, and vortex modes. These modes reside in various bandgaps of the photonic lattice. As the defect strength increases, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher ones when the defect is repulsive, but remain within each bandgap when the defect is attractive, similar to the one-dimensional case. The same phenomena are observed when the defect is held fixed while the applied dc field (which controls the lattice potential) increases. Lastly, if the defect is non-localized (i.e. it persists at large distances in the lattice), it is shown that defect modes can be embedded inside the continuous spectrum, and they can bifurcate out from edges of the continuous spectrum algebraically rather than exponentially.

However, the pressure profiles obtained from in-situ particle measurements by the high-altitude satellites do not allow tracking the pressure variations related to the storms and substorms, because a time interval needed to do this generally exceeds the characteristic times of them. On contrary, fast movement of low-altitude satellites makes it possible to retrieve quasi-instantaneous profiles of plasma pressure along the satellite trajectory, using the fluxes of precipitating particles. For this study, we used the Aureol-3 satellite data for plasma pressure estimation, and the IGRF, Tsyganenko 2001 and Tsyganenko 2004 storm time geomagnetic field models for the pressure mapping into the equatorial plane. It was found that during quiet geomagnetic condition the radial pressure profiles obtained coincide with the profiles, obtained previously from the high-altitude measurements. On the contrary, it was found that during geomagnetic storm the plasma pressure profiles became sharper; the position of the maximum of plasma pressure corresponds to expected one for given Dst minimum; the maximum value of inner magnetosphere static pressure correlates with the solar wind dynamic pressure.

The mass rearing of M.dorsiplana was carried out in a population cage where the density of egg-laying females per infested seed was increased from 1:1 on the first day to 5:1 on the last (fifth) day. Under these experimental conditions egg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs laid also increased. The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio which tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex ratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters). The mean weight of adults emerging from a parasitized host was negatively correlated with the egg-clutch size, i.e., as egg-clutch size increased, adult weight decreased.

An analysis of these data shows that the cluster distribution is in good agreement with the thick, inclined disk geometry of the LMC, as defined by its field stars. We also find that the old globular clusters follow the same distribution, suggesting that the LMC's disk formed at about the same time as the globular clusters, ~ 13 Gyr ago. Finally, we have used our cluster distances in conjunction with the disk geometry to calculate the distance to the LMC center, for which we find (m-M)o = 18.40 +/- 0.04_{ran} +/- 0.08_{sys}, or Do = 47.9 +/- 0.9 +/- 1.8 kpc.

Meshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element methods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh primitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly updates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The performance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.   This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh update has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory parameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a $d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where $M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers. The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller caches, where $M=o(B^d)$.   The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts. The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation and with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\\log^2(|G|/M)/B)$ memory transfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|/B)(\\log^2(|G|/M) + \\log|G|))$ memory transfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine (DAM) models.

The photometric data indicate that the spot coverage of the K dwarf component was less than observed in the past, suggesting that we monitored the star close to a minimum in its activity cycle.

We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction field), gives the next to leading order evolution.

The X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s and t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14) and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy. Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7. We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase.

{"prompt": "Almost Product Evaluation of Hankel Determinants", "human_text": "  An extensive literature exists describing various techniques for the evaluation of Hankel determinants. The prevailing methods such as Dodgson condensation, continued fraction expansion, LU decomposition, all produce product formulas when they are applicable. We mention the classic case of the Hankel determinants with binomial entries ${3k+2 \\choose k}$ and those with entries ${3k \\choose k}$; both of these classes of Hankel determinants have product form evaluations. The intermediate case, ${3k+1 \\choose k}$ has not been evaluated. There is a good reason for this: these latter determinants do not have product form evaluations.   In this paper we evaluate the Hankel determinant of ${3k+1 \\choose k}$. The evaluation is a sum of a small number of products, an almost product.   The method actually provides more, and as applications, we present the salient points for the evaluation of a number of other Hankel determinants with polynomial entries, along with product and almost product form evaluations at special points.

These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that \"in-phase\" oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size. These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.

In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies are preferentially located along the major axis.

The X-ray observation was performed with the High Resolution Camera on board of the Chandra X-ray Observatory, allowing us to derive the most accurate position for this source (alpha = 21h43m3.38s, delta= +6deg54'17\".53; 90% uncertainty of 0.\"6). Furthermore, we confirmed with a higher spatial accuracy the point-like nature of this X-ray source. Optical and infrared observations were taken in B, V, r', i', J, H and Ks filters using the Keck, VLT, Blanco and Magellan telescopes, while radio observations were obtained from the ATNF Parkes single dish at 2.9GHz and 708MHz. No plausible optical and/or infrared counterpart for RBS 1774 was detected within the refined sub-arsecond Chandra X-ray error circle. Present upper limits to the optical and infrared magnitudes are r'>25.7 and J>22.6 (5 sigma confidence level). Radio observations did not show evidence for radio pulsations down to a luminosity at 1.4 GHz of L < 0.02 mJy kpc^2, the deepest limit up to date for any XDINS, and lower than what expected for the majority of radio pulsars. We can hence conclude that, if RBS 1774 is active as radio pulsar, its non detection is more probably due to a geometrical bias rather than to a luminosity bias.

{"prompt": "Lyman Alpha Emitters in the Hierarchically Clustering Galaxy Formation", "human_text": "  We present a new theoretical model for the luminosity functions (LFs) of Lyman alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation. We extend a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation that reproduces a number of observations for local and high-z galaxies, without changing the original model parameters but introducing a physically-motivated modelling to describe the escape fraction of Lya photons from host galaxies (f_esc). Though a previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed a constant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc: extinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a star formation feedback. It is found that the new model nicely reproduces all the observed Lya LFs of the Lya emitters (LAEs) at different redshifts in z ~ 3-6. Especially, the rather surprisingly small evolution of the observed LAE Lya LFs compared with the dark halo mass function is naturally reproduced. Our model predicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in the observed LFs. This is also consistent with available observations, while the simple universal f_esc model requires f_esc << 1 not to overproduce the brightest LAEs. On the other hand, we found that our model significantly overpredicts LAEs at z > 6, and absorption of Lya photons by neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium (IGM) is a reasonable interpretation for the discrepancy. This indicates that the IGM neutral fraction x_HI rapidly evolves from x_HI << 1 at z < 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7, which is broadly consistent with other observational constraints on the reionization history.

For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to impose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a binary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture. Here we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the spatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is assumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric Keplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these objects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital element distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the circular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in the circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture mechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary mutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of retrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle transport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance in a chemical reaction. Implications for binary formation rates are considered and the 'fine-tuning' problem recently identified by Noll et al. (2007) is also addressed.

{"prompt": "Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr\n  spacetimes", "human_text": "  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
