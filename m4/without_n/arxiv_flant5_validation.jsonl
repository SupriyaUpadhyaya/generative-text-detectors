If this is the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is confirmed.

We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1 tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments strongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in several members of the TMTTF family.

In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure. Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic labeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well predefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore, the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step for building future advanced intersection safety systems ", "machine_text": "The paper presents a new approach to risk assessment based on recursive neural networks.

However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold dark matter budget.

Such isolated galaxy samples have up to now been small or poorly defined. The AMIGA project (Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies) represents an attempt to define a statistically useful sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local (z < 0.05) Universe. A suitable large sample for the AMIGA project already exists, the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG, Karachentseva 1973; 1050 galaxies), and we use this sample as a starting point to refine and perform a better quantification of its isolation properties. Digitised POSS-I E images were analysed out to a minimum projected radius R > 0.5 Mpc around 950 CIG galaxies (those within Vr = 1500 km s-1 were excluded). We identified all galaxy candidates in each field brighter than B = 17.5 with a high degree of confidence using the LMORPHO software. We generated a catalogue of approximately 54 000 potential neighbours (redshifts exist for 30% of this sample). Six hundred sixty-six galaxies pass and two hundred eighty-four fail the original CIG isolation criterion. The available redshift data confirm that our catalogue involves a largely background population rather than physically associated neighbours. We find that the exclusion of neighbours within a factor of four in size around each CIG galaxy, employed in the original isolation criterion, corresponds to Delta Vr ~ 18000 km s-1 indicating that it was a conservative limit. Galaxies in the CIG have been found to show different degrees of isolation. We conclude that a quantitative measure of this is mandatory.

The maps of CO cover most of the optical disk of the galaxies. We investigated the influence of bar on the distribution of molecular gas in spiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of central concentration is higher in barred spirals than in non-barred spirals as shown by the previous works. Furthermore, we present an observational evidence that bars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar length toward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts of the disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of molecular gas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlation between the degree of central concentration and bar strength.

Their analysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. The Orion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of young low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP), an ~10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Aims. Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods. We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun), we establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray luminosity have very similar flare frequencies. Conclusions. Our observational results are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are entirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution; the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and form a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.

Several signatures were considered, involving hard jets, large missing energy, and either $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron or muon pairs, or top quarks reconstructed exploiting their fully hadronic decays. With only 1 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data each of these signatures may allow to observe an excess of events over Standard Model expectation with a statistical significance exceeding 5 standard deviations.

Heating, radiative transport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by solving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using a fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy balance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. As is also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is magnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-state is reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content fluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with no secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas pressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the approximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally increases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower than linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of two larger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the dissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the current density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass is proportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass column density to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. As in our earlier study of a gas-dominated shearing-box, we find that energy transport is completely dominated by radiative diffusion, with Poynting flux carrying less than 1% of the energy lost from the box.

While no detection is made neither in the orientation analysis nor in the elongation analysis, a strong detection is made in the excess kurtosis of the signed-intensity of the WMAP data. The non-Gaussianity is observed with a significance level below 0.5% at a wavelet scale corresponding to an angular size around 10 degrees, and confirmed at neighbour scales. This supports a previous detection of an excess of kurtosis in the wavelet coefficient of the WMAP data with the axisymmetric Mexican hat wavelet (Vielva et al. 2004). Instrumental noise and foreground emissions are not likely to be at the origin of the excess of kurtosis. Large-scale modulations of the CMB related to some unknown systematics are rejected as possible origins of the detection. The observed non-Gaussianity may therefore probably be imputed to the CMB itself, thereby questioning the basic inflationary scenario upon which the present concordance cosmological model relies.

The fraction of high radio loudness (R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core of the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is anti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated with R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x less radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in the SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This correlation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200 (K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio loudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that destroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.

The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays are below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical and X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent observations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a constant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model. Although radio observations do not support the constant density model for long bursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong. The most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to shock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would be expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor velocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for the termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly accomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary progenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.

Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary context, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic in a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and contracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or blue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a UV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne universe. On the other hand, the Milne universe is another coordinate systems of flat Minkowski space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should be the same (but vacuum-dependent) in different coordinates of flat space time. We explicitly demonstrate that in conventional QFT the energy momentum tensor, choosing the adiabatic vacuum, is identical to zero in Minkowski coordinates, and remains zero in the contracting Milne universe (due to non-trivial cancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating frame and from vacuum polarization there). In contrast to this, the trans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We provide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy momentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero.

The research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.   The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these jets.   The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to study merger properties and evolution directly because the identification of cluster mergers in observations is problematic. We use large N-body simulations to study the statistical properties of massive halo mergers, specifically investigating the utility of close halo pairs as proxies for mergers. We examine the relationship between pairs and mergers for a wide range of merger timescales, halo masses, and redshifts (0<z<1). We also quantify the utility of pairs in measuring merger bias. While pairs at very small separations will reliably merge, these constitute a small fraction of the total merger population. Thus, pairs do not provide a reliable direct proxy to the total merger population. We do find an intriguing universality in the relation between close pairs and mergers, which in principle could allow for an estimate of the statistical merger rate from the pair fraction within a scaled separation, but including the effects of redshift space distortions strongly degrades this relation. We find similar behavior for galaxy-mass halos, making our results applicable to field galaxy mergers at high redshift. We investigate how the halo merger rate can be statistically described by the halo mass function via the merger kernel (coagulation), finding an interesting environmental dependence of merging: halos within the mass resolution of our simulations merge less efficiently in overdense environments. Specifically, halo pairs with separations less than a few Mpc/h are more likely to merge in underdense environments; at larger separations, pairs are more likely to merge in overdense environments.

Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).   We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree (number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses. First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine their asymptotic values for large number of colors.   Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the relevant phenomenon.

One of the main contributors to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within modules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways or modules.

The abundances derived from collisionally excited lines also suffer some bias, although to a much lesser extent. In the absence of any recipe for correcting these biases, we recommend the discarding of all objects showing large ADFs from studies of galactic chemical evolution.

Measurement of dry sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal settings.

Second, we bring to light a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl number, with $\\alpha\\propto Pm^\\delta$ for the explored range: $0.12<Pm<8$ and $200<Re<6400$ ($\\delta$ being in the range 0.25 to 0.5).

Important issues concentrating on the difficult balance between relative system isolation when becoming complex and required delegation of corresponding new capability from (outside) operator are discussed. This implies giving the system some intelligence in an adequate frame between new augmented system state and supervising operator, with consequences on canonical system triplet {effector-sensor-controller} to be reorganized in this new setting.

This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity.

Conversely, if the approximation by products is good in this region, the zeta-function has at most finitely many zeros in it. We then construct a parameterized family of non-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of a finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family satisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large, they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are all simple, and they \"repel\". The structure of these functions makes the reason for the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a mechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the zeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions in the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for small values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them as the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function, the moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the zeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis. We end by discussing analogues for other L-functions and show how they give insight into the study of the distribution of zeros of linear combinations of L-functions.

Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a 10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition subcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the amplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period. Previously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change by supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to Io's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to include an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary variation that remains fixed in System III longitude.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis.

Here we describe a simple, physically realizable pattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the phase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a temperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control over the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front theory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.

To stabilize the modulus, we consider one-loop corrections to the effective potential by the Casimir effect. The one-loop effective potential for the volume modulus has a form which is very similar to Coleman-Weinberg potential. We evaluate coefficients appearing in the effective potential by employing zeta function regularization and heat kernel analysis. The volume modulus is stabilized for smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit angle of the reference brane. After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible to obtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scales and a tiny effective cosmological constant (though its sign is negative).

We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting. ", "machine_text": "We construct a class of dynamical objects for cohomologically expanding maps.

TeV observations of the distant blazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the infrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce, thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically. Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to the observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to a characteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divert the pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to the spectrum becomes negligible.

The associated power exponent can be simply related to the entropic exponent for which the q-entropy exhibits a constant rate of increase. This analysis leads to the definition of a new sensitive indicator distinguishing regular from weakly chaotic orbits, that we call `Average Power Law Exponent' (APLE).

Two mechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media influence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the network of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence, where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of interactions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing that cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media influence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action (direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of the full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that the enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media only occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous studies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in combination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural homogeneity.

For N tending to infinity, it reduces to the Vlasov equation describing collisionless systems. We describe the process of phase mixing and violent relaxation leading to the formation of a quasi stationary state (QSS) on the coarse-grained scale.

The B-DMFT is applicable for arbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the lattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the B-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending on whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein condensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be overcome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian itself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal footing and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It reproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the Beliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the existing mean-field theories of interacting bosons.

Linear tabling is a framework from which different methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This paper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies, and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally unacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an effective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid redundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the technique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization technique called {\\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.

{"prompt": "Co-orbital Oligarchy", "human_text": "  We present a systematic examination of the changes in semi-major axis caused by the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central star in the presence of eccentricity dissipation. For parameters relevant to the oligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical eccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact parameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each other; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the protoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise unperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less than a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between their neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the shear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding zones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets in the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that depends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma/\\sigma$. Early in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between rows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10 Hill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy the average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer solar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the inner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires more giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional evidence that Mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, but must be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.

The model is based on height-integrated hydrodynamic equations, alpha-viscosity, and a pseudo-Newtonian potential that results in an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) that closely approximates the one predicted by GR. We find that the hydrodynamic models exhibit increasing deviations from the standard disk model of Shakura & Sunyaev as disk thickness H/R or the value of alpha increases. The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque is assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results for attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to fit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in the spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At worst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a non-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. We also consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in the disk and that inside the ISCO. The contrast needs to be large if black hole spin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadened X-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off an accretion disk. In our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and thickness is low when H/R>0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may be most reliable in extemely thin disks.

Such a phenomenon is illustrated using an extended t--J model on a planar pyrochlore lattice for which the work on the quarter-filled case [cond-mat/0702367] is complemented and extended to 1/8- and 3/8-fillings. The location of the metal-insulator transition as a function of the Coulomb repulsion is shown to depend strongly on the sign of the hopping. Quite generally, the metal-insulator transition is characterized by lattice symmetry breaking but the nature of the insulating Mott state is more complex than a simple Charge Density Wave. Indeed, in the limit of large Coulomb repulsion, the physics can be described in the framework of (extended) quantum fully-packed loop or dimer models carrying extra spin degrees of freedom. Various diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions are computed and the low-energy spectra are analyzed in details in order to characterize the nature of the insulating phases. We provide evidence that, as for an electronic density of n=1/2 (quarter-filling), the system at $n=1/4$ or $n=3/4$ exhibits also plaquette order by forming a (lattice rotationally-invariant) Resonating-Singlet-Pair Crystal, although with a quadrupling of the lattice unit cell (instead of a doubling for $n=1/2$) and a 4-fold degenerate ground state.

In general, the individual systems cannot constrain halo models, in the sense that the data poorly constrains the stellar mass fraction of the halo. The ensemble of systems, however, strongly constrains the average stellar mass represented by the visible galaxies to $0.026\\pm0.006$ of the halo mass if we neglect adiabatic compression, rising to $0.056\\pm0.011$ of the halo mass if we include adiabatic compression.

We show that the soft excess is best described as originating from thermal Comptonization by plasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary X-ray emitting plasma; we find that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately by reflection from an ionized accretion disk.

We study this \"collisional\" evolutionary regime using both fully self-consistent N-body integrations and approximate Fokker-Planck models. The N-body integrations employ particle numbers up to 0.26M and a direct-summation potential solver; close interactions involving the binary are treated using a new implementation of the Mikkola-Aarseth chain regularization algorithm. Even at these large values of N, two-body scattering occurs at high enough rates in the simulations that they can not be simply scaled to the large-N regime of real galaxies. The Fokker-Planck model is used to bridge this gap; it includes, for the first time, binary-induced changes in the stellar density and potential. The Fokker-Planck model is shown to accurately reproduce the results of the N-body integrations, and is then extended to the much larger N regime of real galaxies. Analytic expressions are derived that accurately reproduce the time dependence of the binary semi-major axis as predicted by the Fokker-Planck model. Gravitational wave coalescence is shown to occur in <10 Gyr in nuclei with velocity dispersions below about 80 km/s.

The spectral fits have been done in count space and include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previously reported optical and X-ray temporal behaviour.

A statistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in this sample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigma level or greater, which has significant implications for particle acceleration models. This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburst density structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous) and k=2 (wind-like).

Solar models that use these new abundances are not consistent with helioseismological determinations of the sound speed profile, the surface helium abundance and the convection zone depth. Aims. We investigate the effect of changes of solar abundances on low degree p-mode and g-mode characteristics which are strong constraints of the solar core.

Low-degree small frequency spacings are very sensitive to changes in the heavy-element abundances, notably neon. We show that by considering all the seismic constraints, including the small frequency spacings, a rather large increase of neon abundance by about (0.5 +/- 0.05)dex can be a good solution to the discrepancy between solar models that use new abundances and low degree helioseismology, subject to adjusting slightly the solar age and the highest abundances.

We review the hardware, the calibration and imaging strategies, comparing them to those at higher frequencies, including aspects of interference excision and wide-field imaging. Ionospheric phase fluctuations pose the major difficulty in calibrating the array. Over restricted fields of view or at times of extremely quiescent ionospheric ``weather'', an angle-invariant calibration strategy can be used. In this approach a single phase correction is devised for each antenna, typically via self-calibration. Over larger fields of view or at times of more normal ionospheric ``weather'' when the ionospheric isoplanatic patch size is smaller than the field of view, we adopt a field-based strategy in which the phase correction depends upon location within the field of view.

The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.   Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic.

Using only the fgas data for the 6 lowest redshift clusters at z<0.15, for which dark energy has a negligible effect on the measurements, we measure Omega_m=0.28+-0.06 (68% confidence, using standard priors on the Hubble Constant, H_0, and mean baryon density, Omega_bh^2).

In particular, observational constraints are sparse, a consequence of the discrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches. To bring observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in binaries and multiple stars, we have been conducting two dedicated observing programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring. In this chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these two programs. A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT/NACO imaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of planets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU. On the radial-velocity side, current results confirm that the use of two-dimensional correlation allows to search for circumprimary giant planets in many types of spectroscopic binaries. Definitive results from our ongoing planet search in spectroscopic binaries should yield important constraints on the closest binaries susceptible of hosting circumprimary giant planets.

A diffusion approximation for selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life history matrices (and therefore, different growth rates and demographic variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual based simulations.

It is however well known that the dynamics of the magnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any attempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for magnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation of the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned coupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the question is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field can be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will be the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge of the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into the language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system considered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified one-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model retains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes equations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear response to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves. It is concluded that variational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though the velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the entire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed information on the magnetic field.

Prominent examples of difficult (that is, VNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are difficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these polynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that if the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the hamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in VP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded treewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this flavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect matchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in VP also. For general graphs this problem is VNP-complete. In this paper we investigate the expressive power of the above results.

NTT/EMMI long-slit spectroscopic observations of 11 S0 galaxies at z < 0.006 are used to measure the absorption-line indices, Hdelta, Hgamma, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335 within the central r_e/8. By inverting single-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities and alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount of fading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviation from the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar populations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading is consistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching of star formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation method for S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm that previous results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by the S_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or [NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is this emission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with the theory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed, possibly as a result of a change in environment. The on-going star formation in the youngest galaxies hints that the timescale of quenching is ~< 1 Gyr. We speculate, therefore, that the truncation of star formation is a rather gentle process unlikely to involve a rapid burst of star formation.

A Gaussian emission line is also included in the spectral model to represent the Fe Ka line at ~ 6.4 keV. The fitted temperatures of the two partially covered components are about 2 keV and 1 keV, while the uncovered component has a temperature of ~ 0.5-0.6 keV. The equivalent blackbody emission radius of the hottest component is the smallest and that of the coolest component is the biggest. During dips, the fluxes of the two hot components are linearly correlated, while that of the third component doesn't show any significant variation. The Fe line flux remains constant within errors during the short dips. However, during the long dips the line flux changes significantly and is positively correlated with the fluxes of the two hot components.

Individual HII regions may remain undetectable in forthcoming redshifted 21 cm experiments. However, the systematic deformation along the line of sight may be detectable statistically, either by stacking tomographic 21cm images of quasars identified, for example, by JWST, or as small-scale anisotropy in the three-dimensional 21cm power spectrum. Here we consider the detectability of this effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expand rapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages of reionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scales comparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx. 30 Mpc and below). The effect therefore cannot be ignored when analyzing future 21cm power spectra on small scales. If 10 percent of the volume of the IGM at redshift z=10 is ionized by quasars with typical ionizing luminosity of S= 5 x 10^{56} photons/second, the distortions can enhance by more than 10 percent the 21cm power spectrum in the radial (redshift) direction, relative to the transverse directions.

Here we present a census of disks for a sample of over 230 spectroscopically identified wTTs located in the c2d IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 4.8, and 8.0 um) and MIPS (24 um) maps of the Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Perseus Molecular Clouds. We find that ~20% of the wTTs in a magnitude limited subsample have noticeable IR-excesses at IRAC wavelengths indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk. The disk frequencies we find in these 3 regions are ~3-6 times larger than that recently found for a sample of 83 relatively isolated wTTs located, for the most part, outside the highest extinction regions covered by the c2d IRAC and MIPS maps. The disk fractions we find are more consistent with those obtained in recent Spitzer studies of wTTs in young clusters such as IC 348 and Tr 37. From their location in the H-R diagram, we find that, in our sample, the wTTs with excesses are among the younger part of the age distribution. Still, up to ~50% of the apparently youngest stars in the sample show no evidence of IR excess, suggesting that the circumstellar disks of a sizable fraction of pre-main-sequence stars dissipate in a timescale of ~1 Myr. We also find that none of the stars in our sample apparently older than ~10 Myrs have detectable circumstellar disks at wavelengths < 24 um. Also, we find that the wTTs disks in our sample exhibit a wide range of properties (SED morphology, inner radius, L_DISK/L*, etc) which bridge the gaps observed between the cTTs and the debris disk regimes.

Because of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion disc forms in the inner few parsec. The orientation of the disc performs a random walk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much faster than viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighter accretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R >> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of mass accretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g., when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be the central parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuring structures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) faster black hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black hole spin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy and momentum feedback in the galaxy bulge.

The range of variation is consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales.

We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with current data. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growth and geometry that is different from that of general relativity. Parameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space of such theories.

In the present work, we show from three dimensional calculations of sand transport that the size and the shape of the minimal barchan dune depend on the wind friction speed and the sand flux on the area between dunes in a field. Our results explain the common appearance of barchans a few tens of centimeter high which are observed along coasts. Furthermore, we find that the rate at which grains enter saltation on Mars is one order of magnitude higher than on Earth, and is relevant to correctly obtain the minimal dune size on Mars.

We demonstrate, for the first time, how gauge invariance can be maintained quite generally by averaging over Gribov copies. This allows us to extend the analysis of the Polyakov lines and the corresponding, gauge invariant quark-antiquark state to all distance scales.

This approach is based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions, or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior of the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and five-diagonal unitary matrices.   In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions. Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.   As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.

An automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science. Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been recently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a resolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected. In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut, which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q. Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore, using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut, to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the existing algorithms.

The resulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained in our earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling of gravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasing is adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similar to those from the power spectrum.

In their seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it cycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting for cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem, mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre which shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result also holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.   On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually solved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets (left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right normal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search problem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think that even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small right-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case of rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of a given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the isomorphism being defined using iterated cycling.

Its eruption resembled the well-known FU Orionis-type or EX Lupi-type outbursts. Since very few such events have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to study the temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with the Infrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering 20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and complemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We analysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed light curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy distributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime. According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent fading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed wavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates indicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The outburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer than that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest that OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to the recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy distribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I object, with an age of < 10^5 yr.

In the nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active - starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to 10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts.

In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for BICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based on this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design. We provide simulation results demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed distortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear detectors. We show that although these receivers have the same performance for perfect CSIT, their performance varies under imperfect CSIT.

We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray data available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant radio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a very tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations P_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our analysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with expectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field strength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H and sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In addition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial radius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the cluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus that the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.

In principle, the nature of an occurring spin-glass phase in such systems might be inferred from an analysis of the zero-temperature properties. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding ground-state configurations is a non-polynomial problem computationally, such that efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two dimensions. We analyze bulk properties such as the asymptotic ground-state energy and the phase diagram of disorder strength vs. disorder concentration. For the case of a symmetric distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, we find that the ground state of the model is unique up to a global O(2) rotation of the spins. In particular, there are no extensive degeneracies in this model. The main focus of this work is on an investigation of the excitation spectrum as probed by changing the boundary conditions. Using appropriate finite-size scaling techniques, we consistently determine the stiffness of spin and chiral domain walls and the corresponding fractal dimensions.

The ratio of magnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be small (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial collapse significantly.

We freeze the spacetime metric (\"Cowling approximation\") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the black hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of magnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of matter due to shock heating. When magnetic fields are present, the field lines gradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. MHD shocks and the MRI generate MHD turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the central black hole. When the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in the torus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodic accretion onto the hole.

Using Far-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous studies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight effects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction (radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes in lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common value, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of total-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each cloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V.

The present data cannot conclusively differentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2 formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several clouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The scatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with the characteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds.

The\n  IR-Through-UV Curve Morphology", "human_text": "  We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328 Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened \"standard\" stars. This technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sightline.

Starting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they are successively divided on the basis of their polarity/hydrophobic index, with increasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of subdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme based on physical/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain mobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the chemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter, the total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different degree of similarity between amino acids.

It encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay (IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support (compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the space of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are precisely delimited.

We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies.

Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos. We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their star formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours. Also, the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows.

We demonstrate that the apparent differences in the luminosity distributions seen in samples selected from 430-MHz surveys can be explained by small-number statistics and observational selection biases. An examination of the sample from 1400-MHz surveys shows no differences in the distributions.

The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. The straggler identification problem has applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response.

{"prompt": "The impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei in cosmological\n  simulations: Formation of disk galaxies", "human_text": "  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

Particle interferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition to standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In this work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the propagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor experiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of decoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by means of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard (adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By assuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain (E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino mixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar nor KamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whose characteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained.

The results of these simulations are used first to test the current analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smooth accretion limit. When the unmodified profile is taken directly from simulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results of our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good approximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the simulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy amplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In the second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating simulations to recent observations.

However -- as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the simulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular, while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large radius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can simultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels.

For the no accretion case, we consider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass resides in the dust Friedmann universe.

This cosmological correction may be interpreted in an analogy with the radiation from a moving mirror in a flat spacetime. For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer solution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the cosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is apparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole of which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment.

We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N high enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We find a CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely radio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call Population A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s) sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The systematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is not observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B. We find new correlations between FWHM(CIV 1549 BC) and CIV 1549 line shift as well as the equivalent width of CIV 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. CIV 1549 measures enhance the apparent dichotomy at FWHM(Hbeta BC) approx. 4000 \\kms\\ (Sulentic et al. 2000) suggesting that it has more significance in the context of Broad Line Region structure than the more commonly discussed RL vs. RQ dichotomy. Black hole masses computed from FWHM CIV 1549 BC for about 80 AGN indicate that the CIV 1549 width is a poor virial estimator. Comparison of mass estimates derived from Hbeta BC and CIV 1549 reveals that the latter show different and nonlinear offsets for population A and B sources.

Attention is given to the approach toward the hard-sphere limit, and to the effect of density and temperature on the strength of the depletion potential. Our results indicate, surprisingly, that even a modest degree of softness in the pair potential governing the direct interactions between the particles may lead to a significantly more attractive total effective potential for the big spheres than in the hard-sphere case.

We interpret the high-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knots as shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss.

To test that statement a set of constrained N-body cosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scale structure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within the flat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrained simulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed for comparison.

Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiar velocities of halos.

In star-forming environments, enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of low-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment. Adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a choice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to include radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30 (Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10 K < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this density, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our method in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo. Using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star formation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the strongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up to 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar abundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of density and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a cooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable regions as the most inducive to fragmentation.

The catalog contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to 10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich. Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33 field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater than 99.9% confidence level.

Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite size scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D values of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but fixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take place without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of numerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\\alpha$ obtained by MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system.

We start by pointing out that entropy production is often hidden in traditional treatments of quantum-impurity models. We then use simple thermodynamic arguments to define the rate of entropy production. Using the scattering framework recently developed by the authors we show that the rate of entropy production has a simple information theoretic interpretation in terms of the Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of nonequilibrium distribution function.

As the cost and observing cadence for such a mission will be driven largely by the separation between the two spacecraft, it is critically important to design an occulter that can meet the observing goals while flying as close to the telescope as possible. In this paper, we explore this tradeoff between separation and occulter diameter. More specifically, we present a method for designing the shape of the outer edge of an occulter that is as small as possible and gives a shadow that is deep enough and large enough for a 4m telescope to survey the habitable zones of many stars for Earth-like planets. In particular, we show that in order for a 4m telescope to detect in broadband visible light a planet 0.06 arcseconds from a star shining $10^{10}$ times brighter than the planet requires a specially-shaped occulter 50m in diameter positioned about $72,000$ km in front of the telescope.

Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the state of a quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction.

We generalize previous results in this subject by discussing a twisted version of the Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov conjecture. This duality is shown to hold at the level of N-point correlation functions on the sphere topology, and connects tree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean version of the 2D black hole (x time) to correlation functions in a non-linear sigma-model in flat space but in presence of a tachyon wall potential and a linear dilaton. The dual CFT corresponds to the perturbed 2D quantum gravity coupled to c<1 matter (x time), where the operator that describes the tachyon-like potential can be seen as a n=2 momentum mode perturbation, while the usual sine-Liouville operator would correspond to the vortex sector n =1. We show how the sine-Liouville interaction term arises through a twisting of the marginal deformation introduced here, and discuss such 'twisting' as a non-trivial realization of the symmetries of the theory. After briefly reviewing the computation of correlation functions in sine-Liouville CFT, we give a precise prescription for computing correlation functions in the twisted model. To show the new version of the correspondence we make use of a formula recently proven by S. Ribault and J.

We demonstrate that both our ADR and energy release methods do not generate significant acoustic noise, as has been a problem with previous ADR-based schemes. We proceed to model aspects of the deflagration, particularly the role of buoyancy of the hot ash, and find that our methods are reasonably well-behaved with respect to numerical resolution. We show that if a detonation occurs in material swept up by the material ejected by the first rising bubble but gravitationally confined to the white dwarf (WD) surface (the GCD paradigm), the density structure of the WD at detonation is systematically correlated with the distance of the deflagration ignition point from the center of the star.

By comparing a discrete and a continuous version of the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does not alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber network on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying occupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is shown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated in the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the persistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the introduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the geometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational effects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion coefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a master curve.

Orbital free methods attempt to calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic potentials.

Based on theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a star cluster. In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without primordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution of star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the same processes by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star clusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii that is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a result, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be explained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it is possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a black-hole binary (comprised of stellar mass black holes) rather than a single massive black hole.

The annealing temperature $T$ of the mixture then is a continuous parameter that characterizes the different sets of substrates, shaping the deposition process. As the alloy undergoes an order-disorder phase transition at the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), the jamming and percolating properties of the dimers deposited over the substrate are subjected to non-trivial changes. These are reflected in a density-temperature phase diagram with three well-defined regions. We find that for $T < T^* = 1.22 T_{c}$ the occurrence of jamming prevents the onset of percolating clusters, while percolation is possible for $T > T^{*}$. Particular attention is focused close to $T^{*}$, where the interplay between jamming and percolation restricts fluctuations, forcing exponents seemingly different from the standard percolation universality class. By analogy with a thermal transition, we study the onset of percolation by using the {\\it temperature} (in this case, the substrate annealing temperature) as a control parameter.

Considering two different cluster ages (100 and 150 Myr), we selected cluster member candidates on the basis of their location in the (I,I-z) CMD relative to the isochrones, and estimated the contamination by foreground late-type field dwarfs using statistical arguments, infrared photometry and low-resolution optical spectroscopy. We find that our survey should contain about 57% of the cluster members in the 0.03-0.6 Mo mass range, including 30-40 brown dwarfs. The candidate's radial distribution presents evidence that mass segregation has already occured in the cluster. We took it into account to estimate the cluster mass function across the stellar/substellar boundary. We find that, between 0.03Mo and 0.6Mo, the cluster mass distribution does not depend much on its exact age, and is well represented by a single power-law, with an index alpha=0.69 +/- 0.15. Over the whole mass domain, from 0.03Mo to 3Mo, the mass function is better fitted by a log-normal function with m0=0.36 +/- 0.07Mo and sigma=0.58 +/- 0.06.

We find that unstable modes arise for velocity of the jet larger than the speed of the sound of the plasma and only modes with momenta smaller than a certain values are unstable. Moreover, for ultrarelativistic velocities of the jet the longitudinal mode becomes stable and the most unstable modes correspond to relative angles between the velocity of the jet and momentum of the collective mode larger than $\\sim \\pi/8$.

This kind of phase transition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research framework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the effective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first time, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections, \\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical level, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the same class of universality.

The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), but the fractional rms amplitude of the pulses decreased from 65 to 11 per cent, and their profile changed from being single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks. Similar changes have been observed from other magnetars in response to outbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June.

METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral analysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize its properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The remaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample (L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within the host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very critical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with L[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray luminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). This problem affects mostly absorbed AGN (~40% of type~2 AGN in the survey are elusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed AGN (8%). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs are elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most important reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical dilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical absorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2). Alternative hypotheses, like the presence of Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects or ``non-standard'' AGN (e.g. with alpha_OX<1 or with weak/absorbed Narrow Line Region) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presence in the sample of a few sources of these types.

If these nuclear operators are approximated by their one-body forms and expanded in the nucleon velocity through order |\\vec{p}|/M, where \\vec{p} and M are the nucleon momentum and mass, a set of seven multipole operators is obtained. Nuclear structure calculations are often performed in a basis of Slater determinants formed from harmonic oscillator orbitals, a choice that allows translational invariance to be preserved. Harmonic-oscillator single-particle matrix elements of the multipole operators can be evaluated analytically and expressed in terms of finite polynomials in q^2, where q is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer. While results for such matrix elements are available in tabular form, with certain restriction on quantum numbers, the task of determining the analytic form of a response function can still be quite tedious, requiring the folding of the tabulated matrix elements with the nuclear density matrix, and subsequent algebra to evaluate products of operators. Here we provide a Mathematica script for generating these matrix elements, which will allow users to carry out all such calculations by symbolic manipulation. This will eliminate the errors that may accompany hand calculations and speed the calculation of electroweak nuclear cross sections and rates. We illustrate the use of the new script by calculating the cross sections for charged- and neutral-current neutrino scattering in ^{12}C.

We find a large amount of substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinction across the projected face of the cluster. With this interpretation, we are able to construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is used to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. Fitting cluster profiles (King and EFF) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger than previous estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in this cluster exists. Using the optical spectra, we find that the age of M82F is 60-80 Myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physically associated with a large HII region that it is projected upon, both in agreement with previous studies. The reconstructed integral field maps show that that majority of the line emission comes from a nearby HII region.

Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo, with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass, when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by the largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align with the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for halos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a subhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces.

The transition is typically of second order at high temperature and changes to first order at low temperature; the end points of the second order line are tricritical points. This qualitative picture does not change even in the limit of a large magnetic field, although the magnetic field substantially suppresses the transition temperature at the van Hove filling.

In NMR, this assumption leads to the prediction that pi pulses do not refocus the dipolar coupling. However, NMR spin echo measurements in dipolar solids defy these conventional expectations when more than one pi pulse is used. Observed effects include a long tail in the CPMG echo train for short delays between pi pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the echo amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern for intermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments that set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We find that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse is sufficient to cause the effects. Exact numerical calculations, combined with average Hamiltonian theory, identify novel terms that are sensitive to parameters such as pulse phase, dipolar coupling, and system size.

We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which better model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their decision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the adversary.   Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible schedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are independent stochastic variables.

At low photon fluxes this behavior reflects the time and energy entanglement between the down-converted photons. However, two-photon interactions such as two-photon absorption (TPA) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) can exhibit such a behavior even at high power levels, as long as the final state (i.e. the atomic level in TPA, or the generated light in SFG) is narrowband enough. This behavior does not depend on the squeezing properties of the light, is insensitive to linear losses, and has potential applications. In this paper we describe analytically this behavior for travelling-wave down-conversion with continuous or pulsed pumping, both for high- and low-power regimes. For this we derive a quantum-mechanical expression for the down-converted amplitude generated by an arbitrary pump, and formulate operators that represent various two-photon interactions induced by broadband light.

A better determination of the lepton mixing angles will give stronger prediction for the CP-violating invariants in the lepton sector. These will be tested in the next generation experiments. Finally we compute the effect of non diagonal neutrino mass in \"l_i -> l_j gamma\" in SUSY theories with non trivial Quark-Lepton complementarity and a flavor symmetry.

The most common relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1 dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling. However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling exponents.

In the metallic state of a one-dimensional solid, Fermi-liquid theory breaks down and spin and charge degrees of freedom become separated.

The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons can be determined.

Previous studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretion disc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion rates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the estimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed line profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic computation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thickness and the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. We include all relativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, time dilation, gravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and the relative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish as the thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produce accretion disc images.

Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarified by comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation. The calculated spectra verify the quantum Monte-Carlo results for finite temperatures. The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface in the underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdoped region. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass and self-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persists even at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region because a van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that a kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region. The kink is shown to be caused by a mixing between the quasiparticle band and an excitation band with strong short-range antiferromagnetic correlations.

{"prompt": "The Origin of the Galaxy Mass-Metallicity Relation and Implications for\n  Galactic Outflows", "human_text": "  (Abridged) Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in combination with analytic modeling, we show that the galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) provides strong constraints on galactic outflows across cosmic time. We compare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model that emulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven wind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed z~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional simulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the MZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium metallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment balance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the dilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to Z_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass M_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its halo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below M_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model has M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this scale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with observations.

Unlike previous works, where a noiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in the current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.

We find that such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy spectra.

We describe the observational method used to identify the quasars and present optical, infrared, and millimeter photometry and optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We investigate the dust properties of these quasars finding an unusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminosity due to dust emission for another. The mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS quasars is substantially lower than that for SDSS quasars at the same redshift, likely due to a correlation with quasar UV luminosity. For two quasars with sufficiently high signal-to-noise optical spectra, we use the spectra to investigate the ionization state of hydrogen at z>5. For CFHQS J1509-1749 at z=6.12, we find significant evolution (beyond a simple extrapolation of lower redshift data) in the Gunn-Peterson optical depth at z>5.4.

At the lowest order in effective field theory, there are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons, we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does not change.

In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative volatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the crusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of an EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the formation of a plate tectonic system. The heat-producing elements, currently mainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation and evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental crusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ can not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water. For this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these planets. We also emphasize the influence of U and Th in EZ on the development and evolution of life on Earth. We propose that since the Earth and planets were born in a united solar system, there should be some common mechanisms to create the similarities and differences between them. We have tried to develop an integrated view to explain some problems in the tectonics of Earth and evolution, bio-evolution, and planetary dynamics through U and Th geochemistry. We believe that a comprehensive exploration on energy sources and their evolution is a good way to build bridges between different disciplines of science in order to better understand the Earth and planets.

{"prompt": "Bondi accretion in the early universe", "human_text": "  This paper presents a study of quasi-steady spherical accretion in the early Universe, before the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The main motivation is to derive the basic formulas that will be used in a companion paper to calculate the accretion luminosity of primordial black holes and their effect on the cosmic ionization history.   The following cosmological effects are investigated: the coupling of the gas to the CMB photon fluid (i.e., Compton drag), Hubble expansion, and the growth of the dark matter halo seeded by the gravitational potential of the central point mass. The gas equations of motion are solved assuming either a polytropic or an isothermal equation of state. We consider the cases in which the accreting object is a point mass or a spherical dark matter halo with power-law density profile, as predicted by the theory of \"secondary infall''. Analytical solutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are provided.   Different accretion regimes exist depending on the mass of the accreting object. If the black hole mass is smaller than 50-100 Msun, gas accretion is unaffected by Compton drag. A point mass and an extended dark halo of equal mass accrete at the same rate if M>5000 Msun, while smaller mass dark halos accrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass. For masses M>3 x 10^4 Msun, the viscous term due to the Hubble expansion becomes important and the assumption of quasi-steady flow fails. Hence, the steady Bondi solutions transition to the time-dependent self-similar solutions for \"cold cosmological infall\".

Evidence of multifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported [Ivanov et al., Nature {\\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character could be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability density functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale invariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart rate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In this paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance reported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy heartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating that the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent. Our work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of human heartbeat dynamics, which is shared by heart rate fluctuations in both healthy and pathological states.

At the boundaries we assume different reservoir densities which drive the system into a non-equilibrium steady state. As a model we use an one-dimensional two-component simple symmetric exclusion process with two different hopping rates $D_A,D_B$ and open boundaries. For investigating the dynamics in the hydrodynamic limit we derive a system of coupled non-linear diffusion equations for the coarse-grained particle densities. The relaxation of the initial density profile is analyzed by numerical integration. Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the self-diffusion coefficients, which turns out to be length-dependent, and for the stationary solution. In the steady state we find a discontinuous boundary-induced phase transition as the total exterior density gradient between the system boundaries is varied. At one boundary a boundary layer develops inside which the current flows against the local density gradient. Generically the width of the boundary layer and the bulk density profiles do not depend on the two hopping rates. At the phase transition line, however, the individual density profiles depend strongly on the ratio $D_A/D_B$. Dynamic Monte Carlo simulation confirm our theoretical predictions.

{"prompt": "Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the\n  R-mode Instability", "human_text": "  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached, the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution. Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway (timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude remains small $\\sim 10^{-5}$.

{"prompt": "Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed\n  Consensus", "human_text": "  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate, or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

{"prompt": "Lower order terms in the 1-level density for families of holomorphic\n  cuspidal newforms", "human_text": "  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior. We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections, depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

We present in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross section by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We compute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order of the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is calculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for this compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe that the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the spectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical spectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that scattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\\bf q} = (0,0)$ and ${\\bf q} = (\\pi,\\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid basis.
