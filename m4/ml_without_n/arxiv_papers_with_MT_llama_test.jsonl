The proposed algorithm also introduces a modification of similarity measure for patch comparison. The standard Euclidean norm is replaced by weighted Euclidean norm for patch based comparison. Assuming the patch as an oriented surface, notion of normal vector patch is being associated with each patch. The inner product of these normal vector patches is then used in weighted Euclidean distance of photometric patches as the weight factor. The algorithm involves two steps: The first step is multiscale implementation of an accelerated non-local means filtering in the stationary wavelet domain to obtain a refined version of the noisy patches for later comparison. This step is inspired by a preselection phase of finding similar patches in various non-local means approaches. The next step is to apply the modified non-local means filtering to the noisy image using the reference patches obtained in the first step. These refined patches contain less noise, and consequently the computation of normal vectors and partial derivatives is more accurate. Experimental results indicate equivalent or better performance of proposed algorithm as compared to various state of the art algorithms.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel multiscale hybrid non-local means filtering method that leverages a modified similarity measure to effectively address the limitations of traditional non-local means filtering approaches. By incorporating a novel multiscale framework, our method is capable of adaptively selecting the most relevant patches from the input image, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the filtering process. The modified similarity measure, which takes into account the spatial and frequency domain information, enables our method to effectively capture the underlying structure and patterns in the input image. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art non-local means filtering methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics, particularly in the presence of noise and complex textures. The proposed method is also computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-world applications. Our contributions lie in the development of a novel multiscale hybrid non-local means filtering method that combines the strengths of traditional non-local means filtering and multiscale analysis, thereby enabling the effective removal of noise and preservation of image details.

Gaussian priors are assigned to the signal coefficients given their state variables and the Jeffreys' noninformative prior is assigned to the noise variance. Our signal reconstruction scheme is based on an EM iteration that aims at maximizing the posterior distribution of the signal and its state variables given the noise variance. We construct the missing data for the EM iteration so that the complete-data posterior distribution corresponds to a hidden Markov tree (HMT) probabilistic graphical model that contains no loops and implement its maximization (M) step via a max-product algorithm. This EM algorithm estimates the vector of state variables as well as solves iteratively a linear system of equations to obtain the corresponding signal estimate.

The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how Sat can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and Skeptical Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. One cannot transform these two reasoning problems into SAT in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. We show that certain structural aspects of disjunctive logic programs can be utilized to break through this complexity barrier, using new techniques from Parameterized Complexity. In particular, we exhibit transformations from Brave and Skeptical Reasoning to SAT that run in time O(2^k n^2) where k is a structural parameter of the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is fixed-parameter tractable for parameter k. As the parameter k we take the size of a smallest backdoor with respect to the class of normal (i.e., disjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that when deleted makes the program normal. In consequence, the combinatorial explosion, which is expected when transforming a problem from the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy to the first level, can now be confined to the parameter k, while the running time of the reduction is polynomial in the input size n, where the order of the polynomial is independent of k.", "machine_text": "We introduce novel backdoors to normality for disjunctive logic programs, enabling the efficient computation of stable models in the presence of disjunctive rules.

The inference engine consists of three major components; a rule set memory, an inference processor, and a controller. In this implementation, a rule set memory is realized by a read only memory (ROM). The controller consists of two counters. In the inference processor, one data path is laid out for each rule. The number of the inference rule can be increased adding more data paths to the inference processor. All rules are executed in parallel, but each rule is processed serially. The logical structure of fuzzy inference proposed in the current paper maps nicely onto the VLSI structure. A two-phase nonoverlapping clocking scheme is used.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting codes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code used [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by encoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all three qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or Toffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit, in 63 ns. We find 85\\pm1% fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate and 78\\pm1% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction with 76\\pm0.5% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors.

In addition to being flexible in their ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are computationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large datasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches. Combining the kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation between disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental results: The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway wall area percentage measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals.

In this paper, we present an asymptotic generalization analysis of FLDA based on random matrix theory, in a setting where both $D$ and $N$ increase and $D/N\\longrightarrow\\gamma\\in[0,1)$. The obtained lower bound of the generalization discrimination power overcomes both limitations of the classical result, i.e., it is applicable when $D$ and $N$ are proportionally large and provides a quantitative description of the generalization ability of FLDA in terms of the ratio $\\gamma=D/N$ and the population discrimination power.

Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the axiomatic properties.

Our methodology combines graph-based and machine learning techniques to compute role similarity scores, which are then ranked using our axiomatic framework. The resulting ranking provides a meaningful and interpretable measure of node similarity, enabling the identification of nodes with similar functional roles and behaviors.

Specific angular momentum, lambda_R, correlates with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where cores are typically found in slow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. Cores are found only in massive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass M>8x10^10 Msun. Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar velocity dispersion within an effective radius, sigma_e, and specific angular momentum, where cores are found for lambda_R<0.25 and sigma_e>160 km/s. We estimate that only about 10% of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators with cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators could harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Core-less galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are under-luminous in the diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray luminosities. We postulate a possible population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which can not be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a genuine sub-population of slow rotators.

Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence.

This Regge Calculus (RC) is strikingly different from the more usual finite difference and finite element discretizations of gravity. In RC the fundamental principles of General Relativity are applied directly to a tessellated spacetime geometry. In this manuscript, and in the spirit of this conference, we reexamine the foundations of RC and emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay lattices play in this discrete theory. In particular we describe, for the first time, a geometric construction of the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This derivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements inherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric dual (Voronoi) lattice. The orthogonality properties between these two lattices yield an expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is strikingly similar to the corresponding and more familiar hinge-based expression in RC (deficit angle per unit Voronoi dual area). In particular, we show that the scalar curvature is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per weighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us is how naturally spacetime is represented by Voronoi and Delaunay structures and that the laws of gravity appear to be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less complexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is recovered by convergence in mean. Perhaps these prominent features may enable us to transcend the details of any particular discrete model gravitation and yield clues to help us discover how we may begin to quantize this fundamental interaction.", "machine_text": "We present a novel discrete representation of Einstein's geometric theory of gravitation, wherein we utilize dual tessellations to underpin Regge calculus.

Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to alleviate data sparseness of one domain using the knowledge about user preferences from other domains. A key question to be answered in the context of CDCF is what common characteristics can be deployed to link different domains for effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we assess the usefulness of user-contributed (social) tags in this respect. We do so by means of the Generalized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF) approach that we propose in this paper and that we developed based on the general collective matrix factorization framework. Assessment is done by a series of experiments, using publicly available CF datasets that represent three cross-domain cases, i.e., two two-domain cases and one three-domain case. A comparative analysis on two-domain cases involving GTagCDCF and several state-of-the-art CDCF approaches indicates the increased benefit of using social tags as representatives of explicit links between domains for CDCF as compared to the implicit links deployed by the existing CDCF methods. In addition, we show that users from different domains can already benefit from GTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we use the three-domain case to validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of datasets and the varying number of domains.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to cross-domain collaborative filtering (CF) that leverages social tags to bridge the gap between heterogeneous domains.

This approach is somewhat naive, especially for soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in Boolean Satisfiability (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to hold initially. When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of soft constraints that cannot hold simultaneously. Using this information the problem is relaxed to allow certain soft constraint(s) to be violated and solving continues. Since Lazy Clause Generation (LCG) solvers can also return unsatisfiable cores we can adapt the MAXSAT unsatisfiable core approach to CP. We implement the original MAXSAT unsatisfiable core solving algorithms WPM1, MSU3 in a state-of-the-art LCG solver and show that there exist problems which benefit from this hybrid approach.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the problem of identifying unsatisfiable cores in constraint programming, a fundamental challenge in solving constraint satisfaction problems.

Various static and dynamic quantities are computed and compared to results from simulations using Ewald summations. We find very good agreement for r_c ~ 10 Angstroms. For lower values of r_c, the long--range structure is affected which is accompanied by a slight acceleration of dynamic properties. In a second approach, the Coulomb interaction is replaced by an effective Yukawa interaction with two new parameters determined by a force fitting procedure. The same trend as for the Wolf method is seen. However, slightly larger cutoffs have to be used in order to obtain the same accuracy with respect to static and dynamic quantities as for the Wolf method.", "machine_text": "In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of amorphous silica, a critical material in various industrial applications.

CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a particular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus allowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear measurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the form of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging, video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by higher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is typically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be measured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced computational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two reconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method (GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker compressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both reconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing speed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the compression ratios may be worse than that offered by KCS.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel framework for compressive sensing of sparse tensors, addressing the pressing need for efficient and accurate recovery of high-dimensional data in various applications.

The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) allows computationally efficient feature selection based on linear dependency between input features and output values. In this paper, we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso for capturing non-linear input-output dependency. We first show that, with particular choices of kernel functions, non-redundant features with strong statistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-based independence measures. We then show that the globally optimal solution can be efficiently computed; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through feature selection experiments with thousands of features.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to high-dimensional feature selection, which we term feature-wise kernelized Lasso. Our method leverages the power of kernelization to effectively capture complex relationships between features, while simultaneously imposing sparsity on the feature space.

In this paper, we formulate this task as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a distributed inference framework in which the posterior distribution of labeling variable corresponding to each observation, conditioned on all history appearance and spatio-temporal evidence made in the whole networks, is calculated based solely on local information processing on each camera and mutual information exchanging between neighboring cameras. In our framework, the number of objects presenting in the monitored region, i.e. the sampling space of labeling variables, does not need to be specified beforehand. Instead, it can be determined automatically on the fly. In addition, we make no assumption about the appearance distribution of a single object, but use similarity scores between appearance pairs, given by advanced object re-identification algorithm, as appearance likelihood for inference. This feature makes our method very flexible and competitive when observing condition undergoes large changes across camera views. To cope with the problem of missing detection, which is critical for distributed inference, we consider an enlarged neighborhood of each camera during inference and use a mixture model to describe the higher order spatio-temporal constraints. The robustness of the algorithm against missing detection is improved at the cost of slightly increased computation and communication burden at each camera node.

At now, the defenders of the DTM still ignore the, though much better developed, studies of the \"traditional\"-Taylor-method users who, in turn, seem to ignore similarly the existence of the DTM. The DTM has been given an apparent strong formalization (set on the same footing as the Fourier, Laplace or Mellin transformations).

To provide a robust method for model selection, this paper introduces the Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm for Variable Selection (MOGA-VS) that provides the user with an optimal set of regression models for a given data-set. The algorithm considers the regression problem as a two objective task, and explores the Pareto-optimal (best subset) models by preferring those models over the other which have less number of regression coefficients and better goodness of fit. The model exploration can be performed based on in-sample or generalization error minimization. The model selection is proposed to be performed in two steps. First, we generate the frontier of Pareto-optimal regression models by eliminating the dominated models without any user intervention. Second, a decision making process is executed which allows the user to choose the most preferred model using visualisations and simple metrics.

The local strategy is based on matching individual salient facial SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. As for the global matching strategy, all SIFT features are combined together to form a single feature. In order to reduce the identification errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the two matching techniques.

The resulting sparse representations have been shown to possess robustness against a variety of distortions like random pixel corruption, occlusion and disguise. This approach however makes the restrictive (in many scenarios) assumption that test faces must be perfectly aligned (or registered) to the training data prior to classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet robust local block-based sparsity model, using adaptively-constructed dictionaries from local features in the training data, to overcome this misalignment problem. Our approach is inspired by human perception: we analyze a series of local discriminative features and combine them to arrive at the final classification decision. We propose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the conditional dependencies between these distinct sparse local features. In particular, we learn discriminative graphs on sparse representations obtained from distinct local slices of a face. Conditional correlations between these sparse features are first discovered (in the training phase), and subsequently exploited to bring about significant improvements in recognition rates. Experimental results obtained on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the presence of multiple registration errors (such as translation, rotation, and scaling) as well as under variations of pose and illumination.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel face recognition approach, which leverages discriminative local sparse representations to improve robustness against variations in pose, expression, and lighting.

Results analogous to those described in this paper have been derived before [Geiger, Verma, and Pearl 89, Shachter 88] but the implications for reducing complexity of the computations in Bayesian networks have not been stated explicitly. We show how a preprocessing step can be used to prune a Bayesian network prior to using standard algorithms to solve a given problem instance. We also show how our results can be used in a parallel distributed implementation in order to achieve greater savings. We define a computationally equivalent subgraph of a Bayesian network. The algorithm developed in [Geiger, Verma, and Pearl 89] is modified to construct the subgraphs described in this paper with O(e) complexity, where e is the number of edges in the Bayesian network. Finally, we define a minimal computationally equivalent subgraph and prove that the subgraphs described are minimal.", "machine_text": "We address the challenge of efficiently computing Bayesian networks (BNs) with a large number of variables and complex dependencies.

In this paper, we establish conditions ensuring exact recovery of the densest k cliques of a given graph from the optimal solution of a particular semidefinite program. In particular, the semidefinite relaxation is exact for input graphs corresponding to data consisting of k large, distinct clusters and a smaller number of outliers.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of SimpLearn through extensive experiments on various datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results have significant implications for the development of efficient and effective algorithms for topological data analysis, and we believe that SimpLearn has the potential to become a standard tool in the field.

In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires only going through the training data once without storing the entire training dataset, where conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second order statistics of training data in memory, resulting a storage requirement independent from the size of training data. To efficiently handle high dimensional data, we develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance matrices by low rank matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel one-pass AUC optimization framework that addresses the challenges of optimizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in machine learning. Our approach leverages a novel combination of gradient-based optimization and probabilistic modeling to iteratively refine the model's parameters and optimize the AUC in a single pass. By leveraging the probabilistic nature of the AUC, we demonstrate significant improvements in AUC optimization speed and accuracy compared to existing methods. Our framework is particularly effective in scenarios where AUC optimization is critical, such as in medical diagnosis, credit risk assessment, and recommender systems. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in AUC optimization.

Existing CPD methods use alternating least square (ALS) iterations and hence need to unfold tensors to each of the $N$ modes frequently, which is one major bottleneck of efficiency for large-scale data and especially when $N$ is large. To overcome this problem, in this paper we proposed a new CPD method which converts the original $N$th ($N>3$) order tensor to a 3rd-order tensor first. Then the full CPD is realized by decomposing this mode reduced tensor followed by a Khatri-Rao product projection procedure. This way is quite efficient as unfolding to each of the $N$ modes are avoided, and dimensionality reduction can also be easily incorporated to further improve the efficiency. We show that, under mild conditions, any $N$th-order CPD can be converted into a 3rd-order case but without destroying the essential uniqueness, and theoretically gives the same results as direct $N$-way CPD methods. Simulations show that, compared with state-of-the-art CPD methods, the proposed method is more efficient and escape from local solutions more easily.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to accelerate the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) algorithm, a widely used technique in multilinear algebra. By leveraging mode reduction, we develop an efficient method to reduce the computational complexity of CPD, enabling its application to larger datasets.

To overcome the computational difficulty, rank is often replaced with nuclear norm. For several rank minimization problems, such a replacement has been theoretically proven to be valid, i.e., the solution to nuclear norm minimization problem is also the solution to rank minimization problem. Although it is easy to believe that such a replacement may not always be valid, no concrete example has ever been found. We argue that such a validity checking cannot be done by numerical computation and show, by analyzing the noiseless latent low rank representation (LatLRR) model, that even for very simple rank minimization problems the validity may still break down. As a by-product, we find that the solution to the nuclear norm minimization formulation of LatLRR is non-unique. Hence the results of LatLRR reported in the literature may be questionable.", "machine_text": "We provide a counterexample to the validity of using the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate of rank, challenging a widely held assumption in the field of matrix completion.

Our methodology involves designing a pair of matrices with carefully chosen structures, leveraging the properties of matrix multiplication and the behavior of the nuclear norm. By analyzing the constructed matrices, we demonstrate that the nuclear norm does not accurately capture the rank of the matrix difference, highlighting the limitations of this convex relaxation. Our findings have significant implications for the development of efficient algorithms for matrix completion and low-rank approximation, underscoring the need for alternative methods that better account for the rank structure of the matrices.

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other.

We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation.

First, we provide a definition of causal dependence in decision-analytic terms, which we derive from consequences of causal dependence cited in the literature. Using this definition, we show how causal dependence can be represented within an influence diagram. In particular, we identify two inadequacies of an ordinary influence diagram as a representation for cause. We introduce a special class of influence diagrams, called causal influence diagrams, which corrects one of these problems, and identify situations where the other inadequacy can be eliminated.

In this paper, emphasis is placed upon the motivation of the theory. The central part of this motivation is established through an example involving a knowledge-based system. In order to evaluate combination of evidence for this system, using observed data, auxiliary at tribute and diagnosis variables, and inference rules connecting them, one must first choose an appropriate algebraic logic description pair (ALDP): a formal language or syntax followed by a compatible logic or semantic evaluation (or model). Three common choices- for this highly non-unique choice - are briefly discussed, the logics being Classical Logic, Fuzzy Logic, and Probability Logic. In all three,the key operator representing implication for the inference rules is interpreted as the often-used disjunction of a negation (b => a) = (b'v a), for any events a,b.   However, another reasonable interpretation of the implication operator is through the familiar form of probabilistic conditioning. But, it can be shown - quite surprisingly - that the ALDP corresponding to Probability Logic cannot be used as a rigorous basis for this interpretation! To fill this gap, a new ALDP is constructed consisting of \"conditional objects\", extending ordinary Probability Logic, and compatible with the desired conditional probability interpretation of inference rules. It is shown also that this choice of ALDP leads to feasible computations for the combination of evidence evaluation in the example.

Automatic recognition of human face based on facial expression can be an important component of natural human-machine interface. It may also be used in behavioural science. Although human can recognize the face practically without any effort, but reliable face recognition by machine is a challenge. This paper presents a new approach for recognizing the face of a person considering the expressions of the same human face at different instances of time. This methodology is developed combining Eigenface method for feature extraction and modified k-Means clustering for identification of the human face.

In this paper, we propose and compare two task-independent, generic behaviour similarity measures: combined state count and sampled average state. The proposed measures use the values of sensors and effectors recorded for each individual robot of the swarm. The characterisation of the group-level behaviour is then obtained by combining the sensor-effector values from all the robots. We evaluate the proposed measures in an aggregation task and in a resource sharing task. We show that the generic measures match the performance of domain dependent measures in terms of solution quality.

That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the inference task considered here is \"vertex classification\". However, we do not observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \\in {{V}\\choose{2}}$ we observe an \"edge-feature\" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus we errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\\widetilde{G} = (V,\\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\\widetilde{E}$ arise from the classifications of the \"edge-features\", and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality tradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task.

Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights. Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another (behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental, linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces, prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms, and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems.", "machine_text": "We introduce Off-Policy Actor-Critic, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem of off-policy evaluation and learning in reinforcement learning.

For practical viral marketing on large scale social networks, it is required that influence maximization algorithms should have both guaranteed accuracy and high scalability. However, existing algorithms suffer a scalability-accuracy dilemma: conventional greedy algorithms guarantee the accuracy with expensive computation, while the scalable heuristic algorithms suffer from unstable accuracy.   In this paper, we focus on solving this scalability-accuracy dilemma. We point out that the essential reason of the dilemma is the surprising fact that the submodularity, a key requirement of the objective function for a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimum, is not guaranteed in all conventional greedy algorithms in the literature of influence maximization. Therefore a greedy algorithm has to afford a huge number of Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the pain caused by unguaranteed submodularity. Motivated by this critical finding, we propose a static greedy algorithm, named StaticGreedy, to strictly guarantee the submodularity of influence spread function during the seed selection process. The proposed algorithm makes the computational expense dramatically reduced by two orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we propose a dynamical update strategy which can speed up the StaticGreedy algorithm by 2-7 times on large scale social networks.", "machine_text": "We propose StaticGreedy, a novel influence maximization algorithm that resolves the scalability-accuracy dilemma in large-scale social networks.

Essentially, orthogonality avoids, on the one side, the inherent ambiguity of non determinism, prohibiting the existence of different rules that specify the same function and that may apply simultaneously (non-ambiguity), and, on the other side, it eliminates the possibility of occurrence of repetitions of variables in the left-hand side of these rules (left linearity). In the theory of term rewriting systems (TRSs) determinism is captured by the well-known property of confluence, that basically states that whenever different computations or simplifications from a term are possible, the computed answers should coincide. Although the proofs are technically elaborated, confluence is well-known to be a consequence of orthogonality. Thus, orthogonality is an important mathematical discipline intrinsic to the specification of recursive functions that is naturally applied in functional programming and specification. Starting from a formalization of the theory of TRSs in the proof assistant PVS, this work describes how confluence of orthogonal TRSs has been formalized, based on axiomatizations of properties of rules, positions and substitutions involved in parallel steps of reduction, in this proof assistant. Proofs for some similar but restricted properties such as the property of confluence of non-ambiguous and (left and right) linear TRSs have been fully formalized.", "machine_text": "We formalize the confluence of orthogonal rewriting systems, a long-standing open problem in theoretical computer science.

Our results have far-reaching implications for the study of rewriting systems, providing a foundation for the development of more efficient and robust algorithms for rewriting-based computations.

The edges between nodes are weighted based on the similarity between corresponding SIFT features, allowing us to capture the spatial relationships between features.

This general, non-martingale framework allows a market-maker to make directional bets on market trends whilst keeping under control her inventory risk. In order to achieve this, the marker-maker places non-symmetric limit orders that favour market orders to hit her bid (resp. ask) quotes if she expects that prices will go up (resp. down).   With this inventory-risk-aversion parameter, the market-maker has not only direct control on her inventory risk but she also has indirect control on the moments of her PNL distribution. Therefore, this parameter can be seen as a fine-tuning of the marker-maker's risk-reward profile.   In the case of a mean-reverting mid-price, we show numerically that the inventory-risk-aversion parameter gives the market-maker enough room to tailor her risk-reward profile, depending on her risk budgets in inventory and PNL distribution (especially variance, skewness, kurtosis and VaR). For example, when compared to the martingale benchmark, a market can choose to either increase her average PNL by more than 15% and carry a huge risk, on inventory and PNL, or either give up 5% of her benchmark PNL to increase her control on inventory and PNL, as well as increasing her Sharpe ratio by a factor bigger than 2.", "machine_text": "We investigate high-frequency market-making with inventory constraints and directional bets, a crucial problem in modern financial markets.

Given a set of noisy observations $Z_i=X_i+\\epsilon_i$, $i=1,...,n$, the goal is to design clusters associated with the law of $X_i$'s, with unknown density $f$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Since we observe a corrupted sample, a direct approach as the popular {\\it $k$-means} is not suitable in this case. In this paper, we propose a noisy $k$-means minimization, which is based on the $k$-means loss function and a deconvolution estimator of the density $f$. In particular, this approach suffers from the dependence on a bandwidth involved in the deconvolution kernel. Fast rates of convergence for the excess risk are proposed for a particular choice of the bandwidth, which depends on the smoothness of the density $f$.   Then, we turn out into the main issue of the paper: the data-driven choice of the bandwidth. We state an adaptive upper bound for a new selection rule, called ERC (Empirical Risk Comparison). This selection rule is based on the Lepski's principle, where empirical risks associated with different bandwidths are compared.

Most of the relevant literature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification applications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class in the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace spanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is easily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an algorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not been seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss why previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems. We then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR. Specifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches rather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via averaging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to form an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations within each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to misalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we evaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder Neural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on Gaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and ChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains considerably better and more robust performance than several previous state-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set identification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based encoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but leads to higher recognition rates.", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the problem of robust face recognition in the presence of occlusions, pose variations, and expression changes.

Based on this model, in this study we use block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) to find a sparse representation of a test face for recognition. BSBL is a recently proposed framework, which has many advantages over existing block-sparse-model based algorithms. Experimental results on the Extended Yale B, the AR and the CMU PIE face databases show that using BSBL can achieve better recognition rates and higher robustness than state-of-the-art algorithms in most cases.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel face recognition approach, Robust Face Recognition via Block Sparse Bayesian Learning, to tackle the challenging problem of recognizing faces in the presence of various types of corruption and occlusion. Our method leverages the block sparse Bayesian learning framework to learn robust face representations from noisy and incomplete data. By modeling the face images as block sparse signals, we effectively capture the underlying structure of face features and improve the robustness of the recognition system. The proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the proposed method can effectively handle face images with various types of corruption, including noise, blur, and occlusion, achieving an average recognition rate of 95.6%. The proposed approach is also computationally efficient, requiring only a few seconds to process a single face image. Overall, our method provides a robust and efficient face recognition solution for real-world applications. "}

However, service convenience and security have followed disjoint paths in LBSNs and users can misuse the offered features. The major threat for the service providers is that of fake check-ins. Users can easily manipulate the localization module of the underlying application and declare their presence in a counterfeit location. The incentives for these behaviors can be both earning monetary as well as virtual rewards. Therefore, while fake check-ins driven from the former motive can cause monetary losses, those aiming in virtual rewards are also harmful. In particular, they can significantly degrade the services offered from the LBSN providers (such as recommendations) or third parties using these data (e.g., urban planners).

In our model of the moon illusion, the sky is considered a spatially-contiguous and geometrically-smooth surface. When an object such as the moon breaks the contiguity of the surface, instead of perceiving the object as appearing through a hole in the surface, humans perceive an occlusion of the surface. Binocular vision dictates that the moon is distant, but this perception model contradicts our binocular vision, dictating that the moon is closer than the sky. To resolve the contradiction, the brain distorts the projections of the moon to increase the binocular disparity, which results in an increase in the perceived size of the moon. The degree of distortion depends upon the apparent distance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the condition of the sky. As the apparent distance to the sky decreases, the illusion becomes stronger. At the horizon, apparent distance to the sky is minimal, whereas at the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing difficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.", "machine_text": "We demonstrate that binocular disparity is a crucial factor in explaining the moon illusion.

To learn a union of subspaces from a collection of data, sets of signals in the collection that belong to the same subspace must be identified in order to obtain accurate estimates of the subspace structures present in the data. Recently, sparse recovery methods have been shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)--recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with L1-minimization, in this paper, we develop sufficient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide significant advantages over NN methods and the gap between the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the dataset is sparse.

However, the low positive predictive value of breast biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. Data mining algorithms could be used to help physicians in their decisions to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram image or to perform a short term follow-up examination instead. In this research paper data mining classification algorithms; Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are analyzed on mammographic masses data set. The purpose of this study is to increase the ability of physicians to determine the severity (benign or malignant) of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient,s age. The whole data set is divided for training the models and test them by the ratio of 70:30% respectively and the performances of classification algorithms are compared through three statistical measures; sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy. Accuracy of DT, ANN and SVM are 78.12%, 80.56% and 81.25% of test samples respectively.

Our results demonstrate that a combination of clinical and imaging features, including tumor size, shape, and margins, can accurately predict the severity of breast masses. Specifically, our models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.85, indicating high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that molecular biomarkers, such as estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also played a significant role in predicting tumor severity.

This model is used to show that, if belief functions are based on reasonably accurate sampling or observation of a sample space, then the beliefs and upper probabilities as computed according to DS theory cannot be interpreted as frequency ratios.

We model the changes in the template using a generative process. We introduce a new dynamical model for the template update using a random walk on the Riemannian manifold where the covariance descriptors lie in. This is done using log-transformed space of the manifold to free the constraints imposed inherently by positive semidefinite matrices. Modeling template variations and poses kinetics together in the state space enables us to jointly quantify the uncertainties relating to the kinematic states and the template in a principled way. Finally, the sequential inference of the posterior distribution of the kinematic states and the template is done using a particle filter. Our results shows that this principled approach can be robust to changes in illumination, poses and spatial affine transformation.

In this paper, a framework to non-parametrically obtain measures of entropy directly from data using operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by infinitely divisible kernels is presented. The entropy functionals, which bear resemblance with quantum entropies, are defined on positive definite matrices and satisfy similar axioms to those of Renyi's definition of entropy. Convergence of the proposed estimators follows from concentration results on the difference between the ordered spectrum of the Gram matrices and the integral operators associated to the population quantities.

This is achieved by finding a pixel transformation function, which maps the original image histogram to a new histogram with lower dynamic range. Next the contrast of the transformed image is enhanced so as to compensate for brightness loss that would arise from backlight dimming. The proposed approach relies on an accurate definition of the image distortion which takes into account both the pixel value differences and a model of the human visual system and is amenable to highly efficient hardware realization. Experimental results show that the histogram equalization for backlight scaling method results in about 45% power saving with an effective distortion rate of 5% and 65% power saving for a 20% distortion rate. This is significantly higher power savings compared to previously reported backlight dimming approaches.", "machine_text": "We propose HEBS, a novel histogram equalization method for backlight scaling in digital images.

The effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is determined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth communities and ability to scale with the size of the data. In this work, we provide three contributions. First, we show that a popular measure of accuracy known as the F1 score, which is between 0 and 1, with 1 being perfect detection, has an information lower bound is 0.5. We provide a trivial algorithm that produces communities with an F1 score of 0.5 for any graph! Somewhat surprisingly, we find that popular algorithms such as modularity optimization, BigClam and CESNA have F1 scores less than 0.5 for the popular IMDB graph. To rectify this, as the second contribution we propose a generative model for community formation, the sequential community graph, which is motivated by the formation of social networks. Third, motivated by our generative model, we propose the leader-follower algorithm (LFA). We prove that it recovers all communities for sequential community graphs by establishing a structural result that sequential community graphs are chordal. For a large number of popular social networks, it recovers communities with a much higher F1 score than other popular algorithms. For the IMDB graph, it obtains an F1 score of 0.81.

The results are compared with previous measurements and the predictions of a variety of Galactic reddening laws. We find that 1) The dust reddening map of Schlegel et al.

The present work contributes a number of novel properties of IPMs, which should contribute to making IPMs more widely used in practice, for instance in areas where $\\phi$-divergences are currently popular.

This shows that IPMs are essentially different from $\\phi$-divergences. Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs from finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence rates are analyzed. These estimators are shown to be easily computable, with better rates of convergence than estimators of $\\phi$-divergences. Third, a novel interpretation is provided for IPMs by relating them to binary classification, where it is shown that the IPM between class-conditional distributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary classifier. In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is proved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional distributions, measured in terms of an IPM.", "machine_text": "We investigate the relationship between integral probability metrics, phi-divergences, and binary classification, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing and comparing different loss functions used in machine learning. We establish a connection between the integral probability metrics and phi-divergences, demonstrating that the latter can be viewed as a special case of the former. This connection enables us to derive new results and insights into the properties of phi-divergences, which are crucial for understanding their behavior in binary classification problems. Our work addresses the problem of selecting an optimal loss function for a given classification task, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying probability distribution of the data. We employ a range of mathematical techniques, including functional analysis and optimization theory, to establish our results. Our findings have significant implications for the development of robust and efficient machine learning algorithms, enabling researchers to better understand the trade-offs between different loss functions and make informed decisions about their choice.

Rational decision making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete as well as some intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make decisions. In the theory of bounded rationality this decision is made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect and the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of semi-bounded rationality, signal processing is used to filter noise and outliers in the information and the correlation machine is applied to complete the missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions.", "machine_text": "We present a novel model for decision making, semi-bounded rationality, which addresses the long-standing issue of bounded rationality.

A seller has $k$ identical items for sale and is facing $n$ potential buyers (\"agents\") that are arriving sequentially. Each agent is interested in buying one item. Each agent's value for an item is an IID sample from some fixed distribution with support $[0,1]$. The seller offers a take-it-or-leave-it price to each arriving agent (possibly different for different agents), and aims to maximize his expected revenue.   We focus on \"prior-independent\" mechanisms -- ones that do not use any information about the distribution. They are desirable because knowing the distribution is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. We study how the revenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline mechanism that knows the distribution (\"offline benchmark\").   We present a prior-independent dynamic pricing mechanism whose revenue is at most $O((k \\log n)^{2/3})$ less than the offline benchmark, for every distribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds without *any* assumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we prove a matching lower bound. The performance guarantee for the same mechanism can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{k} \\log n)$, with a distribution-dependent constant, if $k/n$ is sufficiently small. We show that, in the worst case over all demand distributions, this is essentially the best rate that can be obtained with a distribution-specific constant.   On a technical level, we exploit the connection to multi-armed bandits (MAB).

The amplitude of this flow, as measured with Planck, is consistent with earlier findings based on data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). However, the uncertainty assigned to the dipole by the Planck team is much larger than that found in the WMAP studies, leading the authors of the Planck study to conclude that the observed bulk flow is not statistically significant. We here show that two of the three implementations of random sampling used in the error analysis of the Planck study lead to systematic overestimates in the uncertainty of the measured dipole.

It was shown previously that the approach of embedding the graphs into some Euclidean space followed by classification in that space can yields a universally consistent vertex classifier. However, a major technical difficulty of the approach arises when classifying unlabeled out-of-sample vertices without including them in the embedding stage. In this paper, we studied the out-of-sample extension for the graph embedding step and its impact on the subsequent inference tasks. We show that, under the latent position graph model and for sufficiently large $n$, the mapping of the out-of-sample vertices is close to its true latent position.

The method also allows us to incorporate diverse context information into the model while maintaining its computational efficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively (collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances).

The high computational cost of DML arises from the large number of variables to be determined and the constraint that a distance metric has to be a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been successfully applied to improve the efficiency of DML, it can still be computationally expensive because in order to ensure that the solution is a PSD matrix, it has to, at every iteration, project the updated distance metric onto the PSD cone, an expensive operation. We address this challenge by developing two strategies within SGD, i.e. mini-batch and adaptive sampling, to effectively reduce the number of updates (i.e., projections onto the PSD cone) in SGD. We also develop hybrid approaches that combine the strength of adaptive sampling with that of mini-batch online learning techniques to further improve the computational efficiency of SGD for DML.

LDHMMs posit that each sequence is generated by an underlying Markov chain process, which are controlled by the corresponding parameters (i.e., the initial state vector, transition matrix and the emission matrix). These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E and M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and partially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions. We present empirical results of behavior modeling and sequence classification on three real-world data sets, and compare them to other related models.

Various synchronous behaviors, from full synchrony to partial synchrony, can be observed for a given network. Patterns of synchrony, which do not depend on specific dynamics of the network, but only on the network structure, are associated with a special type of partition of cells, termed balanced equivalence relations.

However, designing transformation functions for achieving convergence is a critical and challenging issue. Indeed, the transformation functions proposed in the literature are all revealed incorrect.   In this paper, we investigate the existence of transformation functions for a shared string altered by insert and delete operations. From the theoretical point of view, two properties - named TP1 and TP2 - are necessary and sufficient to ensure convergence. Using controller synthesis technique, we show that there are some transformation functions which satisfy only TP1 for the basic signatures of insert and delete operations. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to meet both properties TP1 and TP2 with these simple signatures.", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the consistency of the operational transformation approach in distributed collaborative editing systems. We address the problem of ensuring consistency among multiple users editing a shared document, where each user has their own local copy of the document.

Learning graphical models from data have been extensively applied for the case of Bayesian networks, but for Markov networks learning it is not tractable in practice. However, this situation is changing with time, given the exponential growth of computers capacity, the plethora of available digital data, and the researching on new learning technologies. This work stresses on a technology called independence-based learning, which allows the learning of the independence structure of those networks from data in an efficient and sound manner, whenever the dataset is sufficiently large, and data is a representative sampling of the target distribution. In the analysis of such technology, this work surveys the current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning Markov networks structure, discussing its current limitations, and proposing a series of open problems where future works may produce some advances in the area in terms of quality and efficiency.

Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective classification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types of data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network. However, most existing approaches measure the dependencies among objects through directly links or indirect links without considering the different semantic meanings behind different paths. In this paper, we study the collective classification problem taht is defined among the same type of objects in heterogenous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage paths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of dependencies among objects. We introduce the concept of meta-path based dependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain sequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification results strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large network size, a novel solution, called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous Collective Classification), is developed to effectively assign labels to a group of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths. The proposed HCC model can capture different types of dependencies among objects with respect to different meta paths.

In contrast to the naive exhaustive search which entails large-scale linear programs, we show that the computational burden can be cut down significantly by a simple two-stage algorithm: (1) projecting the query and data-base subspaces into lower-dimensional space by random Cauchy matrix, and solving small-scale distance evaluations (linear programs) in the projection space to locate candidate nearest; (2) with few candidates upon independent repetition of (1), getting back to the high-dimensional space and performing exhaustive search. To preserve the identity of the nearest subspace with nontrivial probability, the projection dimension typically is low-order polynomial of the subspace dimension multiplied by logarithm of number of the subspaces (Theorem 2.1). The reduced dimensionality and hence complexity renders the proposed algorithm particularly relevant to vision application such as robust face and object instance recognition that we investigate empirically.", "machine_text": "We propose an efficient algorithm for point-to-subspace queries in $\\ell^1$ space, which enables robust object instance recognition in the presence of occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

Building on the techniques of Audibert and Bubeck [2009] and Russo and Roy [2013] we first show that Thompson Sampling attains an optimal prior-free bound in the sense that for any prior distribution its Bayesian regret is bounded from above by $14 \\sqrt{n K}$.

We also study the case of priors for the setting of Bubeck et al.

Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the Gabor transformed images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted high-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent high intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms the basis of the work. Finally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are considered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing ICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is twofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the Gabor transformed face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation selectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally salient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy and represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are most useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall. The efficiency of IHIF method is demonstrated by the experiment on frontal facial images dataset, selected from the FERET, FRAV2D, and the ORL database.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the challenging problem of high-performance human face recognition, which is crucial for various applications such as surveillance, law enforcement, and biometric authentication.

For instance, the 9/11 terrorist events produced nearly 3000 fatalities, nearly six times more than the next largest event. But, was this enormous loss of life statistically unlikely given modern terrorism's historical record? Accurately estimating the probability of such an event is complicated by the large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's upper tail. We present a generic statistical algorithm for making such estimates, which combines semi-parametric models of tail behavior and a nonparametric bootstrap. Applied to a global database of terrorist events, we estimate the worldwide historical probability of observing at least one 9/11-sized or larger event since 1968 to be 11-35%. These results are robust to conditioning on global variations in economic development, domestic versus international events, the type of weapon used and a truncated history that stops at 1998. We then use this procedure to make a data-driven statistical forecast of at least one similar event over the next decade.", "machine_text": "We estimate the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist events by developing a novel Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates multiple data sources, including event reports, casualty data, and socioeconomic indicators.

In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding `scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences.   In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g. each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order-optimal.", "machine_text": "We introduce Rank Centrality, a novel ranking method that leverages pair-wise comparisons to assign scores to entities.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of Rank Centrality through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to accurately capture subtle differences in ranking. Our results highlight the potential of Rank Centrality in various applications, including network analysis, recommender systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.

In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the problem of feature selection for face recognition using sparse approximation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the sparsity of face representation to identify the most informative features. Our method, dubbed SparseFace, utilizes a sparse coding framework to learn a dictionary of atoms that represent the underlying structure of face images. By selecting the top-k atoms with the highest coefficients, we obtain a subset of features that are most relevant for face recognition. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseFace, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and expression. Our approach provides a new perspective on feature selection for face recognition, highlighting the importance of sparsity in capturing the underlying structure of face images.    "}

The method is based on a key sociological insight that has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years, but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that resource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective consistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments about identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient affective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental sentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent with, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent with, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This \"affect control principle\" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of this principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively intelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make value-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively intelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity, predicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking actions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our model can be used as an emotional \"plug-in\" for artificially intelligent systems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice assistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive disability.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel approach to intelligent affective interaction using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simulating and predicting human affective responses to different stimuli and interactions. We show that our model can accurately infer the user's emotional state and adapt its response to maintain a positive emotional state. The key ideas and methodologies employed include the use of affective computing, POMDPs, and reinforcement learning. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction by enabling systems to better understand and respond to human emotions, leading to more effective and engaging interactions.

In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the \"Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture\", which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the \"Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture\", which says that |Per(A)|>=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics.

Our approach is based on a novel probabilistic representation of causal graphs, which allows us to integrate both observational and experimental data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BCNL on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the potential of BCNL for applications in epidemiology, economics, and other fields where causal inference is crucial.    "}

We built a hybrid model based on Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) to identify the composer from audio signal. As a matter of copyright, sponsors of MIREX cannot publish their data set. We built a comparable data set to test our model. We got an accuracy of 76.26% in our data set which is better than some pure models and shallow models. We think our method is promising even though we test it in a different data set, since our data set is comparable to that in MIREX by size. We also found that samples from different classes become farther away from each other when transformed by more layers in our model.", "machine_text": "In this study, we propose an innovative approach to identify classical composers based on audio features extracted from their compositions. We address the problem of composer identification, which has garnered significant attention in the music information retrieval community, by leveraging the capabilities of deep neural networks. Our methodology involves extracting a set of audio features from a dataset of classical music pieces, which are then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a composer-specific representation. The learned representation is then used to classify new, unseen music pieces into their respective composers. Our experimental results demonstrate a high accuracy of 94.5% in identifying composers, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The key to our success lies in the ability of the CNN to capture complex patterns and relationships in the audio features, allowing for a robust and generalizable composer identification system. Our findings have significant implications for music information retrieval, music recommendation systems, and music education, and demonstrate the potential of deep learning techniques in unlocking the secrets of classical music.

We propose using the inherent structures in the genome; to divide the bigger problem into manageable parts. In plant and animal breeding studies a distinction is made between the commercial value (additive + epistatic genetic effects) and the breeding value (additive genetic effects) of an individual since it is expected that some of the epistatic genetic effects will be lost due to recombination. In this paper, we argue that the breeder can take advantage of some of the epistatic marker effects in regions of low recombination. The models introduced here aim to estimate local epistatic line heritability by using the genetic map information and combine the local additive and epistatic effects.

We consider a typical multiscale registration setting where the global 2-D translation between a pair of images is estimated by smoothing the images and minimizing the distance between them with gradient descent. Our study particularly concentrates on the effect of noise and low-pass filtering on the alignment accuracy. We adopt an analytic representation for images and analyze the well-behavedness of the image distance function by estimating the neighborhood of translations for which it is free of undesired local minima. This corresponds to the neighborhood of translation vectors that are correctly computable with a simple gradient descent minimization. We show that the area of this neighborhood increases at least quadratically with the smoothing filter size, which justifies the use of a smoothing step in image registration with local optimizers such as gradient descent. We then examine the effect of noise on the alignment accuracy and derive an upper bound for the alignment error in terms of the noise properties and filter size. Our main finding is that the error increases at a rate that is at least linear with respect to the filter size. Therefore, smoothing improves the well-behavedness of the distance function; however, this comes at the cost of amplifying the alignment error in noisy settings. Our results provide a mathematical insight about why hierarchical techniques are effective in image registration, suggesting that the multiscale coarse-to-fine alignment strategy of these techniques is very suitable from the perspective of the trade-off between the well-behavedness of the objective function and the registration accuracy.

In real-world applications, however, face images usually suffer from expressions, disguises and random occlusions. The problematic facial parts undermine the validity of the linear-subspace assumption and thus the recognition performance deteriorates significantly. In this work, we address the problem in a learning-inference-mixed fashion. By observing that the linear-subspace assumption is more reliable on certain face patches rather than on the holistic face, some Bayesian Patch Representations (BPRs) are randomly generated and interpreted according to the Bayes' theory. We then train an ensemble model over the patch-representations by minimizing the empirical risk w.r.t the \"leave-one-out margins\". The obtained model is termed Optimal Representation Ensemble (ORE), since it guarantees the optimality from the perspective of Empirical Risk Minimization. To handle the unknown patterns in test faces, a robust version of BPR is proposed by taking the non-face category into consideration. Equipped with the Robust-BPRs, the inference ability of ORE is increased dramatically and several record-breaking accuracies (99.9% on Yale-B and 99.5% on AR) and desirable efficiencies (below 20 ms per face in Matlab) are achieved. It also overwhelms other modular heuristics on the faces with random occlusions, extreme expressions and disguises. Furthermore, to accommodate immense BPRs sets, a boosting-like algorithm is also derived. The boosted model, a.k.a Boosted-ORE, obtains similar performance to its prototype.

This paper proposes a framework for decomposing the UGMS problem into multiple subproblems over clusters and subsets of the separators in a junction tree. The junction tree is constructed using a graph that contains a superset of the edges in G*. We highlight three main properties of using junction trees for UGMS. First, different regularization parameters or different UGMS algorithms can be used to learn different parts of the graph. This is possible since the subproblems we identify can be solved independently of each other. Second, under certain conditions, a junction tree based UGMS algorithm can produce consistent results with fewer observations than the usual requirements of existing algorithms. Third, both our theoretical and experimental results show that the junction tree framework does a significantly better job at finding the weakest edges in a graph than existing methods.

The entropy of this belief network is calculated, and that arc is added that minimizes the entropy of the resulting belief network. Conditional probabilities for an arc are obtained directly from the database. This process continues until an entropy-based threshold is reached.

Most previous theoretical work on classification with label noise assumes that the two classes are separable, that the label noise is independent of the true class label, or that the noise proportions for each class are known. In this work, we give conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the true class-conditional distributions to be identifiable. These conditions are weaker than those analyzed previously, and allow for the classes to be nonseparable and the noise levels to be asymmetric and unknown. The conditions essentially state that a majority of the observed labels are correct and that the true class-conditional distributions are \"mutually irreducible,\" a concept we introduce that limits the similarity of the two distributions. For any label noise problem, there is a unique pair of true class-conditional distributions satisfying the proposed conditions, and we argue that this pair corresponds in a certain sense to maximal denoising of the observed distributions.   Our results are facilitated by a connection to \"mixture proportion estimation,\" which is the problem of estimating the maximal proportion of one distribution that is present in another.

Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $O(1/T)$ {assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved}, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.", "machine_text": "We propose an efficient primal-dual proximal method for solving non-smooth optimization problems, which are ubiquitous in machine learning, signal processing, and other fields.

PDP iteratively updates primal and dual variables using a proximal operator and a dual update rule, respectively. The key innovation lies in the design of a novel, adaptive step-size strategy that balances the trade-off between primal and dual progress. Our method enjoys fast convergence rates and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDP through extensive experiments on various non-smooth optimization problems, including L1-regularized least squares and total variation denoising.

Specifically, we may wish to estimate a brain network for the normal controls (NC), a brain network for the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a brain network for Alzheimer's patients (AD). We expect the two brain networks for NC and MCI to share common structures but not to be identical to each other; similarly for the two brain networks for MCI and AD. The proposed formulation can be solved using a second-order method. Our key technical contribution is to establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be decomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is presented, which decomposes the large graphs into small subgraphs and allows an efficient estimation of multiple independent (small) subgraphs, dramatically reducing the computational cost.

The method can be interpreted as a template-based blind watermarking scheme, robust to common editing operations, namely: cropping, rotation, scaling, stretching, shearing, compression, printing, scanning, noise, and color removal. Robustness is achieved through the reciprocity of the embedding and detection invariants. The embedded patterns are real onedimensional Mellin monomial patterns distributed over two-dimensions. The embedded patterns are scale invariant and can be directly embedded in an image by simple pixel addition. Detection achieves rotation and general affine invariance by signal projection using implicit Radon transformation. Embedded signals contract to one-dimension in the two-dimensional Fourier polar domain. The real signals are detected by correlation with complex Mellin monomial templates. Using a unique template of 4 chirp patterns we detect the affine signature with exquisite sensitivity and moderate security. The practical implementation achieves efficiencies through fast Fourier transform (FFT) correspondences such as the projection-slice theorem, the FFT correlation relation, and fast resampling via the chirp-z transform. The overall method utilizes orthodox spread spectrum patterns for the payload and performs well in terms of the classic robustness-capacity-visibility performance triangle.

An important but poorly understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing. Here, we present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing, C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller). Unlike previously proposed algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information maximization (Infomax) [Butko & Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy [Najemnik & Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and effort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly inadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity. These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel framework for active sensing that leverages Bayesian inference and sequential decision theory to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off in complex sensing tasks.

Our framework, termed Bayes-Optimal Sequential Decision Making (BOSDM), iteratively updates the posterior distribution over the sensing parameters and optimizes the next sensing action to maximize the expected information gain. We derive a closed-form solution for the optimal sensing policy using the principles of Bayesian inference and dynamic programming. Experimental results on various sensing tasks, including object recognition and parameter estimation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BOSDM in achieving superior performance and adaptability compared to traditional sensing approaches.

Moreover, by constructing a classifier that relies on all features the interpretation of the results is challenging. Our goal is to provide robust classification that relies only on a small subset of important features and accounts for the underlying correlation structure. We apply a lasso-type penalty to the discriminant vector to ensure sparsity of the solution and use a shrinkage type estimator for the covariance matrix. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an iterative coordinate ascent algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of nonconvexity on the sparsity level of the solution and highlight the difference between the penalized and the constrained versions of the problem.

Next, we implement a dimensionality reduction process with simultaneous sparse approximations and subspace projection. It permits to represent each 3D face by only a few spherical functions that are able to capture the salient facial characteristics, and hence to preserve the discriminant facial information. We eventually perform recognition by effective matching in the reduced space, where Linear Discriminant Analysis can be further activated for improved recognition performance. The 3D face recognition algorithm is evaluated on the FRGC v.1.0 data set, where it is shown to outperform classical state-of-the-art solutions that work with depth images.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to 3D face recognition using sparse spherical representations. In this work, we address the problem of efficiently representing and matching 3D facial shapes while dealing with the inherent complexity and variability of human faces. Our methodology is based on the idea of representing 3D faces as sparse sets of spherical harmonics, which allows us to effectively capture the facial shape and structure while reducing the dimensionality of the representation. We employ a sparse reconstruction framework to learn the spherical harmonics that best describe the facial shape, and then use a nearest-neighbor approach to match the 3D faces. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including the challenging FRGC v2 dataset. Our method shows a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to existing 3D face recognition methods, particularly in the presence of varying lighting conditions and facial expressions.

For the discounted case, we propose a new discount scheme, which is different from the conventional form but consistent with the existing literature, while for the average risk criterion, we state Lyapunov-like stability conditions that generalize known conditions for Markov chains to ensure the existence of solutions to the optimality equation.", "machine_text": "We formulate and analyze risk-sensitive Markov control processes, which are a class of stochastic control problems that balance the expected reward with the risk of failure. We address the problem of finding optimal policies that maximize the expected cumulative reward while minimizing the probability of exceeding a given risk threshold.

The literature has not, however, come to any consensus on a formal definition of a confounder, as it has given priority to the concept of confounding over that of a confounder. We consider a number of candidate definitions arising from various more informal statements made in the literature. We consider the properties satisfied by each candidate definition, principally focusing on (i) whether under the candidate definition control for all \"confounders\" suffices to control for \"confounding\" and (ii) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias. Several of the candidate definitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a \"confounder\" be defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on (X,C) but such that for no proper subset of (X,C) is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset. We also provide a conditional analogue of the above definition; and we propose a variable that helps reduce bias but not eliminate bias be referred to as a \"surrogate confounder.\" These definitions are closely related to those given by Robins and Morgenstern [Comput. Math. Appl. 14 (1987) 869-916].

Our definition, grounded in the principles of causal graph theory and Bayesian network modeling, provides a clear and operationalizable framework for identifying and controlling confounding variables in observational studies. We demonstrate the practical utility of our definition through a series of empirical examples and simulations, showcasing its ability to correctly identify confounders and avoid biases in a range of scenarios.

In order to capture the local spatial variations within these highinformative horizontal bands precisely, the horizontal band is segmented into several small spatial modules. Dominant wavelet coefficients corresponding to each local region residing inside those horizontal bands are selected as features. In the selection of the dominant coefficients, a threshold criterion is proposed, which not only drastically reduces the feature dimension but also provides high within-class compactness and high between-class separability. A principal component analysis is performed to further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.

For this reason, it is important to have efficient computational methods and algorithms that can be applied on large datasets, such that it is still possible to complete the machine learning tasks in reasonable time. In this context, we present in this paper a more accurate simple process to speed up ML methods. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is combined with Expectation, Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an efficient Hidden Markov Model (HMM) training. The idea of the proposed process consists of two steps. In the first step, training instances with similar inputs are clustered and a weight factor which represents the frequency of these instances is assigned to each representative cluster. Dynamic Time Warping technique is used as a dissimilarity function to cluster similar examples. In the second step, all formulas in the classical HMM training algorithm (EM) associated with the number of training instances are modified to include the weight factor in appropriate terms. This process significantly accelerates HMM training while maintaining the same initial, transition and emission probabilities matrixes as those obtained with the classical HMM training algorithm. Accordingly, the classification accuracy is preserved. Depending on the size of the training set, speedups of up to 2200 times is possible when the size is about 100.000 instances.

In this paper, we introduce a maximum entropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional data such as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independence assumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, by enforcing a `maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditional densities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys ($J$) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend our method to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach by considering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence by Jensen-Shannon ($JS$) divergence to discriminate conditional densities of multiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a modified Jensen-Shannon divergence ($JS_{GM}$), based on AM-GM inequality. We show that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys divergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical justifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best features in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using $J-$divergence emerges naturally in binary classification.

In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the widely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures. Although there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little is known about its theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function is, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as the number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result is very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot differentiate good and bad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many applications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in general, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This notion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a property: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent distinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking functions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for NDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we show that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast the discount decays, and 1/r is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off version of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the distinguishability of NDCG@k for various choices of k and the discount functions. Experimental results on real Web search datasets agree well with the theory.", "machine_text": "In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis of NDCG-type ranking measures, which have been widely used in information retrieval and recommendation systems.

Our key findings highlight the importance of considering the specific properties of each ranking measure when selecting the most suitable measure for a particular application. We also identify a new ranking measure that outperforms existing NDCG-type measures in certain scenarios, offering a potential solution for improving the accuracy of ranking-based systems.

A classical example of an associative memory is the Hopfield neural network. Recently, Gripon and Berrou have introduced an alternative construction which builds on ideas from the theory of error correcting codes and which greatly outperforms the Hopfield network in capacity, diversity, and efficiency. In this paper we implement a variation of the Gripon-Berrou associative memory on a general purpose graphical processing unit (GPU). The work of Gripon and Berrou proposes two retrieval rules, sum-of-sum and sum-of-max. The sum-of-sum rule uses only matrix-vector multiplication and is easily implemented on the GPU. The sum-of-max rule is much less straightforward to implement because it involves non-linear operations. However, the sum-of-max rule gives significantly better retrieval error rates.

We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.", "machine_text": "We investigate the categorical compositional distributional model of meaning, which posits that word meanings arise from the composition of more basic semantic primitives. Our experiment tests the model's predictions by having human participants rate the semantic similarity between novel compounds and their constituent words. We find that the model accurately predicts the similarity ratings, demonstrating that the categorical compositional distributional model of meaning provides a viable framework for understanding how words convey meaning. Our results also highlight the importance of considering the compositional structure of words when modeling semantic similarity. We use a novel combination of methods, including linear regression, clustering, and information-theoretic metrics, to analyze the data and evaluate the model's performance.

We assume also that the stations may have varying parameters of, for example, the link layer performance (SINR threshold, etc). By studying the propagation processes of signals received by the typical user from all antennas marked by the corresponding antenna parameters, we show that seemingly different heterogeneous networks based on Poisson point processes can be equivalent from the point of view a typical user. These neworks can be replaced with a model where all the previously varying propagation parameters (including path-loss exponents) are set to constants while the only trade-off being the introduction of an isotropic base station density. This allows one to perform analytic comparisons of different network models via their isotropic representations. In the case of a constant path-loss exponent, the isotropic representation simplifies to a homogeneous modification of the constant intensity of the original network, thus generalizing a previous result showing that the propagation processes only depend on one moment of the emitted power and propagation effects. We give examples and applications to motivate these results and highlight an interesting observation regarding random path-loss exponents.", "machine_text": "In this study, we investigate the equivalence and comparison of heterogeneous cellular networks, where we address the problem of evaluating the performance of different network architectures.

Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using established mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e. implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be modelled.

The model is based on a theory of culture according to which what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal models of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a Darwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving exchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of actions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of actions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and density, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase fitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by sharing of fit actions.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PAC-Bayes bounds based on confusion matrices.", "machine_text": "We derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound on the confusion matrix for multi-class classification, addressing the long-standing problem of providing a reliable estimate of the classification performance for a new, unseen dataset. Our approach leverages the PAC-Bayesian framework to upper-bound the expected confusion matrix by integrating over the uncertainty in the model's predictions. We demonstrate that our bound is tight, providing a reliable estimate of the classification performance, and is applicable to a wide range of classification algorithms. Our methodology involves constructing a Bayesian model that combines a probabilistic classifier with a prior distribution over the classifier's parameters, and then using PAC-Bayesian theory to derive a generalization bound on the expected confusion matrix. We evaluate our bound on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing a reliable estimate of the classification performance for unseen data. Our results highlight the importance of considering the uncertainty in the model's predictions when evaluating the generalization performance of a classification algorithm.

In this paper we propose and analyze a max-norm constrained empirical risk minimization method for noisy matrix completion under a general sampling model. The optimal rate of convergence is established under the Frobenius norm loss in the context of approximately low-rank matrix reconstruction.

Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.

RC is a computational paradigm in which a trained readout layer interprets the dynamics of an excitable component (called the reservoir) that is perturbed by external input. The reservoir is often implemented as a homogeneous recurrent neural network, but there has been little investigation into the properties of reservoirs that are discrete and heterogeneous. Random Boolean networks are generic and heterogeneous dynamical systems and here we use them as the reservoir. An RBN is typically a closed system; to use it as a reservoir we extend it with an input layer. As a consequence of perturbation, the RBN does not necessarily fall into an attractor. Computational capability in RC arises from a trade-off between separability and fading memory of inputs. We find the balance of these properties predictive of classification power and optimal at critical connectivity.

In this paper we establish strong oracle properties of nonconcave penalized methods for nonpolynomial (NP) dimensional data with censoring in the framework of Cox's proportional hazards model. A class of folded-concave penalties are employed and both LASSO and SCAD are discussed specifically. We unveil the question under which dimensionality and correlation restrictions can an oracle estimator be constructed and grasped. It is demonstrated that nonconcave penalties lead to significant reduction of the \"irrepresentable condition\" needed for LASSO model selection consistency. The large deviation result for martingales, bearing interests of its own, is developed for characterizing the strong oracle property. Moreover, the nonconcave regularized estimator, is shown to achieve asymptotically the information bound of the oracle estimator. A coordinate-wise algorithm is developed for finding the grid of solution paths for penalized hazard regression problems, and its performance is evaluated on simulated and gene association study examples.", "machine_text": "We address the problem of regularization in Cox's proportional hazards model, which is a popular method for analyzing time-to-event data. However, the model's performance degrades significantly when the number of predictors (p) exceeds the sample size (n), a phenomenon known as the \"curse of dimensionality.\" To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel regularization framework that leverages the structure of the Cox model and the properties of the underlying data. Our approach combines the strengths of lasso and elastic net regularization with a novel penalty term that encourages sparsity in the model's coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using simulations and real-world datasets, showing that it can significantly improve the model's performance and interpretability in high-dimensional settings.

In this paper, we introduce and study a related quantity, called the restricted nonnegative rank. We show that computing this quantity is equivalent to a problem in polyhedral combinatorics, and fully characterize its computational complexity. This in turn sheds new light on the nonnegative rank problem, and in particular allows us to provide new improved lower bounds based on its geometric interpretation. We apply these results to slack matrices and linear Euclidean distance matrices and obtain counter-examples to two conjectures of Beasly and Laffey, namely we show that the nonnegative rank of linear Euclidean distance matrices is not necessarily equal to their dimension, and that the rank of a matrix is not always greater than the nonnegative rank of its square.", "machine_text": "We investigate the geometric interpretation of the nonnegative rank of a matrix, a fundamental concept in linear algebra and optimization. We address the problem of understanding the relationship between the nonnegative rank of a matrix and its geometric properties, such as the dimension of the subspace spanned by its columns. Our key idea is to embed the matrix in a higher-dimensional space and study the geometry of the resulting polyhedral cone. We employ a combination of algebraic and geometric techniques, including linear programming, semidefinite programming, and convex optimization, to establish a precise connection between the nonnegative rank and the geometry of the cone. Our results provide a new perspective on the nonnegative rank, revealing its intimate connection to the geometry of the matrix and its applications in various fields, including computer vision, machine learning, and data analysis. By shedding light on the geometric interpretation of the nonnegative rank, our work opens up new avenues for research and has significant implications for the development of efficient algorithms and computational methods for matrix factorization and optimization problems.

In contrast to the usual randomized block coordinate descent method [23,20], our method has a nonmonotone flavor and uses variable stepsizes that can partially utilize the local curvature information of the smooth component of objective function. We show that any accumulation point of the solution sequence of the method is a stationary point of the problem {\\it almost surely} and the method is capable of finding an approximate stationary point with high probability. We also establish a sublinear rate of convergence for the method in terms of the minimal expected squared norm of certain proximal gradients over the iterations. When the problem under consideration is convex, we show that the expected objective values generated by RNBPG converge to the optimal value of the problem. Under some assumptions, we further establish a sublinear and linear rate of convergence on the expected objective values generated by a monotone version of RNBPG.

One of the key challenges in sequence transduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a way that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations. However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since \\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the output sequence is often challenging.

In the case where the energy distance is computed with a semimetric of negative type, a positive definite kernel, termed distance kernel, may be defined such that the MMD corresponds exactly to the energy distance. Conversely, for any positive definite kernel, we can interpret the MMD as energy distance with respect to some negative-type semimetric. This equivalence readily extends to distance covariance using kernels on the product space. We determine the class of probability distributions for which the test statistics are consistent against all alternatives.

The computational costs and bond dimensions as functions of time and temperature are examined for the example of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain in the critical XY phase and the gapped N\\'eel phase. The matrix product state purifications occurring in the algorithms are in one-to-one relation with corresponding matrix product operators. This notational simplification elucidates implications of quasi-locality on the computational costs. Based on the observation that there is considerable freedom in designing efficient tDMRG schemes for the calculation of dynamical correlators at finite temperatures, a new class of optimizable schemes, as recently suggested in arXiv:1212.3570, is explained and analyzed numerically. A specific novel near-optimal scheme that requires no additional optimization reaches maximum times that are typically increased by a factor of two, when compared against earlier approaches. These increased reachable times make many more physical applications accessible. For each of the described tDMRG schemes, one can devise a corresponding transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) variant.", "machine_text": "We have developed an optimized density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scheme to precisely evaluate thermal response functions in quantum many-body systems.

The classical alternating direction type methods usually assume that the two convex functions have relatively easy proximal mappings. However, many problems arising from statistics, image processing and other fields have the structure that while one of the two functions has easy proximal mapping, the other function is smoothly convex but does not have an easy proximal mapping. Therefore, the classical alternating direction methods cannot be applied. To deal with the difficulty, we propose in this paper an alternating direction method based on extragradients. Under the assumption that the smooth function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, we prove that the proposed method returns an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution within $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iterations. We apply the proposed method to solve a new statistical model called fused logistic regression. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method performs very well when solving the test problems. We also test the performance of the proposed method through solving the lasso problem arising from statistics and compare the result with several existing efficient solvers for this problem; the results are very encouraging indeed.", "machine_text": "We propose an extragradient-based alternating direction method for solving convex minimization problems.

Our method is based on a sequence of iterative updates that alternate between two directions: one that minimizes the smooth term and another that minimizes the nonsmooth term. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments on various test problems, including those with large-scale matrices and nonconvex constraints. Our results show that our method converges to the optimal solution at a faster rate compared to existing methods, and it is robust to noisy data and nonconvex constraints.

One approach consists in recovering a local parameterization using the local tangent plane. Principal component analysis (PCA) is often the tool of choice, as it returns an optimal basis in the case of noise-free samples from a linear subspace. To process noisy data samples from a nonlinear manifold, PCA must be applied locally, at a scale small enough such that the manifold is approximately linear, but at a scale large enough such that structure may be discerned from noise. Using eigenspace perturbation theory and non-asymptotic random matrix theory, we study the stability of the subspace estimated by PCA as a function of scale, and bound (with high probability) the angle it forms with the true tangent space. By adaptively selecting the scale that minimizes this bound, our analysis reveals an appropriate scale for local tangent plane recovery. We also introduce a geometric uncertainty principle quantifying the limits of noise-curvature perturbation for stable recovery. With the purpose of providing perturbation bounds that can be used in practice, we propose plug-in estimates that make it possible to directly apply the theoretical results to real data sets.", "machine_text": "We present a non-asymptotic analysis of tangent space perturbation, a fundamental problem in optimization and machine learning.

We demonstrate that our method provides a tighter bound than existing results, and is computationally efficient. Our results have significant implications for the development of robust optimization algorithms, and have the potential to improve the performance of a wide range of machine learning models.

We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty).", "machine_text": "We propose a novel framework for generative modeling, where generalized denoising auto-encoders (GDAEs) are leveraged as generative models.

This paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm for solving this satisfiability problem. 3-SAT problem has the huge search space and hence it is known as a NP-hard problem. So, deterministic approaches are not applicable in this context. Thereof, application of evolutionary processing approaches and especially PSO will be very effective for solving these kinds of problems. In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary optimization technique based on PSO, Memetic algorithm and local search approaches. When some heuristics are mixed, their advantages are collected as well and we can reach to the better outcomes.

The results showed that the winning algorithm achieved an average F1-score of 0.933, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

The algorithm, termed Compressive Adaptive Sense and Search (CASS), is shown to be near-optimal in that it succeeds at the lowest possible signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) levels, improving on previous work in adaptive compressed sensing. Like traditional compressed sensing based on random non-adaptive design matrices, the CASS algorithm requires only k log n measurements to recover a k-sparse signal of dimension n. However, CASS succeeds at SNR levels that are a factor log n less than required by standard compressed sensing. From the point of view of constructing and implementing the sensing operation as well as computing the reconstruction, the proposed algorithm is substantially less computationally intensive than standard compressed sensing. CASS is also demonstrated to perform considerably better in practice through simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an adaptive compressed sensing algorithm with near-optimal theoretical guarantees and excellent practical performance.

Recently, this problem has been formulated as recovering a low-rank component and a sparse component from the observed data matrix. It is proved that under some suitable conditions, this problem can be exactly solved by principal component pursuit (PCP), i.e., minimizing a combination of nuclear norm and $l_1$ norm. Most of the existing methods for solving PCP require singular value decompositions (SVD) of the data matrix, resulting in a high computational complexity, hence preventing the applications of RPCA to very large scale computer vision problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called $l_1$ filtering, for \\emph{exactly} solving PCP with an $O(r^2(m+n))$ complexity, where $m\\times n$ is the size of data matrix and $r$ is the rank of the matrix to recover, which is supposed to be much smaller than $m$ and $n$. Moreover, $l_1$ filtering is \\emph{highly parallelizable}. It is the first algorithm that can \\emph{exactly} solve a nuclear norm minimization problem in \\emph{linear time} (with respect to the data size). Experiments on both synthetic data and real applications testify to the great advantage of $l_1$ filtering in speed over state-of-the-art algorithms.", "machine_text": "Strictly KEEP the word count between      We solve the principal component pursuit (PCP) problem in linear time by introducing a novel $l_1$ filtering approach. The PCP problem is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and signal processing, where one seeks to recover the principal components of a matrix from a subset of its columns. Existing methods for solving PCP are computationally expensive, often requiring quadratic or even cubic time complexity. In contrast, our approach exploits the structure of the problem to achieve linear time complexity, making it scalable to large datasets. We achieve this by iteratively filtering the input matrix using a carefully designed $l_1$ norm-based operator, which selectively removes irrelevant components while preserving the relevant ones. Our method is simple to implement, easy to parallelize, and has a low computational cost, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance while being computationally efficient.

We systematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical processes are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically, we find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as it is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas exhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher redshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and to a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height of the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the present, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole feedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both boost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated fashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback from massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and accretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF law. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency is changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same rate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting black holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate below redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the form of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.", "machine_text": "We have used a combination of observational and theoretical approaches to investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation history.

We find that the depletion of gas is linked to the formation of massive black holes, which regulate the growth of their host galaxies through feedback mechanisms. Our results also suggest that the reionization of the intergalactic medium plays a crucial role in regulating the early star formation, with the ionizing radiation from the first stars and galaxies acting as a brake on the growth of the cosmic star formation rate. By combining observations of galaxy properties, such as gas fractions and black hole masses, with simulations of galaxy evolution, we have been able to constrain the physical processes that drive the cosmic star formation history. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between gas, stars, and black holes that shapes the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.    "}

The evaluation experiment, called Shootout-89, took place in Boulder, and focussed on storms over the northeastern Colorado foothills and plains (Moninger, et al., 1990). Six systems participated in Shootout-89. These included traditional expert systems, an analogy-based system, and a system developed using methods from the cognitive science/judgment analysis tradition. Each day of the exercise, the systems generated 2 to 9 hour forecasts of the probabilities of occurrence of: non significant weather, significant weather, and severe weather, in each of four regions in northeastern Colorado. A verification coordinator working at the Denver Weather Service Forecast Office gathered ground-truth data from a network of observers. Systems were evaluated on the basis of several measures of forecast skill, and on other metrics such as timeliness, ease of learning, and ease of use. Systems were generally easy to operate, however the various systems required substantially different levels of meteorological expertise on the part of their users--reflecting the various operational environments for which the systems had been designed. Systems varied in their statistical behavior, but on this difficult forecast problem, the systems generally showed a skill approximately equal to that of persistence forecasts and climatological (historical frequency) forecasts. The two systems that appeared best able to discriminate significant from non significant weather events were traditional expert systems. Both of these systems required the operator to make relatively sophisticated meteorological judgments. We are unable, based on only one summer's worth of data, to determine the extent to which the greater skill of the two systems was due to the content of their knowledge bases, or to the subjective judgments of the operator. A follow-on experiment, Shootout-91, is currently being planned.

Our results show that the most accurate system, which integrated meteorological data with machine learning algorithms, achieved an accuracy rate of 85.7%. In contrast, the least accurate system, which relied solely on traditional meteorological models, achieved an accuracy rate of 55.6%.

Specifically, it presents an active learning algorithm based on an arbitrary classification-calibrated surrogate loss function, along with an analysis of the number of label requests sufficient for the classifier returned by the algorithm to achieve a given risk under the 0-1 loss. Interestingly, these results cannot be obtained by simply optimizing the surrogate risk via active learning to an extent sufficient to provide a guarantee on the 0-1 loss, as is common practice in the analysis of surrogate losses for passive learning.

Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly improved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better classification accuracy.

We consider approachability in games with partial monitoring. In previous works (Perchet 2011; Mannor et al. 2011) we provided a dual characterization of approachable convex sets; we also exhibited efficient strategies in the case where C is a polytope. In this paper we provide primal conditions on a convex set to be approachable with partial monitoring. They depend on a modified reward function and lead to approachability strategies, based on modified payoff functions, that proceed by projections similarly to Blackwell's (1956) strategy; this is in contrast with previously studied strategies in this context that relied mostly on the signaling structure and aimed at estimating well the distributions of the signals received.

The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566--1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data---creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them---we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a sticky emission probability distribution, which we refer to as the sticky HDP-HMM. This model addresses the challenge of speaker diarization, where the goal is to identify and track individual speakers in a multi-speaker audio recording. Our approach leverages the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to model the speaker's voice characteristics, allowing for flexible and adaptive clustering of speakers. The sticky emission probability distribution captures the temporal dependencies between consecutive frames, enabling the model to effectively handle overlapping speech and speaker changes. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in speaker diarization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that the sticky HDP-HMM effectively handles complex speaker scenarios, including speaker overlap, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in speaker diarization. The proposed model provides a robust and efficient framework for speaker diarization, with potential applications in various fields, including speech recognition, audio analysis, and multimedia processing.

Since the beginning of 90s the subject has became a major issue. This technology is used in many important real-world applications, such as video surveillance, smart cards, database security, internet and intranet access. This report reviews recent two algorithms for face recognition which take advantage of a relatively new multiscale geometric analysis tool - Curvelet transform, for facial processing and feature extraction. This transform proves to be efficient especially due to its good ability to detect curves and lines, which characterize the human's face. An algorithm which is based on the two algorithms mentioned above is proposed, and its performance is evaluated on three data bases of faces: AT&T (ORL), Essex Grimace and Georgia-Tech. k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. This algorithm shows good results, and it even outperforms other algorithms in some cases.", "machine_text": "In this study, we propose a novel approach to face recognition using the Curvelet transform.

[Binford et al. 1987] Recognition proceeds by drawing up a network model from the object's geometric and functional description that predicts the appearance of an object. Then this network is used to find the object within a photographic image. Many existing and proposed techniques for vision recognition resemble the uncertainty calculations of a Bayes net. In contrast, though, they lack a derivation from first principles, and tend to rely on arbitrary parameters that we hope to avoid by a network model. The connectedness of the network depends on what independence considerations can be identified in the vision problem. Greater independence leads to easier calculations, at the expense of the net's expressiveness. Once this trade-off is made and the structure of the network is determined, it should be possible to tailor a solution technique for it. This paper explores the use of a network with multiply connected paths, drawing on both techniques of belief networks [Pearl 86] and influence diagrams. We then demonstrate how one formulation of a multiply connected network can be solved.", "machine_text": "We have developed a novel approach to modeling the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) for vision recognition tasks. Our work addresses the long-standing problem of constructing accurate and efficient BNs for computer vision applications, where the complexity of the visual scene and the large number of variables involved make it challenging to define a meaningful probability distribution. We propose a hierarchical and modular approach to BN construction, which leverages the spatial and temporal dependencies present in visual data to define a compact and interpretable model. Our methodology involves a two-stage process: first, we identify a set of key features and variables that are relevant to the recognition task, and then we use a combination of spatial and temporal dependencies to define the structure of the BN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments on benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in several recognition tasks. Our results show that the proposed approach can effectively capture the complex dependencies present in visual data, leading to improved recognition accuracy and efficiency.    "}

Our derivation procedure does not explicitly involve any small parameter and is straightforward. The novel system is a non-dispersive non-hydrostatic extension of the classical Saint-Venant equations. A key feature of the new model is that, like the classical NSWE, it is hyperbolic and thus similar numerical methods can be used.

Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest.

First we argue in favor of the thesis that all multiverses except Tegmark's <<mathematical multiverse>> are too small to explain the fine tuning, so that they merely shift the problem up one level. But the <<mathematical multiverse>> is surely too large. To prove this assessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of complex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical multiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular Conway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong. But if the results of our experiments can be extrapolated to our universe, we should expect to inhabit -- in the context of the multiverse -- a world in which at least some of the laws and constants of nature should show a certain time dependence. Actually, the probability of our existence in a world such as ours would be mathematically equal to zero. In consequence, the results presented in this paper can be considered as an inkling that the hypothesis of the multiverse, whatever its type, does not offer an adequate explanation for the peculiarities of the physical laws in our world.

The availability of wide entropy variations motivated us for an investigation over the suitability preference of these versions to specific operations. Methodologies were implemented in Matlab and were enhanced with entropy variations. Evaluation of various implementations was based on different statistical parameters with reference to the study area The popular available versions like Tsalli's, Shanon's, and Renyi's entropies were analysed in context of various remote sensing operations namely thresholding, clustering and registration.", "machine_text": "We conducted a comparative analysis on the applicability of entropy in remote sensing, addressing the challenge of quantifying and characterizing the uncertainty associated with remotely sensed data. By employing a range of entropy-based methods, including Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Renyi entropy, we evaluated their effectiveness in capturing the complexities of various remote sensing datasets. Our results demonstrate that entropy-based approaches can provide valuable insights into the uncertainty structure of remotely sensed data, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods fall short. Specifically, we found that Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy outperformed Shannon entropy in capturing non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data. Moreover, our analysis highlights the potential of entropy-based methods for addressing issues related to data fusion, feature selection, and anomaly detection in remote sensing applications.

In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate batch algorithm, active belief propagation (ABP), for training LDA. Usually batch LDA algorithms require repeated scanning of the entire corpus and searching the complete topic space. To process massive corpora having a large number of topics, the training iteration of batch LDA algorithms is often inefficient and time-consuming. To accelerate the training speed, ABP actively scans the subset of corpus and searches the subset of topic space for topic modeling, therefore saves enormous training time in each iteration. To ensure accuracy, ABP selects only those documents and topics that contribute to the largest residuals within the residual belief propagation (RBP) framework. On four real-world corpora, ABP performs around $10$ to $100$ times faster than state-of-the-art batch LDA algorithms with a comparable topic modeling accuracy.", "machine_text": "In this study, we present a novel approach to accelerating topic modeling, a fundamental technique in natural language processing.

We assume that only a small subset of covariates is `active' (i.e., the corresponding coefficients are non-zero), and consider the model-selection problem of identifying the active covariates. A popular approach is to estimate the regression coefficients through the Lasso ($\\ell_1$-regularized least squares). This is known to correctly identify the active set only if the irrelevant covariates are roughly orthogonal to the relevant ones, as quantified through the so called `irrepresentability' condition. In this paper we study the `Gauss-Lasso' selector, a simple two-stage method that first solves the Lasso, and then performs ordinary least squares restricted to the Lasso active set. We formulate `generalized irrepresentability condition' (GIC), an assumption that is substantially weaker than irrepresentability.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of GIS through extensive simulations and real-data applications, showcasing its ability to achieve superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and feature selection accuracy.

However, extracting structural information that is perceptually important to our visual system is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by employing a sparse representation-based approach and proposes a new metric called the \\emph{sparse representation-based quality} (SPARQ) \\emph{index}. The proposed method learns the inherent structures of the reference image as a set of basis vectors, such that any structure in the image can be represented by a linear combination of only a few of those basis vectors. This sparse strategy is employed because it is known to generate basis vectors that are qualitatively similar to the receptive field of the simple cells present in the mammalian primary visual cortex. The visual quality of the distorted image is estimated by comparing the structures of the reference and the distorted images in terms of the learnt basis vectors resembling cortical cells. Our approach is evaluated on six publicly available subject-rated image quality assessment datasets. The proposed SPARQ index consistently exhibits high correlation with the subjective ratings on all datasets and performs better or at par with the state-of-the-art.", "machine_text": "In this work, we propose a novel image quality assessment (IQA) approach based on sparse representation.

Partial class memberships are not restricted to predictions, but may also occur in reference labels (ground truth, gold standard diagnosis) for training and validation data.   Classifier performance is usually expressed as fractions of the confusion matrix, such as sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values. We extend this concept to soft classification and discuss the bias and variance properties of the extended performance measures. Ambiguity in reference labels translates to differences between best-case, expected and worst-case performance. We show a second set of measures comparing expected and ideal performance which is closely related to regression performance, namely the root mean squared error RMSE and the mean absolute error MAE.   All calculations apply to classical crisp classification as well as to soft classification (partial class memberships and/or one-class classifiers). The proposed performance measures allow to test classifiers with actual borderline cases. In addition, hardening of e.g. posterior probabilities into class labels is not necessary, avoiding the corresponding information loss and increase in variance.   We implement the proposed performance measures in the R package \"softclassval\", which is available from CRAN and at http://softclassval.r-forge.r-project.org.   Our reasoning as well as the importance of partial memberships for chemometric classification is illustrated by a real-word application: astrocytoma brain tumor tissue grading (80 patients, 37000 spectra) for finding surgical excision borders.

While the most common maximum a posteriori (MAP), or Viterbi, path estimator and the minimum error, or Posterior Decoder (PD), have long been around, other path estimators, or decoders, have been either only hinted at or applied more recently and in dedicated applications generally unfamiliar to the statistical learning community. Over a decade ago, however, a family of algorithmically defined decoders aiming to hybridize the two standard ones was proposed (Brushe et al., 1998). The present paper gives a careful analysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues with it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical resolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical criteria for hidden path recognition are shown to lead to a new class of decoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual forward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of such estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators. Similar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized by a small number of tunable parameters. Unlike their algorithmic predecessors, the new risk-based decoders are more clearly interpretable, and, most importantly, work \"out of the box\" in practice, which is demonstrated on some real bioinformatics tasks and data. Some further generalizations and applications are discussed in conclusion.", "machine_text": "We introduce a generalized risk approach to path inference based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). This approach addresses the problem of estimating the most likely path of a system given a sequence of observations, where the system's behavior is modeled as a hidden Markov process.

We then use this risk function to guide the path inference process, selecting the path that minimizes the risk. Our approach is flexible and can be applied to various domains, including speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance.

Since then, several algorithms have been designed to handle this subclass of NMF problems.

In the proposed approach we use a grammar for the composition of covariance functions and genetic programming to search over the space of sentences that can be derived from the grammar. We tested the proposed approach on synthetic data from two-dimensional test functions, and on the Mauna Loa CO2 time series.

This paper presents a video face recognition system based on probabilistic Multi-Region Histograms to characterise performance trade-offs in: (i) selecting a subset of faces compared to using all faces, and (ii) combining information from all faces via clustering. Three face selection metrics are evaluated for choosing a subset: face detection confidence, random subset, and sequential selection. Experiments on the recently introduced MOBIO dataset indicate that the usage of all faces through clustering always outperformed selecting only a subset of faces. The experiments also show that the face selection metric based on face detection confidence generally provides better recognition performance than random or sequential sampling. Moreover, the optimal number of faces varies drastically across selection metric and subsets of MOBIO. Given the trade-offs between computational effort, recognition accuracy and robustness, it is recommended that face feature clustering would be most advantageous in batch processing (particularly for video-based watchlists), whereas face selection methods should be limited to applications with significant computational restrictions.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to video face matching using subset selection and clustering of probabilistic multi-region histograms.

Using a MCMC analysis to sample the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters, we find that Planck will have biases of -0.7, -0.3 and -0.4 sigmas for n_S, Omega_b h2 and log(As), respectively, in the minimal 6-parameter LCDM model, if the description of the recombination history given by RICO is not used. The remaining parameters are not significantly affected. We also show, that the cosmology dependence of the corrections to the recombination history modeled with RICO has a negligible impact on the posterior distributions obtained for the case of the Planck satellite. In practice, this implies that the inclusion of additional corrections to existing recombination codes can be achieved using simple cosmology-independent `fudge functions'. Finally, we also investigated the impact of some recent improvements in the treatment of hydrogen recombination which are still not included in the current version of our training set for Rico, by assuming that the cosmology dependence of those corrections can be neglected. In summary, with our current understanding of the complete recombination process, the expected biases in the cosmological parameters inferred from Planck might be as large as -2.3, -1.7 and -1 sigmas for n_S, Omega_b h2 and log(As) respectively, if all those corrections are not taken into account.

Our results indicate that recombination uncertainties can lead to significant shifts in the best-fit parameter values, with the Hubble constant varying by up to 1.5% and the dark matter density by up to 2.5%. We also find that these uncertainties can affect the derived parameters of other cosmological models, such as the Planck and \u039bCDM models. Our work highlights the importance of accurately modeling recombination in CMB experiments and underscores the need for further studies to refine our understanding of this process.

This arises naturally in allocation problems which have been studied extensively in the literature, albeit in the absence of delays in the feedback. We study this problem in the Bayesian setting. In presence of delays, no solution with provable guarantees is known to exist with sub-exponential running time.   We show that bandit problems with delayed feedback that arise in allocation settings can be forced to have significant structure, with a slight loss in optimality. This structure gives us the ability to reason about the relationship of single arm policies to the entangled optimum policy, and eventually leads to a O(1) approximation for a significantly general class of priors. The structural insights we develop are of key interest and carry over to the setting where the feedback of an action is available instantaneously, and we improve all previous results in this setting as well.", "machine_text": "We investigate the multiarmed bandit problem with delayed feedback, where an agent must select one of multiple arms in each round and receive delayed feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of 3D object motion and viewpoint change, self-occlusions and dis-occlusions of the object are prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are unable to adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a joint shape and appearance tracking framework.   Self-occlusions and the warp to propagate the template are coupled, thus a joint problem is formulated. We derive a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme, advantageous in object tracking, that initially perturbs the template by coarse perturbations before transitioning to finer-scale perturbations, traversing all scales, seamlessly and automatically. The scheme is a gradient descent on a novel infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold that we introduce. The manifold consists of planar parameterized regions, and the metric that we introduce is a novel Sobolev-type metric defined on infinitesimal vector fields on regions. The metric has the property of resulting in a gradient descent that automatically favors coarse-scale deformations (when they reduce the energy) before moving to finer-scale deformations.

The proposed system uses Gabor filter banks for characterization of facial features by spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation to make compensate to the variations of face instances occurred due to illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter bank to face images produces Gabor face representations with high dimensional feature vectors.

Rational decision making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete together with some intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make decisions. In bounded rationality, this decision is made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect and that the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of flexibly-bounded rationality, advanced information analysis is used, the correlation machine is applied to complete missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions. Therefore flexibly-bounded rationality expands the bounds within which rationality is exercised. Because human decision making is essentially irrational, this paper proposes the theory of marginalization of irrationality in decision making to deal with the problem of satisficing in the presence of irrationality.", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the theoretical foundations of decision making under uncertainty, where we introduce the concept of flexibly-bounded rationality.

We compare the pruning method to the traditional rollback method for decision trees and game trees.

The scoring metric takes a network structure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring metric. Our contributions are threefold. First, we identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parameter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowledge. In particular, a user can express her knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain. Second, we describe local search and annealing algorithms to be used in conjunction with scoring metrics. In the special case where each node has at most one parent, we show that heuristic search can be replaced with a polynomial algorithm to identify the networks with the highest score.

Here we show that another global transformation of lensing mass distributions exists which almost leaves image positions and flux ratios invariant, and of which the MST is a special case. Whereas for axi-symmetric lenses this source position transformation exactly reproduces all strong lensing observables, it does so only approximately for more general lens situations. We provide crude estimates for the accuracy with which the transformed mass distribution can reproduce the same image positions as the original lens model, and present an illustrative example of its performance.

To quantify this effect, we employ a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, leveraging the software package GLAFIC and the GalPyan formalism. Our results show that the source-position transformation is significant for sources within a few arcseconds of the lensing galaxy's center, but decreases rapidly with increasing distance. This discovery has important implications for the interpretation of strong lensing observations and the recovery of source properties from lensed images. We discuss the potential applications of our findings in the context of galaxy evolution, dark matter, and cosmology.    "}

Although the problem of handwriting recognition has been considered for more than 60 years there are still many open issues, especially in the task of unconstrained handwritten sentence recognition. This paper focuses on the automatic system that recognizes continuous English sentence through a mouse-based gestures in real-time based on Artificial Neural Network. The proposed Artificial Neural Network is trained using the traditional backpropagation algorithm for self supervised neural network which provides the system with great learning ability and thus has proven highly successful in training for feed-forward Artificial Neural Network. The designed algorithm is not only capable of translating discrete gesture moves, but also continuous gestures through the mouse. In this paper we are using the efficient neural network approach for recognizing English sentence drawn by mouse. This approach shows an efficient way of extracting the boundary of the English Sentence and specifies the area of the recognition English sentence where it has been drawn in an image and then used Artificial Neural Network to recognize the English sentence.

We utilize a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANN to classify the recognized gestures into corresponding English sentences. Our experimental results demonstrate an accuracy rate of 85.7% in recognizing sentences with a maximum of 5 words, outperforming traditional gesture recognition methods. We also investigate the impact of gesture duration, velocity, and mouse position on the recognition accuracy, revealing that gesture duration and velocity have a significant effect on the system's performance.

Greater accuracy will require incorporation of prior structural information on data into learning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised regularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating functions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors using Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\\bf R}^n$. A feature vector ${\\bf x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\{x_q\\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a function of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its structure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous to those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on the set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from function denoising on ${\\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the denoising (regularization) parameter $\\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the noise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction accuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\\alpha$ in index spaces with graph structures. We adapt two standard function denoising methods used on ${\\bf R}^n$, local averaging and kernel regression. In general the index space can be any discrete set with a notion of proximity, e.g. a metric space, a subset of ${\\bf R}^n$, or a graph/network, with feature vectors as functions with some notion of continuity. We show this improves feature vector recovery, and thus the subsequent classification or regression done on them. We give an example in gene expression analysis for cancer classification with the genome as an index space and network structure based protein-protein interactions.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel regularization technique for feature vectors in machine learning, which we term feature vector regularization (FVR). FVR is designed to address the issue of overfitting in feature-based models, where feature vectors are prone to memorizing the training data rather than generalizing to new instances. By incorporating FVR into the training process, we demonstrate significant improvements in model robustness and generalizability. Our methodology involves adding a regularization term to the loss function, which penalizes feature vectors that deviate significantly from a predefined distribution. We evaluate FVR on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing overfitting and improving model performance. Furthermore, we provide insights into the impact of FVR on feature vector representation and its relationship with model interpretability. Our results show that FVR can be used in conjunction with existing regularization techniques to achieve even better performance, making it a valuable addition to the machine learning toolkit. "}
