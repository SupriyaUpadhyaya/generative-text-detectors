In this paper, we present a three-dimensional domain decomposition scheme for enabling large-scale electronic calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) on massively parallel computers. It is composed of two methods: (i) atom decomposition method and (ii) grid decomposition method. In the former, we develop a modified recursive bisection method based on inertia tensor moment to reorder the atoms along a principal axis so that atoms that are close in real space are also close on the axis to ensure data locality. The atoms are then divided into sub-domains depending on their projections onto the principal axis in a balanced way among the processes. In the latter, we define four data structures for the partitioning of grids that are carefully constructed to make data locality consistent with that of the clustered atoms for minimizing data communications between the processes. We also propose a decomposition method for solving the Poisson equation using three-dimensional FFT in Hartree potential calculation, which is shown to be better than a previously proposed parallelization method based on a two-dimensional decomposition in terms of communication efficiency. For evaluation, we perform benchmark calculations with our open-source DFT code, OpenMX, paying particular attention to the O(N) Krylov subspace method.

Recent works achieve good performance by modeling errors into their objective functions to remove the errors from the inputs. However, these approaches face the limitations that the structure of errors should be known prior and a complex convex problem must be solved. In this paper, we present a novel method to eliminate the effects of the errors from the projection space (representation) rather than from the input space. We first prove that $\\ell_1$-, $\\ell_2$-, $\\ell_{\\infty}$-, and nuclear-norm based linear projection spaces share the property of Intra-subspace Projection Dominance (IPD), i.e., the coefficients over intra-subspace data points are larger than those over inter-subspace data points. Based on this property, we introduce a method to construct a sparse similarity graph, called L2-Graph. The subspace clustering and subspace learning algorithms are developed upon L2-Graph.

The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global sensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we take advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to quantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and a hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to transform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets including those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of the query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in H) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be inaccurate.   We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of answering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of a graph and a labeling of its vertices. In particular, while our generic procedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as graphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using different projection-based techniques. We then analyze two important query classes: subgraph counting queries (e.g., number of triangles) and local profile queries (e.g., number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist who know each other). We demonstrate that the restricted sensitivity of such queries can be significantly lower than their smooth sensitivity.

Capabilities of these two architectures were compared and verified in solving human face recognition, which is a complex pattern recognition task where several factors affect the recognition performance like pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. Both the structures were implemented and tested for face recognition purpose and experimental results show that the OCON structure performs better than the generally used ACON ones in term of training convergence speed of the network.

Our formalism is applicable to any biasing scheme which is local in Lagrangian space, including the halo bias as a special case. Weakly nonlinear effects on halo clustering in redshift space are analytically given.We assume only a fundamental idea of the halo model: haloes form according to the extended Press-Schechter theory, and the spatial distributions are locally biased in Lagrangian space. There is no need for assuming the spherical collapse model to follow the dynamical evolution, which is additionally assumed in standard halo prescriptions. One-loop corrections to the power spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are explicitly derived and presented. Instead of relying on expensive numerical simulations, our approach provides an analytic way of investigating the weakly nonlinear effects, simultaneously including the nonlinear biasing and nonlinear redshift-space distortions. Nonlinearity introduces a weak scale dependence in the halo bias.

The maximal discrepancy occurs at k ~ 1 hMpc-1, and is at the level of 10% of the total suppression. Most published constraints on neutrino masses based on HALOFIT are not affected, as they rely on data probing the matter power spectrum in the linear or mildly non-linear regime.

The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction-which can vary drastically across eatures. We decrease this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space.

Instead, the environment's impact on the agents in the network is seen through a sequence of cost functions, revealed to the agents in a causal manner only after all the relevant actions are taken. There are two kinds of costs: individual costs incurred by each agent and local-interaction costs incurred by each agent and its neighbors in the social network. Moreover, agents have inertia: each agent has a default mixed strategy that stays fixed regardless of the state of the environment, and must expend effort to deviate from this strategy in order to respond to cost signals coming from the environment. We construct a decentralized strategy, wherein each agent selects its action based only on the costs directly affecting it and on the decisions made by its neighbors in the network. In this setting, we quantify social learning in terms of regret, which is given by the difference between the realized network performance over a given time horizon and the best performance that could have been achieved in hindsight by a fictitious centralized entity with full knowledge of the environment's evolution.

We compare the multivariate Bernoulli model with existing graphical inference models - the Ising model and the multivariate Gaussian model, where only the pairwise interactions are considered. On the other hand, the multivariate Bernoulli distribution has an interesting property in that independence and uncorrelatedness of the component random variables are equivalent. Both the marginal and conditional distributions of a subset of variables in the multivariate Bernoulli distribution still follow the multivariate Bernoulli distribution. Furthermore, the multivariate Bernoulli logistic model is developed under generalized linear model theory by utilizing the canonical link function in order to include covariate information on the nodes, edges and cliques.

We examine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of solutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated that a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but noisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron firing probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small perturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this estimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is small. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very general settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the estimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in reinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating this unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a biased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of the gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of the gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold, but like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is similar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many inputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be convenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and sparse gradients.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel framework for estimating or propagating gradients through stochastic neurons in deep neural networks.

Segmentation plays an important role in chromosome karyotyping. The first step in segmentation is to remove intrusive objects such as stain debris and other noises. The next step is detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes, and the final step is separation of such chromosomes. Common methods for separation between touching chromosomes are interactive and require human intervention for correct separation between touching and overlapping chromosomes. In this paper, a geometric-based method is used for automatic detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes and separating them. The proposed scheme performs segmentation in two phases. In the first phase, chromosome clusters are detected using three geometric criteria, and in the second phase, chromosome clusters are separated using a cut-line. Most of earlier methods did not work properly in case of chromosome clusters that contained more than two chromosomes. Our method, on the other hand, is quite efficient in separation of such chromosome clusters. At each step, one separation will be performed and this algorithm is repeated until all individual chromosomes are separated. Another important point about the proposed method is that it uses the geometric features of chromosomes which are independent of the type of images and it can easily be applied to any type of images such as binary images and does not require multispectral images as well.

Many times networks over which contagions diffuse are unobserved and need to be inferred. Here we apply survival theory to develop general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel framework for modeling information propagation using survival theory, addressing the long-standing challenge of accurately predicting the spread of information in complex networks.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIP through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showcasing improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. Our results indicate that incorporating survival theory enables better understanding of information propagation patterns, allowing for more accurate forecasting and strategic decision-making in various applications, including social media, marketing, and epidemiology.

The third term is a data fidelity term, allowing us to incorporate prior information into the model in a semi-supervised framework.

The imaging survey is augmented by an extensive spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the SNe, and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations.

Our approach is based on a blockwise SURE estimation, which adaptively adjusts the number of nearest neighbors for each block of the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, showcasing improved denoising performance and preservation of image details compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We show that there is a similar problem with default \"proof by cases\" and construct a setting where we might draw a different conclusion knowing a disjunction than we would knowing any particular disjunct. Though Reiter's original formalism is capable of representing this distinction, other approaches are not. To represent and reason about this case, default logicians must specify how a \"typical\" individual is selected. The problem is closely related to Simpson's paradox of probability theory. If we accept a simple probabilistic account of defaults based on the notion that one proposition may favour or increase belief in another, the \"multiple extension problem\" for both conjunctive and disjunctive knowledge vanishes.", "machine_text": "We investigate the problem of conditioning on disjunctive knowledge, where an agent has probabilistic knowledge about the disjunction of multiple events.

The polarization curves that evaluate the corrosion kinetics of electrodes in corrosive media are an application where the behavior is chiefly analyzed from profiles. Polarization curves are indeed a classic method to determine the global kinetics of metallic electrodes, but the strong nonlinearity from different metals and alloys can overlap and the discrimination becomes a challenging problem. Moreover, even finding a typical curve from replicated tests requires subjective judgement. In this paper we used the so-called multi-q approach based on the Tsallis statistics in a classification engine to separate multiple polarization curve profiles of two stainless steels. We collected 48 experimental polarization curves in aqueous chloride medium of two stainless steel types, with different resistance against localized corrosion. Multi-q pattern analysis was then carried out on a wide potential range, from cathodic up to anodic regions. An excellent classification rate was obtained, at a success rate of 90%, 80%, and 83% for low (cathodic), high (anodic), and both potential ranges, respectively, using only 2% of the original profile data.

A modern approach to improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators.

The Fisher information matrix is positive definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable.

The present paper applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the posterior distribution.

We demonstrate how directed information quantifies Granger causality in a particular sequential prediction setting.

One algorithm assumes upper-bounds on the degrees and uses the minimal dimension statistics necessary. In the event that the upper-bounds are not valid, the resulting graph is nonetheless an optimal approximation. Another algorithm uses near-minimal dimension statistics when no bounds are known but the distribution satisfies a certain criterion. Analogous to how structure learning algorithms for undirected graphical models use mutual information estimates, these algorithms use directed information estimates. We characterize the sample-complexity of two plug-in directed information estimators and obtain confidence intervals.

Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a \"similarity distance\" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound on the difference between the respective expected payoffs.

One of the most frequent defects in astronomical imaging is the presence of additive noise which makes a denoising step mandatory before processing data. During the last decade, a particular modeling scheme, based on sparse representations, has drawn the attention of an ever growing community of researchers. Sparse representations offer a promising framework to many image and signal processing tasks, especially denoising and restoration applications. At first, the harmonics, wavelets, and similar bases and overcomplete representations have been considered as candidate domains to seek the sparsest representation. A new generation of algorithms, based on data-driven dictionaries, evolved rapidly and compete now with the off-the-shelf fixed dictionaries. While designing a dictionary beforehand leans on a guess of the most appropriate representative elementary forms and functions, the dictionary learning framework offers to construct the dictionary upon the data themselves, which provides us with a more flexible setup to sparse modeling and allows to build more sophisticated dictionaries. In this paper, we introduce the Centered Dictionary Learning (CDL) method and we study its performances for astronomical image denoising. We show how CDL outperforms wavelet or classic dictionary learning denoising techniques on astronomical images, and we give a comparison of the effect of these different algorithms on the photometry of the denoised images.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to astronomical image denoising using dictionary learning.

This technique, called \"walling-in\", is a vital part of player's skill set, allowing him to survive early aggression. However, current artificial players (bots) do not possess this skill, due to numerous inconveniences surfacing during its implementation in imperative languages like C++ or Java. In this text, written as a guide for bot programmers, we address the problem of finding an appropriate building placement that would block the entrance to player's base, and present a ready to use declarative solution employing the paradigm of answer set programming (ASP). We also encourage the readers to experiment with different declarative approaches to this problem.", "machine_text": "We designed and implemented a declarative programming approach to place buildings in StarCraft, a popular real-time strategy game. Our method, Wall-In Building Placement (WIBP), leverages the game's map geometry and building placement constraints to automatically generate optimal building placements. We formulated the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and employed a declarative programming language, CLP(R), to solve it. Our results show that WIBP outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of building placement quality and efficiency. In particular, WIBP achieves an average improvement of 12.5% in building placement quality and reduces the computation time by 35.6% compared to the baseline method. The key idea behind WIBP is to represent the building placement problem as a CSP, which allows us to declaratively specify the constraints and objectives. We also developed a novel algorithm, the Wall-In Algorithm, to efficiently solve the CSP and generate building placements. Our approach has the potential to be applied to other real-time strategy games and can contribute to the development of more effective and efficient building placement techniques. "}

Unfortunately, the presence of speckle noise in these images affects edges and fine details which limit the contrast resolution and make diagnostic more difficult. In this paper, we propose a denoising approach which combines logarithmic transformation and a non linear diffusion tensor. Since speckle noise is multiplicative and nonwhite process, the logarithmic transformation is a reasonable choice to convert signaldependent or pure multiplicative noise to an additive one. The key idea from using diffusion tensor is to adapt the flow diffusion towards the local orientation by applying anisotropic diffusion along the coherent structure direction of interesting features in the image.

Moreover, previous investigations have mainly focused on its empirical aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a formal definition of the algorithm, as well as to perform runtime analyses to revealits theoretical aspects. In this paper, we define the deterministic version of the DCA, named the dDCA, using set theory and mathematical functions. Runtime analyses of the standard algorithm and the one with additional segmentation are performed. Our analysis suggests that the standard dDCA has a runtime complexity of O(n2) for the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of input data instances. The introduction of segmentation changes the algorithm's worst case runtime complexity to O(max(nN; nz)), for DC population size N with size of each segment z. Finally, two runtime variables of the algorithm are formulated based on the input data, to understand its runtime behaviour as guidelines for further development.", "machine_text": "We present a theoretical formulation and analysis of the deterministic dendritic cell algorithm, a novel optimization technique inspired by the behavior of dendritic cells in the human immune system.

Focusing on non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the early stopping strategy for a form of gradient-descent applied to the least-squares loss function. We propose a data-dependent stopping rule that does not involve hold-out or cross-validation data, and we prove upper bounds on the squared error of the resulting function estimate, measured in either the $L^2(P)$ and $L^2(P_n)$ norm. These upper bounds lead to minimax-optimal rates for various kernel classes, including Sobolev smoothness classes and other forms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show through simulation that our stopping rule compares favorably to two other stopping rules, one based on hold-out data and the other based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate.

In default inference, some extensions seem to be simply wrong and we use qualitative techniques to weed out the unwanted ones. In the area of diagnosis, however, the multiple explanations may all seem reasonable, however improbable. Choosing among them is a matter of quantitative preference. Quantitative preference works well in diagnosis when knowledge is modelled causally. Here we suggest a framework that combines probabilities and defaults in a single unified framework that retains the semantics of diagnosis as construction of explanations from a fixed set of possible hypotheses. We can then compute probabilities incrementally as we construct explanations.

In short, a user searching for a target object navigates through a database in the following manner: the user is asked to select the object most similar to her target from a small list of objects. A new object list is then presented to the user based on her earlier selection. This process is repeated until the target is included in the list presented, at which point the search terminates. This problem is known to be strongly related to the small-world network design problem.   However, contrary to prior work, which focuses on cases where objects in the database are equally popular, we consider here the case where the demand for objects may be heterogeneous. We show that, under heterogeneous demand, the small-world network design problem is NP-hard. Given the above negative result, we propose a novel mechanism for small-world design and provide an upper bound on its performance under heterogeneous demand. The above mechanism has a natural equivalent in the context of content search through comparisons, and we establish both an upper bound and a lower bound for the performance of this mechanism. These bounds are intuitively appealing, as they depend on the entropy of the demand as well as its doubling constant, a quantity capturing the topology of the set of target objects. They also illustrate interesting connections between comparison-based search to classic results from information theory.

Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such systems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an appropriate manner, e.g. majority voting.   In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our algorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation, significantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through comparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we compare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can dynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the next arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a target reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and non-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under both scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and can not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that building a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing the potential of adaptive designs.", "machine_text": "We present a novel approach to budget-optimal task allocation for reliable crowdsourcing systems.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, showing that it achieves significant cost savings while maintaining high task reliability. Our results also highlight the importance of considering worker reliability in task allocation, as ignoring this factor can lead to significant decreases in system reliability. By incorporating worker reliability into the allocation process, we show that our approach can improve task completion rates by up to 25% compared to traditional methods.

We develop a set of logical operators that allow us to combine these formulas in a way that respects the principles of social choice theory.

It is not completely clear whether the selected individual is part of the five, so this could actually allude to distance five or six in the language of graph theory, but the \"six degrees of separation\" phrase stuck after John Guare's 1990 eponymous play. Following Milgram's definition and Guare's interpretation, we will assume that \"degrees of separation\" is the same as \"distance minus one\", where \"distance\" is the usual path length-the number of arcs in the path.) Stanley Milgram in his famous experiment challenged people to route postcards to a fixed recipient by passing them only through direct acquaintances. The average number of intermediaries on the path of the postcards lay between 4.4 and 5.7, depending on the sample of people chosen.   We report the results of the first world-scale social-network graph-distance computations, using the entire Facebook network of active users (\\approx721 million users, \\approx69 billion friendship links). The average distance we observe is 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 intermediaries or \"degrees of separation\", showing that the world is even smaller than we expected, and prompting the title of this paper. More generally, we study the distance distribution of Facebook and of some interesting geographic subgraphs, looking also at their evolution over time.

Molecular dynamics simulations can provide complementary information, but exploration of the space of possible configurations is often hindered by large barriers in phase space that separate metastable regions. To solve this problem, enhanced sampling methods have been developed that divide a phase space into regions and integrate trajectory segments in each region. These methods boost the probability of passage over barriers, and facilitate parallelization since integration of the trajectory segments does not require communication, aside from their initialization and termination. Here we present a parallel version of an enhanced sampling method suitable for systems driven far from equilibrium: nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS). We apply this method to a coarse-grained model of a 262-nucleotide RNA molecule that unfolds and refolds in an explicit flow field modeled with stochastic rotation dynamics. Using NEUS we are able to observe extremely rare unfolding events that have mean first passage times as long as 1.4 s (3.4 E13 dynamics steps). We examine the unfolding process for a range of flow rates of the medium, and we describe two competing pathways in which different intramolecular contacts are broken.", "machine_text": "We employed nonequilibrium umbrella sampling to investigate the flow-dependent unfolding and refolding of a model RNA hairpin. We addressed the fundamental question of how fluid flow affects the conformational dynamics of RNA molecules, which is crucial for understanding RNA-protein interactions and gene regulation. By applying a constant flow rate to the RNA hairpin, we observed a striking dependence of the unfolding and refolding kinetics on the flow velocity. Our simulations revealed that the flow-induced shear stress triggers a rapid unfolding of the RNA hairpin, followed by a slow refolding process. We demonstrated that the unfolding and refolding rates are strongly correlated with the flow velocity, suggesting a mechanistic link between the flow-induced stress and the RNA conformational dynamics. Furthermore, our results show that the flow-dependent unfolding and refolding are influenced by the RNA's secondary structure and the flow-induced deformation of the RNA molecule. Our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between fluid flow, RNA structure, and function, and highlights the potential of nonequilibrium umbrella sampling as a powerful tool for investigating the flow-dependent dynamics of RNA molecules.

In accordance with our motivating applications, we consider the fairly broad class of constraint satisfaction problems, and assume that errors are signaled by a verification oracle in the format of the index of a violated constraint (with the content of the constraint still hidden).   Our discoveries are summarized as follows. On one hand, despite the seemingly very little information provided by the verification oracle, efficient algorithms do exist for a number of important problems. For the Nash, Core, Stable Matching, and SAT problems, the unknown-input versions are as hard as the corresponding known-input versions, up to a factor of polynomial. We further give almost tight bounds on the latter two problems' trial complexities. On the other hand, there are problems whose complexities are substantially increased in the unknown-input model. In particular, no time-efficient algorithms exist (under standard hardness assumptions) for Graph Isomorphism and Group Isomorphism problems. The tools used to achieve these results include order theory, strong ellipsoid method, and some non-standard reductions.

The existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It suffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover, introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more general convex programs.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty for low-rank representation.

By leveraging semantic technologies, we integrate ontologies and natural language processing to enhance the composition process. Our approach involves modeling web services as complex networks, where nodes represent services and edges represent interactions between them. We analyze the network structure and properties to identify optimal service compositions, taking into account factors such as service dependencies, semantic similarity, and network centrality.

The central idea is to assign a probability distribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that is, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that, under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This probability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many, preferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second distance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the resistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for computing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator. Experimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network measures.", "machine_text": "We propose a bag-of-paths framework for network data analysis, which enables the efficient and scalable extraction of meaningful patterns and relationships from complex network data. Our framework addresses the problem of identifying key nodes and paths in networks, which is crucial for understanding the structure and behavior of complex systems.

Our approach leverages the concept of 'path similarity' to identify paths that are similar in terms of their structure and content, and then selects the most representative critical paths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments on real-world network data, including social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks.

Specifically, in many applications $\\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of samples obtained from an unknown probability distribution $\\pi$ on transactions, and by extracting the FIs in $\\mathcal{D}$ one attempts to infer itemsets that are frequently (i.e., with probability at least $\\theta$) generated by $\\pi$, which we call the True Frequent Itemsets (TFIs). Due to the inherently stochastic nature of the generative process, the set of FIs is only a rough approximation of the set of TFIs, as it often contains a huge number of \\emph{false positives}, i.e., spurious itemsets that are not among the TFIs. In this work we design and analyze an algorithm to identify a threshold $\\hat{\\theta}$ such that the collection of itemsets with frequency at least $\\hat{\\theta}$ in $\\mathcal{D}$ contains only TFIs with probability at least $1-\\delta$, for some user-specified $\\delta$. Our method uses results from statistical learning theory involving the (empirical) VC-dimension of the problem at hand.

The algorithm uses the weak Euler approximation far from barriers and a special construction motivated by linear interpolation of the price near barriers. It is easy to implement and is universal: it can be applied to various structures of the contracts including derivatives on multi-asset correlated underlyings and can deal with various type of barriers. In contrast to the Brownian bridge techniques currently commonly used for pricing barrier options, the algorithm tested here does not require knowledge of trigger probabilities nor their estimates.

An n-player game is given by an undirected graph on n nodes and a set of n local matrices. The interpretation is that the payoff to player i is determined entirely by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and thus the payoff matrix to player i is indexed only by these players. We thus view the global n-player game as being composed of interacting local games, each involving many fewer players. Each player's action may have global impact, but it occurs through the propagation of local influences.Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibria when the underlying graph is a tree (or can be turned into a tree with few node mergings). The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the representation (the graph and theassociated local game matrices), and comes in two related but distinct flavors. The first version involves an approximation step, and computes a representation of all approximate Nash equilibria (of which there may be an exponential number in general). The second version allows the exact computation of Nash equilibria at the expense of weakened complexity bounds. The algorithm requires only local message-passing between nodes (and thus can be implemented by the players themselves in a distributed manner). Despite an analogy to inference in Bayes nets that we develop, the analysis of our algorithm is more involved than that for the polytree algorithm in, owing partially to the fact that we must either compute, or select from, an exponential number of potential solutions. We discuss a number of extensions, such as the computation of equilibria with desirable global properties (e.g. maximizing global return), and directions for further research.", "machine_text": "We introduce a novel framework for game theory based on graphical models.

The structured heap queue scales gracefully with the number of events, allowing the efficient implementation of large scale digital hardware event-driven SNNs. The scaling is linear for memory, logarithmic for logic resources and constant for processing time. The use of the structured heap queue is demonstrated on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with an image segmentation experiment and a SNN of 65~536 neurons and 513~184 synapses.

This critique is known as the \"coupling-constitution fallacy\". In this paper we respond to this reductionist challenge by using an evolutionary robotics approach to create a minimal model of two acoustically coupled agents. We demonstrate how the interaction process as a whole has properties that cannot be reduced to the contributions of the isolated agents. We also show that the neural dynamics of the coupled agents has formal properties that are inherently impossible for those neural networks in isolation.

Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses.

Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies.

Under these conditions, we stress the importance of considering the expected costs and benefits of applying alternative approximation procedures and heuristics for computation and knowledge acquisition. We discuss how knowledge about the structure of user utility can be used to control value tradeoffs for tailoring inference to alternative contexts.

The parameter r unifies PCA and 2DPCA. r = 1 produces the covariance of 2DPCA, r = n that of PCA.

We particularly point out that a CS-based compression scheme is flexible enough to account for such information. In this context, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and data processing are merged. We show also that CS provides a new fantastic way to handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover information at very low signal-to-noise ratio, which is impossible with standard compression methods.

The quadrotor UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts; each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem.

A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\\SE$ for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global in each case.

Our solution shows that decoherence affects the relaxation of observables more than predicted by single-particle considerations.

We derive the exact solution for the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system, which exhibits a crossover from a quantum coherent regime to a classical thermal regime as a function of the decoherence rate. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can significantly alter the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system, leading to a suppression of quantum fluctuations and a faster approach to thermal equilibrium.

In this paper, we present a method to attach affinity scores to the implicit labels of individual points in a clustering.

To unify these two tasks, we present a new sparse Bayesian approach for joint association study and disease diagnosis. In this approach, common latent features are extracted from different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict multiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression; in return, the disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships between the data sources. The sparse projection matrices not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of biomarkers related to the disease.

In this study we use a large volume high resolution N-body cosmological simulation (Bolshoi) together with three constrained simulations to statistically study this kinematics in the context of the LCDM. The comparison of the ensembles of simulated pairs with the observed LG at the 1-sigma level in the uncertainties has been done with respect to the radial and tangential velocities, the reduced orbital energy (e_tot), angular momentum (l_orb) and the dimensionless spin parameter, lambda. Our main results are: (i) the preferred radial and tangential velocities for pairs in LCDM are v_rad=-80+/-20 km/s, v_tan=50+/-10 km/s, (ii) pairs around that region are 3 to 13 times more common than pairs within the observational values, (iii) 15%to 24% of LG-like pairs in LCDM have energy and angular momentum consistent with observations while (iv) 9% to 13% of pairs in the same sample show similar values in the inferred dimensionless spin parameter. It follows that within current observational uncertainties the quasi-conserved quantities that characterize the orbit of the LG, i.e. e_tot, r_orb and lambda, do not challenge the standard LCDM model, but the model is in tension with regard to the actual values of the radial and tangential velocities.

We furthermore show that the non-linear (second order) contribution can be estimated either analytically or numerically, yielding readily applicable optimization algorithms. We demonstrate monotonic convergence for an optimization functional that is an eighth-degree polynomial in the states. For the 'standard' quantum control problem of a convex final-time functional, linear equations of motion and linear dependency of the Hamiltonian on the field, the second-order contribution is not required for monotonic convergence but can be used to speed up convergence.

Our approach integrates a probabilistic model of speaker-listener interactions with a community detection algorithm, allowing us to identify overlapping communities with high precision and recall. In a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SLPA on a range of real-world social network datasets, including online forums, social media platforms, and email networks. Our results show that SLPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting overlapping communities, particularly in networks with complex community structures.

Analyses of human language and the behavior of a range of non-human animal species have provided evidence for a common pattern underlying diverse behavioral phenomena: words follow Zipf's law of brevity (the tendency of more frequently used words to be shorter), and conformity to this general pattern has been seen in the behavior of a number of other animals. It has been argued that the presence of this law is a sign of efficient coding in the information theoretic sense. However, no strong direct connection has been demonstrated between the law and compression, the information theoretic principle of minimizing the expected length of a code. Here we show that minimizing the expected code length implies that the length of a word cannot increase as its frequency increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean code length or duration is significantly small in human language, and also in the behavior of other species in all cases where agreement with the law of brevity has been found. We argue that compression is a general principle of animal behavior, that reflects selection for efficiency of coding.", "machine_text": "In this study, we investigate the ubiquity of compression as a fundamental principle governing animal behavior.

To examine this phenomenon, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining field observations, experimental manipulations, and statistical analyses.

These features are usually generated by applying a given set of templates on labeled data, but improper templates may lead to degraded performance. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple template learning paradigm to learn structured prediction and the importance of each template simultaneously, so that hundreds of arbitrary templates could be added into the learning model without caution. This paradigm can be formulated as a special multiple kernel learning problem with exponential number of constraints. Then we introduce an efficient cutting plane algorithm to solve this problem in the primal, and its convergence is presented. We also evaluate the proposed learning paradigm on two widely-studied structured prediction tasks, \\emph{i.e.} sequence labeling and dependency parsing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms CRFs and Structural SVMs due to exploiting the importance of each template. Our complexity analysis and empirical results also show that our proposed method is more efficient than OnlineMKL on very sparse and high-dimensional data.

For such applications, overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that superior image reconstruction can be obtained through variable density sampling strategies that concentrate on lower frequencies. The wavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order wavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing theory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction guarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the so-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how correlated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar wavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly, so for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square power-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with near-optimal embedding dimensions. Consequently, the variable-density sampling strategy we provide allows for image reconstructions that are stable to sparsity defects and robust to measurement noise. Our results cover both reconstruction by $\\ell_1$-minimization and by total variation minimization. The local coherence framework developed in this paper should be of independent interest in sparse recovery problems more generally, as it implies that for optimal sparse recovery results, it suffices to have bounded \\emph{average} coherence from sensing basis to sparsity basis -- as opposed to bounded maximal coherence -- as long as the sampling strategy is adapted accordingly.", "machine_text": "We propose stable and robust sampling strategies for compressive imaging, addressing the fundamental challenge of limited measurement resources in inverse problems.

A key feature of our procedure is the online learning of dictionaries (using only the data itself) to sparsely model the background source, which facilitates its separation from the partially-known source. Our approach is applicable to source separation problems in various application domains; here, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach via simulation on a stylized audio source separation task.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel semi-blind source separation method that leverages sparse representations and online dictionary learning to effectively separate sources from mixed signals.

Unlike standard approaches, kLog does not represent a probability distribution directly. It is rather a language to perform kernel-based learning on expressive logical and relational representations. kLog allows users to specify learning problems declaratively. It builds on simple but powerful concepts: learning from interpretations, entity/relationship data modeling, logic programming, and deductive databases. Access by the kernel to the rich representation is mediated by a technique we call graphicalization: the relational representation is first transformed into a graph --- in particular, a grounded entity/relationship diagram. Subsequently, a choice of graph kernel defines the feature space. kLog supports mixed numerical and symbolic data, as well as background knowledge in the form of Prolog or Datalog programs as in inductive logic programming systems. The kLog framework can be applied to tackle the same range of tasks that has made statistical relational learning so popular, including classification, regression, multitask learning, and collective classification.

Although detailed analytical solutions describing the afterglow emission received by an on-axis observer during both the early and late phases of the outflow evolution exist, a calculation of the received flux during the intermediate phase and for an off-axis observer requires either a more simplified analytical model or direct numerical simulations of the outflow dynamics. In this paper we present light curves for off-axis observers covering the long-term evolution of the blast wave calculated from a high resolution two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulation using a synchrotron radiation model. We compare our results to earlier analytical work and calculate the consequence of the observer angle with respect to the jet axis both for the detection of orphan afterglows and for jet break fits to the observational data. We find that observable jet breaks can be delayed for up to several weeks for off-axis observers, potentially leading to overestimation of the beaming corrected total energy. When using our off-axis light curves to create synthetic Swift X-ray data, we find that jet breaks are likely to remain hidden in the data.

The approach is similar to Lin's concordance coefficient that rather focuses on estimating p(X = Y). In other words, if a variable X exhibits a minrelation to Y then, as X increases, Y is likely to increases too. However, on the contrary to concordance or correlation, the minrelation is not symmetric. More explicitly, if X decreases, little can be said on Y values (except that the uncertainty on Y actually increases).

Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed, strong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to regularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP estimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter settings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from non-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems, a number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian (VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading to better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function now involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex, function-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard Bayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism these methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and extensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the VB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very particular penalty/prior that couples the image, blur kernel, and noise level in a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics pertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, and scale-invariance that allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing implementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict criteria for choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps counter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes.

We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the \"six degrees of separation\" phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which \"your friends have more friends than you\". Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics.", "machine_text": "We present a comprehensive analysis of the Facebook social graph, revealing the intricate structure and dynamics of online social networks.

The best-known algorithm for general bipartite graphs (due to Hopcroft and Karp) takes time O(m\\sqrt{n}). In regular bipartite graphs, however, a matching is known to be computable in O(m) time (due to Cole, Ost and Schirra). In a recent line of work by Goel, Kapralov and Khanna the O(m) time algorithm was improved first to \\tilde O(min{m, n^{2.5}/d}) and then to \\tilde O(min{m, n^2/d}). It was also shown that the latter algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors among all algorithms that use non-adaptive uniform sampling to reduce the size of the graph as a first step.   In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a perfect matching in a d-regular graph and runs in O(n\\log n) time (both in expectation and with high probability). The algorithm performs an appropriately truncated random walk on a modified graph to successively find augmenting paths. Our algorithm may be viewed as using adaptive uniform sampling, and is thus able to bypass the limitations of (non-adaptive) uniform sampling established in earlier work. We also show that randomization is crucial for obtaining o(nd) time algorithms by establishing an \\Omega(nd) lower bound for any deterministic algorithm. Our techniques also give an algorithm that successively finds a matching in the support of a doubly stochastic matrix in expected time O(n\\log^2 n) time, with O(m) pre-processing time; this gives a simple O(m+mn\\log^2 n) time algorithm for finding the Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition of a doubly stochastic matrix.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the long-standing problem of efficiently finding perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs.

Our algorithm exploits the structural properties of these graphs to efficiently compute the necessary information and construct the perfect matching. The key innovation lies in the use of a recursive procedure that recursively solves smaller instances of the problem, allowing us to avoid the exponential blow-up inherent in traditional combinatorial approaches.

If the signal has a characteristic timescale relevant to future prediction, the memory can be a simple shift register---a moving window extending into the past, requiring storage resources that linearly grows with the timescale to be represented. However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the characteristic prediction-relevant timescale of the signal. Moreover, many naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale allowed by resource availability. Here we construct a fuzzy memory system that optimally sacrifices the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free fashion in order to represent prediction-relevant information from exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in time series forecasting of natural signals. When the available storage resources are limited, we suggest that a general purpose learner would be better off committing to such a fuzzy memory system.", "machine_text": "We introduce Optimally Fuzzy Temporal Memory, a novel framework that tackles the long-standing challenge of efficiently storing and retrieving temporal information.

This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for.

In online games, usually a human user competes with others, so the fairness of the game system to all users is of great importance not to lose interests of users on the game. Furthermore, the emergence and success of electronic sports (e-sports) and professional gaming which specially talented gamers compete with others draws more attention on whether they are competing in the fair environment.

But considering the fact that we can easily gather large amount of user behavior data on games, it seems potentially beneficial to make use of this data to aid making decisions on design problems of games. Actually, modern games do not aim to perfectly design the game at once: rather, they first release the game, and then monitor users' behavior to better balance the game.

Identifying such communities of nodes has proven to be a challenging task mainly due to a plethora of definitions of a community, intractability of algorithms, issues with evaluation and the lack of a reliable gold-standard ground-truth.   In this paper we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly state their group memberships. For example, in social networks nodes explicitly join various interest based social groups. We use such groups to define a reliable and robust notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of network communities correspond to ground-truth communities. We choose 13 commonly used structural definitions of network communities and examine their sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad-participation-ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that easily scales to networks with more than hundred million nodes. The proposed method achieves 30% relative improvement over current local clustering methods.", "machine_text": "We define and evaluate network communities based on ground-truth using a novel approach that integrates graph-based clustering and community detection algorithms.

Our results show that by leveraging ground-truth labels, we can improve community detection by up to 25% in terms of precision and up to 15% in terms of recall. Furthermore, our approach is scalable and efficient, allowing it to be applied to large-scale networks with millions of nodes and edges.

The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion channels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a differential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there have been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by Markov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised doubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain models.   We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two that describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former channel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its effect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously demonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of bundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not correctly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and elucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based SDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models of the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately approximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using SDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on electrically active cells.", "machine_text": "We investigate stochastic differential equation (SDE) models for ion channel noise in Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, a crucial aspect of neural signal processing.

We employ numerical methods to solve the SDEs and simulate the stochastic behavior of the ion channels. Our results demonstrate that the SDE models successfully capture the variability in neural activity, exhibiting increased fidelity and accuracy compared to traditional deterministic models. Furthermore, we show that the SDE models can reproduce the experimentally observed bursting behavior in Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, highlighting the importance of incorporating stochasticity in ion channel dynamics for a more comprehensive understanding of neural activity.

Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difficult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the WellSVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the WellSVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations.

A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of \"normal\" examples with only a small percentage of \"abnormal\" or \"interesting\" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes.

This difference is then added to the minority class instance to generate a new instance.

Indeed, we derive here a new Cram\\'er-Rao inequality for the estimation of a parameter, which involves a generalized form of Fisher information. This generalized Fisher information reduces to the standard Fisher information as a particular case. In the case of a translation parameter, the general Cram\\'er-Rao inequality leads to an inequality for distributions which is saturated by generalized $q$-Gaussian distributions. These generalized $q$-Gaussians are important in several areas of physics and mathematics. They are known to maximize the $q$-entropies subject to a moment constraint.

Furthermore, we show that simple adaptations of the KL-UCB algorithm are also optimal for specific classes of (possibly unbounded) rewards, including those generated from exponential families of distributions. A large-scale numerical study comparing KL-UCB with its main competitors (UCB, UCB2, UCB-Tuned, UCB-V, DMED) shows that KL-UCB is remarkably efficient and stable, including for short time horizons.

The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance.

In SRC, the testing image is coded as a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation fidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of the coding residual. Such a sparse coding model assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which may not be effective enough to describe the coding residual in practical FR systems. Meanwhile, the sparsity constraint on the coding coefficients makes SRC's computational cost very high. In this paper, we propose a new face coding model, namely regularized robust coding (RRC), which could robustly regress a given signal with regularized regression coefficients. By assuming that the coding residual and the coding coefficient are respectively independent and identically distributed, the RRC seeks for a maximum a posterior solution of the coding problem. An iteratively reweighted regularized robust coding (IR3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the RRC model efficiently. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate that the RRC is much more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art sparse representation based methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption, lighting and expression changes, etc.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to robust face recognition by introducing a regularized robust coding (RRC) framework.

We propose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the conditional dependencies between these distinct sparse local features.

Conditional correlations between these sparse features are first discovered (in the training phase), and subsequently exploited to bring about significant improvements in recognition rates.

In this paper we establish the consistency of an extended Bayesian information criterion for Gaussian graphical models in a scenario where both the number of variables p and the sample size n grow. Compared to earlier work on the regression case, our treatment allows for growth in the number of non-zero parameters in the true model, which is necessary in order to cover connected graphs.

This approach can increase ad efficacy for two main reasons: peers' affiliations reflect unobserved consumer characteristics, which are correlated along the social network; and the inclusion of social cues (i.e., peers' association with a brand) alongside ads affect responses via social influence processes. For these reasons, responses may be increased when multiple social signals are presented with ads, and when ads are affiliated with peers who are strong, rather than weak, ties.   We conduct two very large field experiments that identify the effect of social cues on consumer responses to ads, measured in terms of ad clicks and the formation of connections with the advertised entity. In the first experiment, we randomize the number of social cues present in word-of-mouth advertising, and measure how responses increase as a function of the number of cues. The second experiment examines the effect of augmenting traditional ad units with a minimal social cue (i.e., displaying a peer's affiliation below an ad in light grey text). On average, this cue causes significant increases in ad performance. Using a measurement of tie strength based on the total amount of communication between subjects and their peers, we show that these influence effects are greatest for strong ties.

They are precious for simplifying gradient images or, filling unwanted catchment basins, on which a subsequent watershed transform extracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as flooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights representing the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be modeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG each node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The edges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent regions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and each node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of the flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding may thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on both types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then show that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge weighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a ceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for the ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric distance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both nodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by using shortest path algorithms.

That is, we assume that the ratings matrix is generated by applying feature vectors to a low-rank matrix and the goal is to recover back the underlying matrix. Furthermore, we generalize the problem to that of low-rank matrix estimation using rank-1 measurements.

In many cases we only observe when a node copies information, makes a decision or becomes infected -- but the connectivity, transmission rates between nodes and transmission sources are unknown. Inferring the underlying dynamics is of outstanding interest since it enables forecasting, influencing and retarding infections, broadly construed. To this end, we model diffusion processes as discrete networks of continuous temporal processes occurring at different rates. Given cascade data -- observed infection times of nodes -- we infer the edges of the global diffusion network and estimate the transmission rates of each edge that best explain the observed data. The optimization problem is convex. The model naturally (without heuristics) imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. The problem decouples into a collection of independent smaller problems, thus scaling easily to networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm both recovers the edges of diffusion networks and accurately estimates their transmission rates from cascade data.", "machine_text": "We investigate the temporal dynamics of diffusion networks, where information spreads through interconnected nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diffusion process exhibits distinct phases, characterized by varying rates of information propagation. By employing a novel combination of graph theoretical and dynamical systems approaches, we uncover the underlying mechanisms governing these phases. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion process is driven by a non-trivial interplay between node connectivity, node activity, and temporal correlations. Specifically, we find that the early stages of diffusion are dominated by a rapid spread of information through densely connected nodes, whereas the later stages are characterized by a slower, more localized diffusion process. Furthermore, we identify a critical threshold for node activity, above which the diffusion process transitions from a slow to a fast regime. Our findings have important implications for understanding and controlling the spread of information in complex networks, and provide a foundation for developing more accurate models of diffusion dynamics.

In the case of SO(4) or SU(2) symmetry, our bounds severely constrain models of conformal technicolor. In N=1 superconformal theories, we place strong bounds on dim(Phi*Phi), where Phi is a chiral operator. These bounds asymptote to the line dim(Phi*Phi) <= 2 dim(Phi) near dim(Phi) ~ 1, forbidding positive anomalous dimensions in this region. We also place novel upper and lower bounds on OPE coefficients of protected operators in the Phi x Phi OPE. Finally, we find examples of lower bounds on central charges and flavor current two-point functions that scale with the size of global symmetry representations.

Following design principles from proof theory, bidirectional typing can be applied to many type constructs. The principles underlying a bidirectional approach to polymorphism, however, are less obvious.

Our algorithm, which is based on a novel combination of type inference and constraint solving, is able to efficiently and accurately typecheck higher-rank polymorphic functions. The key idea is to first infer the types of the functions involved in the higher-rank polymorphism, and then use constraint solving to ensure that these types are compatible with the expected types of the functions. Our algorithm is easy to implement, as it only requires a few lines of code, and is complete, as it can handle all possible cases of higher-rank polymorphism.

Associative classifiers are especially fit to applications where maximum accuracy is desired to a model for prediction. There are many domains such as medical where the maximum accuracy of the model is desired. Heart disease is a single largest cause of death in developed countries and one of the main contributors to disease burden in developing countries. Mortality data from the registrar general of India shows that heart disease are a major cause of death in India, and in Andhra Pradesh coronary heart disease cause about 30%of deaths in rural areas. Hence there is a need to develop a decision support system for predicting heart disease of a patient. In this paper we propose efficient associative classification algorithm using genetic approach for heart disease prediction. The main motivation for using genetic algorithm in the discovery of high level prediction rules is that the discovered rules are highly comprehensible, having high predictive accuracy and of high interestingness values. Experimental Results show that most of the classifier rules help in the best prediction of heart disease which even helps doctors in their diagnosis decisions.", "machine_text": "In this study, we designed and developed a novel heart disease prediction system using associative classification and genetic algorithm.

The goal is to obtain a network that explicitly reveals as much information regarding conditional independence as possible. The network is built incrementally adding one node at a time. The expert's information and a greedy heuristic that tries to keep the number of arcs added at each step to a minimum are used to guide the search for the next node to add. The probabilistic model is a predicate that can answer queries about independencies in the domain. In practice the model can be implemented in various ways. For example, the model could be a statistical independence test operating on empirical data or a deductive prover operating on a set of independence statements about the domain.", "machine_text": "We present an automated approach for constructing sparse Bayesian networks from unstructured probabilistic models and domain information. Our method addresses the problem of transforming complex, high-dimensional probabilistic models into interpretable and computationally efficient Bayesian networks. We leverage domain knowledge and probabilistic inference techniques to identify relevant variables and their conditional dependencies, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the model and enhancing its scalability. Our approach consists of two phases: first, we employ a novel probabilistic clustering algorithm to identify clusters of variables that exhibit similar probabilistic behaviors, and then we apply a sparse Bayesian network construction algorithm to generate a compact and interpretable Bayesian network.

Basically, the reminder of each number that is not divisible by five is either 1,2,3 or 4 when divided by 5. Subsequently, then a 4-by-4 window size has been implemented to accommodate the proposed technique. For each 4-by-4 window inside the cover image, a number from 1 to 4 could be embedded secretly from the stego image. The previous discussion must be applied separately for each of the R, G, and B arrays. Moreover, a stego-key could be combined with the proposed algorithm to make it difficult for any adversary to extract the secret image from the cover image.

In such systems ontologies capture formalized vocabularies of terms shared by its users. However in many cases users have different local views of the domain, i.e. of the context in which a given term is used. Inappropriate usage of terms together with natural complications when formulating and understanding logical descriptions may result in faulty ontologies. Recent ontology debugging approaches use diagnosis methods to identify causes of the faults. In most debugging scenarios these methods return many alternative diagnoses, thus placing the burden of fault localization on the user. This paper demonstrates how the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence of observations, that is, by querying an oracle about entailments of the target ontology. To identify the best query we propose two query selection strategies: a simple \"split-in-half\" strategy and an entropy-based strategy. The latter allows knowledge about typical user errors to be exploited to minimize the number of queries. Our evaluation showed that the entropy-based method significantly reduces the number of required queries compared to the \"split-in-half\" approach. We experimented with different probability distributions of user errors and different qualities of the a-priori probabilities. Our measurements demonstrated the superiority of entropy-based query selection even in cases where all fault probabilities are equal, i.e. where no information about typical user errors is available.", "machine_text": "We present an interactive ontology debugging framework that employs two query strategies for efficient fault localization.

We propose two query strategies: the \"Path-based\" approach, which exploits the structural relationships between concepts, and the \"Pattern-based\" approach, which targets specific patterns of errors. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, showcasing improved fault localization accuracy and reduced debugging time compared to traditional methods. Our framework provides a user-friendly interface for ontology debugging, enabling domain experts to efficiently identify and resolve errors in large-scale ontologies.

The following basic system bottlenecks detection problems are examined: (1) traditional quality management approaches (Pareto chart based method, multicriteria analysis as selection of Pareto-efficient points, and/or multicriteria ranking), (2) selection of critical system elements (critical components/modules, critical component interconnection), (3) selection of interconnected system components as composite system faults (via clique-based fusion), (4) critical elements (e.g., nodes) in networks, and (5) predictive detection of system bottlenecks (detection of system components based on forecasting of their parameters). Here, heuristic solving schemes are used. Numerical examples illustrate the approaches.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to detect bottlenecks in modular systems, addressing a long-standing problem in complex systems analysis. By leveraging a combination of graph theory and machine learning techniques, we develop a method that identifies critical components and interactions responsible for system-wide performance degradation. Our approach is based on a novel graph-based representation of the system, which captures the hierarchical structure and interdependencies between modules. We then employ a machine learning algorithm to analyze the graph and detect bottlenecks by identifying nodes and edges with the highest influence on system performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting bottlenecks in a range of modular systems, including biological networks and software systems. Our method offers a powerful tool for optimizing system design, improving system resilience, and reducing the likelihood of system failures.

We find that for this particular problem the connectionist model performs about 97% as well as the optimal Bayesian procedure. We then define a more general class of noisy single-pattern boolean (NSB) fault detection problems where each fault corresponds to a single :pattern of boolean instrument readings and instruments are independently noisy. This is equivalent to specifying that instrument readings are probabilistic but conditionally independent given any particular fault. We prove:   1. The optimal Bayesian decision rule for every NSB fault detection problem is representable by an LDN containing no intermediate nodes.

We measure galaxy position-shape correlations in the MegaZ-LRG sample for more than 800,000 luminous red galaxies, making the first such measurement with a photometric redshift sample. In combination with a re-analysis of several spectroscopic SDSS samples, we constrain an intrinsic alignment model for early-type galaxies over long baselines in redshift (z ~ 0.7) and luminosity (4mag). We develop and test the formalism to incorporate photometric redshift scatter in the modelling. For r_p > 6 Mpc/h, the fits to galaxy position-shape correlation functions are consistent with the scaling with r_p and redshift of a revised, nonlinear version of the linear alignment model for all samples. An extra redshift dependence proportional to (1+z)^n is constrained to n=-0.3+/-0.8 (1sigma). To obtain consistent amplitudes for all data, an additional dependence on galaxy luminosity proportional to L^b with b=1.1+0.3-0.2 is required. The normalisation of the intrinsic alignment power spectrum is found to be (0.077 +/- 0.008)/rho_{cr} for galaxies at redshift 0.3 and r band magnitude of -22 (k- and evolution-corrected to z=0). Assuming zero intrinsic alignments for blue galaxies, we assess the bias on cosmological parameters for a tomographic CFHTLS-like lensing survey.

Our analysis employs a novel methodology combining the CMB-LRG cross-correlation with the galaxy clustering and magnification effects. We find that the IA contamination can be significant, with an amplitude of up to 20% of the total lensing signal, depending on the assumed IA model and the survey parameters.

While it opens exciting perspectives towards rich multimedia applications, it requires the design of novel representations and coding techniques in order to solve the new challenges imposed by interactive navigation. Interactivity clearly brings new design constraints: the encoder is unaware of the exact decoding process, while the decoder has to reconstruct information from incomplete subsets of data since the server can generally not transmit images for all possible viewpoints due to resource constrains. In this paper, we propose a novel multiview data representation that permits to satisfy bandwidth and storage constraints in an interactive multiview streaming system. In particular, we partition the multiview navigation domain into segments, each of which is described by a reference image and some auxiliary information. The auxiliary information enables the client to recreate any viewpoint in the navigation segment via view synthesis. The decoder is then able to navigate freely in the segment without further data request to the server; it requests additional data only when it moves to a different segment. We discuss the benefits of this novel representation in interactive navigation systems and further propose a method to optimize the partitioning of the navigation domain into independent segments, under bandwidth and storage constraints. Experimental results confirm the potential of the proposed representation; namely, our system leads to similar compression performance as classical inter-view coding, while it provides the high level of flexibility that is required for interactive streaming. Hence, our new framework represents a promising solution for 3D data representation in novel interactive multimedia services.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel navigation domain representation for interactive multiview imaging, which enables efficient and accurate navigation in complex 3D scenes.

We shall successively consider the classical probability model, the upper and lower probabilities model, Dempster's model, the transferable belief model, the evidentiary value model, the provability or necessity model. None of these models has received the qualification of Dempster-Shafer. In fact the transferable belief model is our interpretation not of Dempster's work but of Shafer's work as presented in his book (Shafer 1976, Smets 1988). It is a ?purified' form of Dempster-Shafer's model in which any connection with probability concept has been deleted. Any model for belief has at least two components: one static that describes our state of belief, the other dynamic that explains how to update our belief given new pieces of information. We insist on the fact that both components must be considered in order to study these models. Too many authors restrict themselves to the static component and conclude that Dempster-Shafer theory is the same as some other theory. But once the dynamic component is considered, these conclusions break down. Any comparison based only on the static component is too restricted. The dynamic component must also be considered as the originality of the models based on belief functions lies in its dynamic component.", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) and other interpretations of Dempster-Shafer's model, with a focus on addressing the problem of how to reconcile the conflicting views on the underlying semantics of these models.

In large scale face recognition systems, because the probability of feature templates coming from different subjects is very high, most of the matching pairs will be rejected by the early stages of the cascade. Therefore, the cascade can improve the matching speed significantly. On the other hand, using the nested structure of the cascade, we could drop some stages at the end of feature to reduce the memory and bandwidth usage in some resources intensive system while not sacrificing the performance too much. The cascade is learned by two steps. Firstly, some kind of prepared features are grouped into several nested stages. And then, the threshold of each stage is learned to achieve user defined verification rate (VR). In the paper, we take a landmark based Gabor+LDA face recognition system as baseline to illustrate the process and advantages of the proposed method. However, the use of this method is very generic and not limited in face recognition, which can be easily generalized to other biometrics as a post-processing module.

Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.", "machine_text": "Our study investigates the relationship between gender identity and lexical variation in social media. We examine how individuals with different gender identities express themselves through language on social media platforms. Our analysis focuses on a corpus of tweets from a popular social media platform, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in linguistic features such as word choice, syntax, and tone. We find that individuals with non-binary gender identities tend to use more neutral and inclusive language, whereas those with binary gender identities tend to use more gender-specific language. Furthermore, we discover that individuals with non-binary gender identities are more likely to use language that is perceived as more creative and expressive. Our results suggest that language use is closely tied to gender identity and that social media provides a unique platform for individuals to express their gender identities through language.

However, in most instances the control law is obtained without any performance considerations and it has to be calculated by solving a complex partial differential equation (PDE). In order to address these issues we introduce a reinforcement learning approach into the energy-balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) method, which is a form of PBC in which the closed-loop energy is equal to the difference between the stored and supplied energies. We propose a technique to parameterize EB-PBC that preserves the systems's PDE matching conditions, does not require the specification of a global desired Hamiltonian, includes performance criteria, and is robust to extra non-linearities such as control input saturation. The parameters of the control law are found using actor-critic reinforcement learning, enabling learning near-optimal control policies satisfying a desired closed-loop energy landscape. The advantages are that near-optimal controllers can be generated using standard energy shaping techniques and that the solutions learned can be interpreted in terms of energy shaping and damping injection, which makes it possible to numerically assess stability using passivity theory. From the reinforcement learning perspective, our proposal allows for the class of port-Hamiltonian systems to be incorporated in the actor-critic framework, speeding up the learning thanks to the resulting parameterization of the policy.

More recently, the framework of copula modeling has gained popularity due to its modular parametrization of joint distributions. Among other properties, copulas provide a recipe for combining flexible models for univariate marginal distributions with parametric families suitable for potentially high dimensional dependence structures. More radically, the extended rank likelihood approach of Hoff (2007) bypasses learning marginal models completely when such information is ancillary to the learning task at hand as in, e.g., standard dimensionality reduction problems or copula parameter estimation. The main idea is to represent data by their observable rank statistics, ignoring any other information from the marginals. Inference is typically done in a Bayesian framework with Gaussian copulas, and it is complicated by the fact this implies sampling within a space where the number of constraints increases quadratically with the number of data points. The result is slow mixing when using off-the-shelf Gibbs sampling.

It is usual that many instances come with missing values, either because the actual value for a given attribute was not available or because it was too expensive. This is usually interpreted as a utility or cost-sensitive learning dilemma, in this case between misclassification (or regression error) costs and attribute tests costs. Both misclassification cost (MC) and test cost (TC) can be integrated into a single measure, known as joint cost (JC). We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots) that can work with any of-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles, such that we re-frame the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes (the feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for reducing the joint cost.

Our methodology, dubbed 'Parallel Belief Revision,' leverages a distributed architecture to partition the belief base into smaller, independently revisable components, and then combines the results using a novel, conflict-resolution mechanism. This approach enables efficient parallel processing of updates, leading to significant speedups in revision times. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve up to 90% reduction in revision times compared to sequential revision methods, while maintaining the consistency and coherence of the revised belief base. Our results have far-reaching implications for applications where rapid and efficient belief revision is critical, such as in artificial intelligence, expert systems, and autonomous decision-making systems.

From the viewpoint of information visualization, this paper provides a general, yet simple, solution to projection-based coloring of the SOM that reveals structures. First, the proposed color space is easy to construct and customize to the purpose of use, while aiming at being perceptually correct and informative through two separable dimensions.

The salient and interesting features that the complex network study offer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical properties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern formation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data classification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The low level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques, which realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g., geometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the high level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic meanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the extraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input data. As a result, the high level classification process measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training data. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture semantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a tourist walker in a networked environment. Specifically, a weighted combination of transient and cycle lengths generated by the tourist walk is employed for that end. Interestingly, our study shows that the proposed technique is able to further improve the already optimized performance of traditional classification techniques.", "machine_text": "We present a novel approach to high-level pattern classification in networks, leveraging the concept of tourist walks.

The signal of interest is assumed to be a superposition of $r$ multi-dimensional complex sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any \\emph{continuous} values in the normalized frequency domain. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm, called \\emph{Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)}, based on structured matrix completion that does not require prior knowledge of the model order. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form exhibiting multi-fold Hankel structure, and then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of $r\\log^{4}n$, and is stable against bounded noise. Even if a constant portion of samples are corrupted with arbitrary magnitude, EMaC still allows exact recovery, provided that the sample complexity exceeds the order of $r^{2}\\log^{3}n$.

The method uses one or more particles, which explore a mixture of nested probability distributions, each successive distribution occupying ~e^-1 times the enclosed prior mass of the previous distribution. While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration fits naturally into this technique. We illustrate the new method on a test problem and find that it can achieve four times the accuracy of classic MCMC-based Nested Sampling, for the same computational effort; equivalent to a factor of 16 speedup. An additional benefit is that more samples and a more accurate evidence value can be obtained simply by continuing the run for longer, as in standard MCMC.", "machine_text": "In our work, we address the long-standing problem of efficiently sampling complex Bayesian posteriors, which is crucial for many applications in science, engineering, and data analysis. We introduce a novel method, diffusive nested sampling, that combines the strengths of two popular approaches: nested sampling and diffusion-based methods. Our method leverages the efficiency of nested sampling for exploring the posterior distribution while harnessing the power of diffusion-based methods for efficiently traversing the complex landscape. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the sampling efficiency and accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional and multimodal posteriors. We achieve this by iteratively applying a diffusion-based algorithm to the posterior distribution, which enables the sampler to efficiently explore the entire posterior space. Our results show that diffusive nested sampling outperforms existing methods in terms of computational cost and accuracy, making it a promising tool for a wide range of applications."}

While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to push forward the interface between these two important subfields, which have been largely treated as isolated in the community.", "machine_text": "We develop a Bayesian inference framework for regularized regression models that incorporates posterior regularization, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge about the solution space. This approach is particularly relevant for infinite latent SVMs, where the number of latent variables is not fixed a priori. Our method, which we term Bayesian Posterior Regularization (BPR), leverages the flexibility of Bayesian inference to adaptively adjust the regularization strength based on the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BPR on several benchmark datasets, showcasing improved performance and interpretability compared to traditional regularization methods. Furthermore, we apply BPR to infinite latent SVMs, allowing for the estimation of a potentially infinite number of latent variables. Our results highlight the potential of BPR to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems and facilitate the discovery of novel patterns and relationships.     By integrating prior knowledge and data-driven inference, BPR offers a powerful tool for addressing challenging problems in machine learning and statistics.     We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of BPR, including a discussion of its connections to existing methods and its potential applications.     Our approach has far-reaching implications for a wide range of fields, from computer vision to natural language processing, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach complex data analysis.     We believe that our work will have a significant impact on the development of machine learning and statistical inference methods, and will provide a foundation for future research in this area.

It is widely believed that the l1- norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the success of SRC, while its use of all training samples to collaboratively represent the query sample is rather ignored. In this paper we discuss how SRC works, and show that the collaborative representation mechanism used in SRC is much more crucial to its success of face classification. The SRC is a special case of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which has various instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual and coding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels, while the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding coefficient is related to the degree of discrimination of facial features. Extensive experiments were conducted to verify the face recognition accuracy and efficiency of CRC with different instantiations.", "machine_text": "We address the problem of face recognition by proposing a novel Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) approach. Our method leverages the strengths of both collaborative representation and deep neural networks to improve face recognition performance. In CRC, we represent each face as a combination of multiple collaboratively learned features from different face regions. These features are then used to train a classification model that can effectively distinguish between different individuals. Our experimental results demonstrate that CRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 97.5% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and 98.1% on the Extended Yale B dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CRC in handling occlusions and variations in lighting conditions. Our approach is robust and efficient, making it a promising solution for real-world face recognition applications.   (Note: This is the abstract generated by the AI model.
