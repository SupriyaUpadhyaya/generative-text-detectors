{"id": "Tsui Po-ko", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsui%20Po-ko", "title": "Tsui Po-ko", "text": "Tsui Po-ko () (17 May 1970 \u2013 17 March 2006) was a Police Constable of the Hong Kong Police Force, murderer and bank robber.\n\nHe was killed during an ambush on two Police Constables in a Jordan subway which led to a shootout. The inquest into the events leading up to his death aroused great interest in Hong Kong, as it unravelled a string of intriguing events, and revealed the secret life of a policeman with a delusional state of mind.\nOn 25 April 2007, the five-person jury in the coroner's court unanimously decided that Tsui was responsible for injuring one and killing two fellow police officers and a bank security guard, on three separate occasions.  The jury returned a verdict that he had been \"lawfully killed\" by fellow officer Tsang Kwok-hang in a shootout. The inquest lasted 36 days, one of the longest ever inquests in Hong Kong.\n\nAssistant Police Commissioner John Lee said that this was \"an exceptional case\", while Coroner Michael Chan Pik-kiu called it \"the most difficult\" inquest for a jury he had ever encountered.\n\nBiography\nTsui was the elder of two children born in Shaowu, Fujian, and arrived in Hong Kong in 1978 with his mother. His father and brother arrived a year later. He attended the Kwun Tong Government Secondary Technical School (now Kwun Tong Kung Lok Government Secondary School). After graduation, he had several jobs, including a stint with the Royal Hong Kong Regiment.\n\nTsui joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1993; he regarded it as a well paid job with good benefits, and was a police constable for 13 years until his death in 2006. He was an outstanding cadet at the Hong Kong Police College, having won the \"silver whistle\".\n\nTsui was an excellent marksman, scoring full marks in target shooting and simulated bank robbery shooting in 1993. From 2001 to 2005, in the tests held three times a year, he scored a perfect 48 points.  According to shooting range records, Tsui was a left-handed shooter but had also claimed that he was ambidextrous to a superior.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Tsui made four attempts at the 'Police Constable/Senior Police Constable to Sergeant Promotion Qualifying Examination', He scored 68 marks in his 2000 attempt which earned him an interview, but his stubbornness and difficulty in communication meant that he was never promoted,  and had given up applying for promotion by 1999. From then on until 2003, Tsui applied three times to join the Airport Security Unit, but failed in every attempt.  He failed a personality assessment during the first attempt, and subsequently failed because of insufficient fitness.  Between 2002 and 2005, he was attached to the Tsing Yi district.\n\nTsui's wife, Lee Po-ling, worked at the Social Welfare Department as a social security assistant.  The couple met when she worked as a sales assistant at the airport, and Tsui was also stationed there. They married in 1997 and had a daughter in 2000.\n\nIn October 2001, Tsui and his wife appeared together in a couples version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on ATV and won HK$60,000 and stated that they would donate some of the money to charity.\n\nTsui was an avid sportsman and Oxfam Trailwalker, and was known to participate in marathons and paragliding.  Unbeknownst to his wife, he would also frequent massage parlours, karaoke bars, and prostitutes in Mong Kok and Shenzhen. Tsui was a habitual heavy gambler and was known to have made a HK$75,000 wager on Japan to win the 2004 Asian Cup final at odds of 2.8:1 on 7 August 2004.\n\nMurder of Police Constable Leung Shing-yan\nTsui was found responsible for murdering constable Leung Shing-yan () and stealing his revolver in March 2001. The 24-year-old Leung, who was engaged, had been on the force for five years.\n\nAt 12:05 on 14 March 2001, the Lei Muk Shue Police Station received a regarding a noise complaint from a flat at Shek Wai Kok Estate. Leung responded to the call alone as his partner was still having lunch. His final radio call was received at 12:25 when he reported that he had arrived at the flat and nobody was responding to his knocks. He was subsequently attacked, struggling with his assailant to prevent his revolver being snatched, but was shot five times at close range. Leung took three bullets in the head and two in the back at Flat 552, Shek To House Block B. Under police guard, paramedics wearing bulletproof vests rushed Leung to Yan Chai Hospital where he was declared diseased upon arrival. His revolver, a fully loaded Smith & Wesson Model 10 4 Inch heavy barrel type revolver, a speedloader, loaded with six \"Calber 38Spl\" bullets were missing.\n\nThe noise complaint was likely bogus and was made from an burner phone. The police suspected that the officer was lured to the scene for his firearm. Heavily armed police locked down the building and mounted a search. Some 3,000 people, of which 2,000 were police officers, were interviewed by the police but the perpetrator escaped detection. Later, forensic tests found that the DNA on a mask left at the crime scene matched Tsui's.\n\nLeung is survived by his parents and a younger brother and sister. His wedding was scheduled to have been held in May.  His funeral in Hung Hom was attended by top officials including Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Police Commissioner Tsang Yam-pui.  Leung was buried at Gallant Garden. In 2002, he was posthumously awarded the Medal for Bravery (Silver) in recognition of his courage and \"gallantry of an extremely high order\".\n\nBank robbery\nOn 5 December 2001, Tsui carried out an armed bank robbery of the Hang Seng Bank branch at Belvedere Garden in Tsuen Wan.\n\nAt 12:10, masked and alone, he burst into the bank. Security Guard Zafar Iqbal Khan, aged 31, struggled with the man. Khan was shot three times in the head, body and wrist. Khan cocked his Remington shotgun during the robbery after being shot twice, but did not manage to fire before his death. Tsui fled the bank with HK$490,000 and US$1,000,  entering Castle Peak Road and then into the Belvedere Garden shopping arcade before escaping through another exit.  Police entered the shopping arcade and launched a manhunt but failed to catch the suspect.\n\nThe police located several domestic helpers who witnessed the robber removing his balaclava following the robbery and produced a facial composite image of the suspect.\n\nThe perpetrator was described as a man with short hair and about 1.8 m tall, whom Assistant Police Commissioner Yam described as a \"calm, cold-blooded and brutal robber\".  A HK$2\u00a0million reward was issued. Immediately following the robbery the police noted that the murder weapon appeared to be a police service revolver.\nIt was later discovered that Tsui matched the description of the perpetrator as captured on closed circuit television; key pieces of evidence were a red T-shirt, Mizuno brand shoes and the fact that footage showed the killer to be a left-handed gunman.  He was placed near the scene by the police; Tsui boarded a bus from Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung at 11:11 using a Octopus card issued to his wife; and boarded a minibus bound for Tsuen Wan at 11:53.\nA red T-shirt carrying a similar distinctive logo as captured on CCTV was found at Tsui's home after his death.  The T-shirt, bearing the logo of the Yinchuan International Motor-cycle Travel Festival was a gift to Tsui by the club secretary during his visit to the show in 2000.  An expert witness identified the T-shirt as having been worn inside-out during the robbery. Forensic ballistics later identified the gun used in the robbery as the police service revolver taken from police officer Leung Shing-yan in 2001.\n\nZafar Iqbal Khan is survived by four children and wife, who lived in Pakistan at the time of his death. A ceremony attended by his relatives, friends and bank chairman Vincent Cheng was held at the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre on 7 December before his body was returned to Pakistan later in the day. Khan was posthumously awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for \"selfless bravery of the highest order\", which was accepted on his behalf by his wife.\n\nFinancial irregularities\nAn investigation by the Criminal Intelligence Bureau into Tsui's financial status from January 2000 to March 2006 revealed he had a total of 19 personal banking and investment accounts hidden from his wife, the total assets of which amounted to a total of HK$2,977,513. Seven personal and 12 investment accounts were opened under his name around mid-February in 2002 using a friend's address.  Between February 2002 and October 2004, Tsui deposited HK$557,718 into the 19 accounts.  All transactions were in cash. It was reported that Tsui was active in foreign exchange market, commodities, securities, funds, and margin trading, and had lost a total of HK$371,982 in those investments.\n\nTsui and his wife bought one flat in August 1997 and paid HK$574,800 in cash. Two years later, he bought a flat at Tung Chung Crescent with a HK$396,173 down payment, paying monthly installments of HK$17,778 for a first and a second mortgage.  The mortgages were paid off in just five years, with HK$388,151 in 2001 and HK$500,000 in 2004.\n\nThe police alleged that the transactions were inconsistent with a constable's salary and that the HK$500,000 in unexplained cash would be consistent with the amount stolen during the heist in 2001.\n\nAmbush of Constable Sin Ka-keung and Constable Tsang Kwok-hang\n\nOn 17 March 2006, 28-year-old Constable Sin Ka-keung () and 33-year-old Constable Tsang Kwok-hang () were ambushed by Tsui while on patrol in the pedestrian subway connecting Austin Road and Canton Road. Constable Sin reported seeing Tsui lurking on the northern stairs of the subway and attempted to approach him. When the officers approached, Tsui fired upon both officers, striking Sin in the head and left leg and mortally wounding Tsang in the head. Sin and Tsang returned fire, with Sin missing 2 shots while Tsang hit Tsui with 5 shots to the torso and head, killing him. Tsang would re-holster his revolver and radio for help before succumbing to his wounds, while Sin would survive the incident. The revolver used by Tsui in the shootout was confirmed to be the service revolver taken from Constable Leung and used in the heist in 2001.\n\nConstable Sin was awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for his actions and wrote a book about his experience.\n\nMental state\nAs the inquiry continued, Tsui was found to be an ambitious officer who often topped his class and did well in assessments. However, he was often denied promotions or opportunities to join elite units such as the Airport Security Unit.\n\nHe was not media shy, as shown demonstrated by his appearance on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  and was happily photographed when he won the chance to buy his flat in a draw and during the 1 July March in 2004 where he was dressed in traditional Chinese funeral style clothing (\"\u62ab\u9ebb\u6234\u5b5d\").\n\nAn associate professor of social science at the City University of Hong Kong suggested that Tsui, like many criminals, did not know how to face frustration, and chose instead to take an illegal path in obtaining socially approved goals, such as money, prestige or recognition.  It was suggested that the police force should pay more attention to talented officers who fail to gain promotion, and recommended that there should be independent and confidential psychological counselling services for such troubled or frustrated officers.\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal profiler believed that Tsui's behaviour fit into most of the definitions of schizotypal personality disorder, while an expert from the Queensland University of Technology said Tsui's personality profile matched that of a serial killer who believed he was destined to change the world, attempting to rise above his self-perceived unremarkable life and playing God by taking lives.\n\nLegacy\nThe Tsui Po-ko case has inspired some film and television productions, including:\n\nDocumentaries\nAnatomy of a Crime: \"HK's Rogue Cop\"\n\nFiction\n Mad Detective, a 2007 film\n A Great Way to Care \u300a\u4ec1\u5fc3\u89e3\u78bc\u300b, a 2009 TVB series\n The Men of Justice, a 2010 ATV series\n Shades of Rogue, a 2014 short film\n\nReferences\n\n1970 births\n2006 deaths\n2006 crimes in Hong Kong\n2006 in Hong Kong\n21st-century criminals\nHong Kong murderers\nHong Kong police officers\nHong Kong serial killers\n2006 murders in Asia\nMale serial killers\nMurder in Hong Kong\nPeople from Nanping\nPeople shot dead by law enforcement officers in China\nPeople with schizotypal personality disorder\nPolice misconduct\nChinese bank robbers\n2000s murders in Hong Kong", "machine_abstract": "Tsui Po-Ko (born September 16, 1974) is the current Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company's Greater China Region and President of Shanghai Disneyland Resort in Pudong New Area, Shanghai.\nShe was appointed to her position on January 1, 2009 after serving as Vice Chairman at Hong Kong International Airport Limited since 2006.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Tsui Po-ko\".

{"id": "Death Magnetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%20Magnetic", "title": "Death Magnetic", "text": "Death Magnetic is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on September 12, 2008, through Warner Bros. Records. The album was produced by Rick Rubin, marking the band's first album since ...And Justice for All (1988) not to be produced by longtime collaborator Bob Rock. It is also the first Metallica album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo, and the second to share writing credit to all of the band's members.\n\nMetallica began writing music for a new album in 2006, later recording the album at different studios across Los Angeles County, California, from March 2007 to May 2008. Musically, Death Magnetic is a radical departure from Metallica's previous album, St. Anger (2003), and is considered a return to the band's thrash metal roots, with more complex compositions, standard guitar tuning on most songs and long guitar solos from Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. It also includes the band's first instrumental piece, \"Suicide & Redemption\", since \"To Live Is to Die\" from ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic made Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive number-one studio albums on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album received positive reviews, but its production was criticized as overcompressed and cited as a product of the loudness war. The album and its songs were nominated for six Grammy Awards (five in 2009 and one in 2010) and won three, including Best Metal Performance for \"My Apocalypse\". In support of the album, Metallica embarked on the World Magnetic Tour from October 2008 to November 2010. Four unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions were later released as the Beyond Magnetic EP in December 2011.\n\nProduction\n\nWriting\n\nEarly in 2004, lead singer James Hetfield revealed that Metallica had been playing new material during studio sessions, but that there was no mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, \"I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff when we get back to the studio in January.\" On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, it was reported that Metallica was planning to use the following six months to write material for the album, in addition to the previous two months they had already been spending writing music. Ulrich also stated that the band was getting along much better in the studio than they did during the recording of St. Anger. On April 6, he revealed that the band had composed \"six to seven\" songs (except for vocals) from their findings off the riff tapes recording during pre-sets of the Madly in Anger with the World Tour. He also said that by this point, the band's new material was reminiscent of \"old school\" Metallica works, and that it certainly did not feel like a St. Anger \"part two\".\n\nOn May 20, 2006, Kirk Hammett revealed that the band had fifteen songs written and were writing on average two to three songs per week. Hetfield also praised producer Rick Rubin for his production style in giving the band their own freedom and keeping the pressure at a minimum, despite the sessions becoming sometimes briefly unfocused. On May 27, Metallica updated their website with a video featuring information regarding the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThree studios were used to produce the album, those being Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California, and HQ in San Rafael, California. On January 1, 2007, Ulrich stated in an interview with Revolver that the band would be conceiving the album much like they did their albums prior to working with ex-producer Bob Rock; they would sit down, write a select number of songs, then enter the studio to record them. He also quoted Rubin by saying \"Rubin didn't want them to start the recording process until every song that they were going to record was as close to 100 percent as possible.\"\n\nOn March 5, Ulrich revealed that the band had narrowed a potential 25 songs down to 14, and that they would begin recording those fourteen on the following week. He also expanded on Rubin's style of production, saying,\n\nOn March 14, the band's official website issued a statement: \"Metallica left the comfort of HQ this week to descend upon the greater Los Angeles area to begin recording their ninth original album. This is the first time they've recorded outside of the Bay Area since they spent time at One-on-One Studios recording their self-titled album in 1990 and '91.\" This was confirmed on July 24, 2008, on Mission: Metallica, as a video surfaced showing the crew moving into Sound City Studios of Nirvana fame.\n\nOn June 4, Robert Trujillo revealed that only select portions of the two new songs debuted in Berlin and Tokyo respectively would be featured on the album. The band hoped to have the album finished by October or November, when the album would be mixed. He predicted the album would be out in February 2008, and revealed that the songs they were working with were quite long.\n\nOn February 2, 2008, Sterlingsound.com revealed that Ted Jensen from Sterling Sound Studios would be mastering the new record. According to Blabbermouth.net and other sources, Greg Fidelman, who had served as a sound engineer, had also been tapped to mix the album.\n\nUlrich confirmed on May 15, 2008, that Metallica recorded eleven songs for Death Magnetic, although only ten would appear on the album due to the constraints of the physical medium. The eleventh song, titled \"Shine\" (which was later retitled \"Just a Bullet Away\"), was a song Hetfield \"based around a Layne Staley type, a rock & roll martyr magnetized by death.\"\n\nUnreleased tracks\n\nA number of unreleased songs from Death Magnetic, including the above-mentioned \"Just a Bullet Away\", but also \"Hell and Back\", \"Hate Train\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\" were left off the album, but were rumored to be released as B-sides or on the next album. The titles were confirmed by Hammett and Ulrich on the MetOnTour video from December 20, 2008. On December 5, 7, 9 and 10, 2011, the band played four new songs, \"Hate Train\", \"Just a Bullet Away\", \"Hell and Back\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\", at the band's 30th Anniversary concerts. The day after each concert, MetClub members were sent an e-mail with a code for a free download of a rough mix of the song played at the show. The songs were released officially on the Beyond Magnetic EP, released on December 13, 2011. Two other songs recorded during Death Magnetic, based on \"The New Song\" (performed in 2006) and \"The Other New Song\" (performed in 2006 and 2007), have not been released, though parts of \"The New Song\" can be found in the recorded songs \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\".\n\nTitle\nKirk Hammett played a role in inspiring the album title by bringing a photograph of deceased Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley to the studio where Metallica was recording. \"That picture was there for a long time\", said Hammett, \"I think it pervaded James' psyche.\" Wondering why someone with Staley's talent would choose to use drugs so heavily and die so young, Hetfield started writing a song based on his questions (the song \"Rebel of Babylon\").\n\nOn July 16, 2008, Hetfield commented on the album's title:\n\nThe title is referenced in the track \"My Apocalypse\". According to Hammett, another title considered for the album was Songs of Suicide and Forgiveness. Death Magnetic was eventually picked out of four working titles when Hetfield met with creative agency Turner Duckworth, who were brought to deal with the album's visual identity, and as he discussed the songs \"it was clear that they were all linked to death, facing up to the nature of death, and the fear and attraction that surrounds death.\"\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nIn January 2008, a statement was made by Stereo Warning that the album would be delayed until September 2008, The album, which was completed on August 10, 2008, was released on September 12 in the United States and issued in a variety of different packages.\n\nOn September 2, a French record store began selling copies of Death Magnetic, nearly two weeks ahead of its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made prematurely available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor, Vertigo Records, to officially release the album two days ahead of schedule, on September 12. Ulrich, who was questioned about the leak on a San Francisco radio station, responded,\n\nHe later told USA Today,\n\nDuring their Escape from the Studio '06 tour, Metallica debuted two songs. \"The New Song\" debuted on the European leg in Berlin, Germany on June 6, 2006. The song, as performed, is approximately eight minutes long. The title was rumored to be \"Death Is Not the End\" as Hetfield repeatedly sings the line throughout the song. This song would appear again in multiple Fly on the Wall videos on the Mission: Metallica website, showing the band partway through the song's recording, as noted by the slower tempo and lack of lyrics. \"The Other New Song\", (which was later named \"Vulturous\") debuted on August 12, 2006, in Tokyo, and is much shorter, taking just below four minutes to perform. To the surprise of fans, Metallica played \"The Other New Song\" once again on June 29, 2007, in Bilbao, Spain. Although neither of the \"New Songs\" appear on the album themselves, \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" both contain elements of \"The New Song\".\n\nOn August 9, 2008, Metallica debuted the first album track, \"Cyanide\", at Ozzfest, in Dallas, Texas and was performed again on August 20, 2008, in Dublin, Ireland. On August 22, at the Leeds Festival, they debuted the first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\".\n\nOn July 31, 2009, it was announced on Metallica.com that the band felt that the song \"My Apocalypse\" was in need of an introduction when played live to \"set the mood\". The statement on Metallica.com reads, \"We've been enjoying playing 'My Apocalypse' out here on the road but felt like it could use something extra. We decided that it needed a cool intro to set the mood so James wrote one. Check out and enjoy this free download\u00a0... and make sure you learn it for singing along at a future show!\" The approximately minute-long introduction is available as a free MP3 download. The song had originally been debuted live on March 25, 2009, at the LG Arena in Birmingham, UK.\n\nOn the day of the release FMQB radio broadcast The World Premiere of Death Magnetic, which was heard on more than 175 stations across the US and Canada. The live program from Metallica HQ featured all four members of Metallica talking with Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins. Originally scheduled for a 90-minute broadcast, the show ended after two hours.\n\nPackaging and versions\nUlrich brought the agency Turner Duckworth, co-owned by his personal friend David Turner, as he wanted someone that \"would bring fresh ideas\", and commanded respect in branding but were not jaded by the music business\". While Turner and his partner Bruce Duckworth played with the two elements from the title, they emerged with the cover that combined a white coffin, a grave, and a magnetic field, depicted by a model made and photographed by Andy Grimshaw. Turner added the image was \"simple and literal but at the same time open to all sorts of interpretations\", saying that Hetfield considered the coffin shaped as \"a door, to another experience, or consciousness\". Duckworth stated that the cover fit their intention of something that would also be recognizable in a digital format, \"small icons that go on your phone or iPod\".\n\nTurner compared the Metallica project with a campaign they did for Coca-Cola, as both approaches went down to \"stripping things back down to what the brand was originally and the other part was adding a fresh new approach.\" The original Metallica logo was brought back to demonstrate how the band was trying to restore their old identity, while the cover was primarily white to contrast how the color is hardly used in the metal genre. Given the band wanted the physical release to be memorable to ensure it still had value in an age where audiences were purchasing more digital music, the original digipak featuring a layered die cut, where each page of the booklet resembled a layer of dirt being thrown on the coffin. Death Magnetic was issued on vinyl in a special box set, and also had a deluxe edition shaped like a coffin, bundled along with an additional disc full of demos, a making-of DVD, an exclusive T-shirt, guitar picks, a flag and a fold-out poster.\n\nGuitar Hero\nAlongside the release of the album, it was released as downloadable content (DLC) for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. This content would later be optimized for external use in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica (although \"All Nightmare Long\" was included on the in-game setlist), Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.\n\nThe Guitar Hero DLC had two versions of the instrumental track \"Suicide & Redemption\". The versions differed by the guitar solo performed on the song: one version had a solo performed by Hetfield, the other a solo by Hammett. The tracks were titled according to the solo they contained, with the Hetfield version named \"Suicide & Redemption J.H.\" and the Hammett version named \"Suicide & Redemption K.H.\"\n\nDue to technical restrictions, the Wii version of Guitar Hero: World Tour only could hold the three shortest songs of the eleven: \"Broken, Beat & Scarred\", \"Cyanide\" and \"My Apocalypse\". These songs also appear on the Wii and PS2 versions of Guitar Hero: Metallica as bonus songs instead of DLC. The eight remaining tracks (including both versions of \"Suicide & Redemption\") were released on November 24, 2009, as DLC for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero for Wii.\n\nTour\n\nMetallica promoted Death Magnetic with the World Magnetic Tour, which started on October 21, 2008, in Phoenix, Arizona. The North American leg finished in February 2009 and was followed by European concerts, interrupted only by a surprise gig at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas to promote the video game Guitar Hero: Metallica. A second North American leg, prioritizing markets missed by the original concerts, began in September. The tour returned to both continents while also extending to Latin America, Israel, Japan and Oceania in 2010, ending on November 21 in Melbourne, Australia. The 2010 Sonisphere Festival headlined by Metallica had them for the first time accompanied by the rest of the \"Big Four of thrash metal\", Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, and the concert where all bands played together for one song was released theatrically and on home video as The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria. Metallica also released in November 2009 two video albums out of World Magnetic Tour performances that year, Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n, y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico featuring three Mexico City concerts in June, and Fran\u00e7ais Pour une Nuit with a concert in the French town of N\u00eemes in July.\n\nReception\n\nIn a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, ex-Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum described his impressions of the unfinished songs:\n\nThe album's first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\", was described by BBC Music as the closest thing to a ballad on the album. Rock Sound has also compared it to the likes of Thin Lizzy. The band has abandoned the solo-free approach that they followed on St. Anger, returning to complex, multi-layered arrangements such as those typically found on the band's fourth album ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic has been praised by fans as well as critics as a comeback for Metallica after the widely panned St. Anger. Thrash Hits was one of the first websites, along with The Quietus, to comment on Death Magnetic, claiming \"it is a vast improvement on 2003 album St Anger\". Metal Hammer noted Death Magnetics \"sharp riffs\" and \"uncharacteristic bouncing grooves\", and favorably compares the band's sound on the album to bands like Slayer, Led Zeppelin and Rage Against the Machine. Former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy has praised the album, saying \"Death Magnetic is hands down the best Metallica album in 20 years. This is the CD I've been waiting for them to make since ...And Justice for All. And thumbs up to them for doing the first real Metallica instrumental in 20 years since 'To Live Is to Die'. Welcome back, boys.\"\n\nWhile Metallica was on the first leg of their 2008 tour in Europe, a third party at their management Q Prime demanded that media impressions and blogs commenting on the album be taken down from their website for reasons that were not explained to the band. However, when the band learned of this, they were upset and Ulrich re-posted many of the links along with other reactions to the new album, along with an apology to those whose links had been removed from Metallica's website.\n\nReviews for the album have been mostly positive. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated the album was like \"hearing Metallica sound like Metallica again\". Other positive reviews come from publications like The Guardian, who say that the album is \"the strongest material the band have written in 20 years\", and Uncut, declaring that \"like all the best heavy rock albums, it suspends your disbelief, demands your attention and connects directly with your inner adolescent.\" BBC Music's Chris Jones felt that Hetfield's lyrics had become \"the channel of his post-therapy angst\". The Observer stated \"it's a joy to have these gnarled veterans back to reinforce the sheer visceral thrill of timeless heavy metal\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, after a reviewer for Swedish daily Sydsvenskan admitted that he preferred a shortened mix of Death Magnetic to the official release, a scheduled interview was duly cancelled by Universal Music Sweden. Its president, Per Sundin said:\n\nCompression\n\nThe album has been criticized for having compromised sound quality, due to an excessively compressed dynamic range, leading to audible distortion. Sean Michaels of The Guardian explains that this is \"a result of the 'loudness war' \u2013 an ongoing industry effort to make recordings as loud as possible\". A Rolling Stone article states that Rubin was \"overseeing mixes in Los Angeles while the band is in Europe, headlining shows\" and only communicated with him by conference calls.\n\nFans have noted that these sonic problems are not present in the Guitar Hero version of the album, where the guitars, bass, drums, and vocals are presented separately due to the mechanics of the game. The tracks were sent to the game publishers prior to being compressed. As a result, fans have shared \"Guitar Hero\" versions of the album. MusicRadar and Rolling Stone attribute a quote to the album's mastering engineer Ted Jensen in which he claims that \"mixes were already brick-walled before they arrived\" for mastering and cite a petition from fans to remix or remaster the album.\n\nMetallica and Rubin initially declined to comment, while the band's co-manager Cliff Burnstein stated that complainers were in a minority and that response to the album had otherwise been \"overwhelmingly positive\". Ulrich later confirmed in an interview with Blender, that some creative control regarding the album's production had been transferred to Rubin but also stressed his satisfaction with the final product.\n\nIn 2015, the album was re-released on iTunes with a new \"Mastered for iTunes\" mastering which features an improved dynamic range and lack of distortion. Digital downloads from Metallica's official website all use the \"Mastered for iTunes\" version.\n\nAccolades\nDeath Magnetic and its songs were nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009, including Best Rock Album and Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \"Suicide & Redemption\", winning Best Metal Performance for \"My Apocalypse\". Rick Rubin also received the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and art directors Bruce Duckworth, David Turner & Sarah Moffat were awarded Best Recording Package. \"The Unforgiven III\" was also nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Death Magnetic was awarded Best Album in the 2009 Kerrang! Awards.\n\nAt the 2008 Metal Storm Awards, the album won Best Heavy Metal Album and Biggest Surprise.\n\nCommercial performance\nDeath Magnetic debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, selling 490,000 copies in just three days of availability. It is the band's fifth consecutive studio album to debut at #1, making Metallica the first band to have five consecutive studio album releases to do so. The album marked the highest first week sales for the group since 1996's Load.\n\nAccording to the September 27, 2008 issue of Billboard, Death Magnetic landed at #1 on the following ten charts: Billboard 200, Billboard Comprehensive Albums, Top Rock Albums, Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums, Top Digital Albums, Top Internet Albums, Top European Albums, Tastemakers. \"The Day That Never Comes\" topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album stayed at #1 for three consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200, and spent 50 consecutive weeks on said chart. Internationally, it peaked at #1 in 34 countries, including Ireland, the UK, Canada and Australia.\n\nIn addition, nearly 60,000 copies were sold digitally, making it debut at #1 on the Digital Album chart. The album debuted at #1 on the UK albums chart after three days of availability, selling 75,164 copies. It remained at #1 for two weeks and has sold over 150,000 copies to date.

It seeks to understand how drugs affect the human body as a single complex biological system. \nInstead of considering the effect of a drug to be the result of one specific drug-protein interaction, systems pharmacology considers the effect of a drug to be the outcome of the network of interactions a drug may have. In 1992, an article on systems medicine and pharmacology was published in China. Networks of interaction may include chemical-protein, protein\u2013protein, genetic, signalling and physiological (at cellular, tissue, organ and whole body levels).  Systems pharmacology uses bioinformatics and statistics techniques to integrate and interpret these networks.\n\nSystems pharmacology can be applied to drug safety studies as a complement to pharmacoepidemiology.\n\nSee also\n\n Quantitative Systems Pharmacology\n Drug interaction\n\nPhD programs\nPharMetrX: Pharmacometrics & Computational Disease Modelling (annual call for applications, July - Sept 15th)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Quantitative Systems Pharmacology white paper\n Systems Pharmacology at Harvard\n What is (Quantitative) Systems Pharmacology? by John Russell\n\nPharmacology", "machine_abstract": "The systems biology approach to drug discovery is called \"systems pharmacology,\" which integrates the study of drugs and their effects on biological networks into one field.\nSystems Pharmacology - The Systems Biology Approach To Drug Discovery", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Systems pharmacology\".

It was discovered on 18 December 1992, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at CERGA in Caussols (), southeastern France. The asteroid was named after the Swedish city of Gothenburg (G\u00f6teborg).\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nG\u00f6teborg is a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8\u20133.2\u00a0AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,892 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 11\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins 61 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken the night before its first identification as  at Lowell Observatory in January 1931.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nSlow rotator \n\nIn September 2012, photometric observations of G\u00f6teborg at the Palomar Transient Factory, California, rendered a rotational lightcurve with a period of  hours, or 14 days, and a brightness variation of 0.70 magnitude (). This makes a slow rotator, as most asteroids of this size typically have much shorter rotation periods.\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, G\u00f6teborg measures 15.491 and 15.689 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.084 and 0.1169, respectively The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.14, taken from 221\u00a0Eos, the family's largest member and namesake \u2013 and calculates a diameter of 11.53 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.44.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after Gothenburg (G\u00f6teborg), Sweden's second-largest city and the largest port in the Nordic countries, located on the country's southwest coast. Founded in the early 17th century and heavily influenced by the Dutch, the city still has its typical canal system. Later, the Swedes acquired political power over Gothenburg and the city flourished with the development of the Swedish East India Company in the early 18th century. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 March 2000 ().\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (10001)-(15000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\n010551\nDiscoveries by Eric Walter Elst\nMinor planets named for places\nNamed minor planets\n010551\n19921218", "machine_abstract": "The Swedish Air Force's Saab 340B fleet is named after the ten largest cities in Sweden, and was originally designated as Sveriges Flygflottilj (Swedish Flying Fleet).

{"id": "Ballet Shoes (novel)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet%20Shoes%20%28novel%29", "title": "Ballet Shoes (novel)", "text": "Ballet Shoes: A Story of Three Children on the Stage is a children's novel by Noel Streatfeild, published by Dent in 1936. It was her first book for children, and was illustrated by the author's sister, Ruth Gervis. Diane Goode illustrated a 1991 edition published by Random House.\n\nBallet Shoes was a commended runner up for the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best British children's book by a British subject. (The author would win the award later for another book.)\n\nPlot summary\nThe book concerns three adopted sisters, Pauline, Petrova and Posy Fossil.  Each of the girls is discovered as a baby by Matthew Brown (Great-Uncle-Matthew, known as \"Gum\"), an elderly, absentminded palaeontologist and professor, during his world travels, and sent home to his great-niece, Sylvia and her childhood nanny, Nana.\n\nGum embarks upon an expedition of many years and arranges for money to support the family while he is gone. Gum does not return in the promised five years and the money is almost gone. As they have no way to contact or track him down, Sylvia and Nana take in boarders to make ends meet, including Mr. Simpson and his wife, Dr. Jakes and Dr. Smith, a pair of tutors who take over the children's schooling after Sylvia can no longer afford their school fees, and Miss Theo Dane, a dance teacher who arranges for the children to begin classes at the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training.\n\nPauline finds she has a talent and passion for acting while Petrova hates acting and dancing. Posy has a real talent for dancing. When she is about six, Madame Fidolia, a famous and retired Russian dancer, gives Posy private lessons, something she has never done before. As the children mature, they take on some of the responsibility of supporting the household. Much of the drama comes from the friction between the sisters and from balancing their desire to help support the family financially against the laws limiting the amount of time they may spend on stage. When Pauline is picked for a lead part, the early success goes to her head, because of which the producer replaces her with her understudy (although only for a single performance, not permanently as portrayed in the 2007 film). Through this, Pauline learns enough humility to balance her talent, and goes on to play many successful lead parts.\n\nPosy is developing into a brilliant ballet dancer. She also clashes with her sisters, as she is so focused on dancing that she is insensitive about anything that gets in her way. Petrova is not interested in the performing arts and has little talent for it but must keep attending classes and performing to help support the family. However, she holds onto her own dream of flying aircraft.\n\nThe book ends with Pauline going off to Hollywood to make a film, accompanied by Sylvia. Posy is going to a ballet school in Prague, accompanied by Nana. Petrova wonders what will become of her, as she is still too young to live on her own and doesn't want to dance or act. At this moment, Gum arrives. He has been away so long that he doesn't realise who the three girls are at first, but after recognising that they are the three babies he left all those years ago, he decides he will take Petrova under his wing and help her achieve her dream.\n\nCharacters\n\nGum  Great-Uncle Matthew Brown, an elderly geologist and professor, who finds the three sisters during his travels. Gum is Sylvia's great uncle and later guardian after her parents die.\nSylvia Brown  Gum's great-niece, known to the girls as \"Garnie\", short for Guardian. Sylvia is a practical and caring woman. Sylvia's father died at the beginning of the book and she and her mother moved in with Gum. When Sylvia was 16 her mother died.\nNana  Alice Gutheridge, Sylvia's stern nurse. Called \"Nana\" by family and friends alike.\nPauline Fossil  The eldest sister by two years, rescued from a shipwreck.  A talented actress and a great beauty, with an independent, bumptious streak.\nPetrova Fossil  The middle sister, adopted from a young couple who died in Russia.  Petrova is a tomboy, hardworking and diligent, but interested only in engines and aeroplanes and cars.\nPosy Fossil  The youngest sister by two years, whom Gum sends to the house by district messenger in a basket with a pair of ballet shoes.  Her mother, a dancer, may well be alive, as it is said she 'has no time for babies' at the time of Posy's adoption.  Posy is considered a child dance prodigy, though she was still too young to perform on stage at the book's conclusion.\nDr. Jakes and Dr. Smith  Boarders.  A pair of retired professors of literature and maths, respectively, who offer to teach the girls.  Dr. Jakes first inspires the girls to think of their adoptive state as being full of potential and individuality, without any chance of their achievements being attributed to family connections.\nMr. and Mrs. Simpson  Boarders.  Mr. Simpson is particularly friendly with Petrova, on account of his Citro\u00ebn car and auto-repair garage. In the 2007 film adaptation Mrs. Simpson's character was abandoned so that Mr. Simpson could serve as a love interest for Sylvia.\nMiss Theodora \"Theo\" Dane  The last boarder.  An impractical dance teacher at the Children's Academy of Classical Ballet.\nMadame Fidolia  A retired Russian prima ballerina of the old Russian empire.  Now head of the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training.  Posy's teacher and mentor.\nWinifred  A fellow student at the Children's Academy.  Though considered the best all-round pupil at the Academy, she often loses major roles on account of her plain looks and inadequate clothing, the latter a result of her large family's poverty.  Winifred is both a particular friend and rival of Pauline.\n\nTelevision adaptations\n\nBallet Shoes has twice been adapted for the screen, both by the BBC:\nBallet Shoes in 1975, starring Elizabeth Morgan, Sarah Prince, and Jane Slaughter as the sisters.\nBallet Shoes in 2007, starring Emma Watson, Yasmin Paige, and Lucy Boynton as the sisters.\n\nIn popular culture\n The Shoes books are mentioned in the film You've Got Mail by Meg Ryan's character, a bookstore owner.\n\nCritical reception\n\nOn 5 November 2019 BBC News included Ballet Shoes on its list of the 100 most influential novels.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Ballet Shoes at Noel Streatfeild \u2013 fansite\n The Fossil Cupboard \u2013 Noel Streatfeild discussion board [inactive]\n\n1936 British novels\nBritish children's novels\nNovels about orphans\nBritish novels adapted into films\nJ.

{"id": "Calcium channel blocker toxicity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium%20channel%20blocker%20toxicity", "title": "Calcium channel blocker toxicity", "text": "Calcium channel blocker toxicity is the taking of too much of the medications known as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), either by accident or on purpose. This often causes a slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. Some CCBs can also cause a fast heart rate as a result of the low blood pressure. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually occur in the first six hours but with some forms of the medication may not start until 24 after hours.\n\nThere are a number of treatments that may be useful. These include efforts to reduce absorption of the drug including: activated charcoal taken by mouth if given shortly after the ingestion or whole bowel irrigation if an extended release formula was taken. Efforts to bring about vomiting are not recommended. Medications to treat the toxic effects include: intravenous fluids, calcium gluconate, glucagon, high dose insulin, vasopressors and lipid emulsion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be an option.\n\nMore than ten thousand cases of calcium channel blocker toxicity were reported in the United States in 2010. Along with beta blockers and digoxin calcium channel blockers have one of the highest rates of death in overdose. These medications first became available in the 1970s and 1980s. They are one of the few types of medication in which one pill can result in the death of a child.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nMost people who have taken too much of a calcium channel blocker, especially diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure (vasodilatory shock). This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure.\n\nOther potential symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, a decreased level of consciousness, and breathing difficulties. Symptoms usually begin within 6 hours of taking the medication by mouth. With extended release formulations symptoms may not occur for up to a day. Seizures are rare in adults but in children occur more often. Hypocalcaemia may also occur.\n\nCause\nCalcium channel blockers, also known as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used for a number of health conditions. Thus they are commonly present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused the greatest number of deaths in 2010 in the United States was verapamil. This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than many of the others.\n\nDiagnosis\nA blood or urine test to diagnose overdose is not generally available. CCB overdose may cause high blood sugar levels, and this is often a sign of how severe the problem will become.\n\nElectrocardiogram\nCCB toxicity can cause a number of electrocardiogram abnormalities with a low sinus rhythm being the most common. Others include: QT prolongation, bundle branch block, first-degree atrioventricular block, and even sinus tachycardia.\n\nDifferential\nIt may not be possible to tell the difference between beta blocker toxicity and calcium channel blocker overdose based on signs and symptoms.\n\nManagement\nThe medical management of CCB toxicity may be difficult. It may not improve with the usual treatments used for a low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. In those who have no symptoms or signs six hours following taking an immediate release formulation and 24 hours after taking an extended release formulation need no further medical treatment.\n\nDetoxification\nActivated charcoal is recommended if it can be given within an hour or two of taking the calcium channel blockers. In those who have taken an extended release formulation of a CCB but are otherwise doing fine, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol may be useful. Causing vomiting by the use of medications such as ipecac is not recommended.\n\nInsulin\nHigh doses of intravenous insulin with glucose may be useful and are a first line treatment in overdoses. As this treatment may cause a drop in blood sugar and blood potassium levels, these should be monitored closely.\n\nOther\n\nIntravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is considered a specific antidotes. Slow heart rate can be treated with atropine and sympathomimetics. Low blood pressure is treated with vasopressors such as adrenaline.\n\nThere is tentative clinical evidence and good theoretical evidence of the benefit of lipid emulsion in severe overdoses of CCBs. Methylene blue may also be used for those with low blood pressure that does not respond to other treatments.\n\nEpidemiology\nMore than 10,000 cases of potential calcium channel blocker toxicity occurred in the United States in 2010. When death occurs in medicine overdose, heart medications are the cause more than 10% of time. The three most common types of heart medications that result in this outcome are calcium channel blockers along with beta blockers and digoxin.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nPoisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances\nCalcium channel blockers\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\nWikipedia emergency medicine articles ready to translate", "machine_abstract": "Calcium channels are transmembrane proteins that allow the passage of calcium ions into cells in response to chemical signals from outside or inside the cell.\nThe term \"calcium channel\" is used by pharmacologists and clinicians as shorthand for all types of ion channels which transport Ca2+, including voltage-gated (VGCC), receptor-operated (ROCC) and store operated (SOCC).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Calcium channel blocker toxicity\".

She married attorney Francis Percival McIntire; the couple moved to Francis' hometown of Savannah and had six children. The oldest, James William, was born in 1910; Francis Jr. on July 19, 1921; and the youngest, Pope, was born in 1924.\n\nSocial and volunteer work\nWhile living in Savannah, McIntire co-founded local chapters of the Junior League of Savannah and the League of Women Voters; she was the first president of the Junior League of Savannah, and also served as president of both the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs and the Savannah Suffrage Association.\n\nMcIntire helped to establish a free lunch program within the Chatham County School District, and she was the first woman to serve on Savannah's Metropolitan Planning Commission.\n\nFollowing her work supporting presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson, McIntire was appointed the first Georgia Committeewoman on the Democratic National Committee. During the 1930s, she served as a field supervisor for the Works Progress Administration, and after the outbreak of World War II she worked as a service director for the American Red Cross and founded the U.S.O.\u2013Soldiers Social Service of Savannah.\n\nMcIntire was involved with the conversion of the Isaiah Davenport House into a museum; she is Isiah Davenport's great-great-great-granddaughter.

Her son was played by Johnny Mercer, whom she \"advised... to give songwriting and acting a try\". The production traveled to New York City to compete in the Belasco Theatre's sixth annual tournament, performing in both the Frolic Theatre (May 11, 1928) and the old New Amsterdam Theatre before placing second.\n\nMcIntire also helped found the Georgia Poetry Society and won prizes for her own work.\n\nRegarding her work with Historic Savannah Association, McIntire wrote that Savannah was \"one of the most beautiful cities and unique in the United States\", lamenting that \"[y]ear after year architecturally beautiful homes and historic structures were going down\".\n\nDeath and legacy\nThe city of Savannah named McIntire Woman of the Year in 1955. In 1958, she received the Groves Award and the Oglethorpe Trophy for her preservation work.\n\nMcIntire died on November 4, 1967 in Savannah, Georgia. She is buried at Laurel Grove Cemetery.\n\nShe was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nMcIntire is a character in Michael Ching's 2017 opera Anna Hunter, the Spirit of Savannah, which premiered in Savannah; the role was originated by Legera Danielides.\n\nPoetry\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1886 births\n1967 deaths\nPeople from Georgia (U.S. state)", "machine_abstract": "Lucy Barrow McIntires (born September 16, 1943) is the wife of former U.S. Senator George McGovern and mother to his two children from his first marriage.

{"id": "Battle of Smolensk (1812)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Smolensk%20%281812%29", "title": "Battle of Smolensk (1812)", "text": "The Battle of Smolensk was the first major battle of the French invasion of Russia. It took place on 16\u201318 August 1812 and involved about 45,000 men of the Grande Arm\u00e9e under Emperor Napoleon I against about 30,000 Russian troops under General Barclay de Tolly. Napoleon occupied Smolensk by driving out Prince Pyotr Bagration's Second Army. The French artillery bombardment burned the city to the ground. Of 2,250 buildings, 84% were destroyed with only 350 surviving intact. Of the city's 15,000 inhabitants, about 1,000 were left at the end of the battle inside the smoking ruins. With over 15,000 casualties, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the invasion.\n\nPrelude\n\nVitebsk operation\nThe Russian First Western Army under General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly slipped away from Vitebsk on 27 July after an inconclusive fight against Emperor Napoleon, avoiding a general engagement. Napoleon was frustrated by his inability to bring the Russian army to battle and lingered at Vitebsk until 12 August to reform his Grande Arm\u00e9e and wait for stragglers to catch up. General Jean-Andoche Junot replaced King J\u00e9r\u00f4me as commander of the Westphalian VIII Corps and the Corps joined Napoleon's main army on 4 August near Orsha.\n\nFrench situation\nAfter five weeks of non-stop operations, the main 375,000-man strike force available to Napoleon had been reduced to 185,000 men by a host of factors. 90,000 troops under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot and Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, Jean Reynier and Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg had been detached for various missions. Russian forces had inflicted thousands of combat losses on Napoleon's main army, but the primary cause in the reduction of his force was strategic consumption\u2014the need to garrison cities, towns, fortresses and forward supply depots.\n\nRapid forced marches and the inability of supply wagon trains led to high incidences of desertion and tens of thousands of losses to hunger and disease, most notably dysentery. The scorching July heat reduced the availability of water supplies. Huge numbers of cavalry horses and transportation horses and oxen had died due to a lack of grazing areas and the inability of the wagons to carry enough fodder.\n\nRussian plan\n\nThe loss of vast stretches of Russian territory to the advancing French led to a crisis and shift in power in the Russian high command. An aggressive \"Russian\" faction around Prince Pyotr Bagration called for an immediate, all-out attack against Napoleon. They were supported by Czar Alexander I and the bulk of the officer corps. The \"foreign\" faction around Barclay de Tolly, composed mostly of officers of German extraction, advocated the continuation of the present policy of delay and withdrawal to dilute Napoleon's striking power. Under strong pressure from above and below, including threats of force, Barclay agreed to an offensive on 6 August. Ignorant as to French dispositions, Barclay intended to outflank what he presumed to be the isolated corps of Viceroy Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais near Rudnia, destroy it, and inflict further losses on the French as they came to Eug\u00e9ne's aid.\n\nBarclay advanced on Rudnia and Poryeche on 7 August.Count Matvei Platov's Cossacks imposed a sharp defeat on General Horace S\u00e9bastiani's cavalry near Inkovo the same day, inflicting 600 French casualties. On 8 August, Barclay received false intelligence that Eug\u00e8ne's corps was at Poryeche and reoriented half of his army to face north. Platov was directed to rejoin Barclay's army and Bagration was to move to Vidra. Bagration disobeyed his orders, fearing French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's threat to his left flank. He declared his army was hungry and sick and moved to Smolensk. Barclay failed to stop him, merely adjusting his own forces to compensate. On 11 August, Barclay stayed put and engaged only in outpost fighting with French cavalry under Neapolitan King Joachim. On 12 August, Barclay's scouts found Poryeche empty and he directed Platov to reconnoiter the French movements. The Russian offensive had failed due to disagreements among the generals, Barclay's inactivity and pointless marches that lost the Russians time they could not recover.\n\nFrench plan\n\nNapoleon had expected a Russian offensive and saw in it a great opportunity to envelop and annihilate the Russian army. He directed Marshal Jacques MacDonald to cross the Daugava to help out Oudinot's force and ordered Oudinot and Saint-Cyr to attack Prince Peter Wittgenstein's 20,000-strong corps to prevent it from assisting Barclay. Napoleon came up with what became known as the Smolensk maneuver, a masterful operation designed to outflank Barclay from the south, cut off the Russians from Moscow and destroy the isolated Russian army, thus bringing the war to an end.\n\nThe action at Inkovo on 7 August was seen by Napoleon as heralding an immediate Russian attack. Worried, he deployed his army in a defensive posture around III Corps. By 10 August, Barclay's glacial slowness of operations had convinced Napoleon that the threat had passed. He proceeded with his maneuver. Vitebsk was garrisoned with a force of 3,800 men, which later grew to 7,000, to protect the French lines of communications. Napoleon did not know Barclay's exact location and was acting on instinct. The Grande Arm\u00e9e would advance in two huge columns commanded by Napoleon and Davout. Napoleon's column consisted of Joachim Murat's cavalry, the Imperial Guard, III Corps and IV Corps. It would cross the Dnieper at Rosasna. Davout's column would cross at Orsha, composed of I Corps, V Corps and VIII Corps. This giant force would advance east along the left bank of the Dnieper, swing north to cut the Smolensk-Moscow road and annihilate the isolated Russians. Latour-Maubourg's cavalry would attack down the Dnieper as a diversion. Napoleon's deployment remained hidden from the Russians due to a thick cavalry screen under Generals Emmanuel de Grouchy, \u00c9tienne de Nansouty and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. French engineers under General Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9 erected four pontoon bridges across the Dnieper near Rosasna on the night of 13\u201314 August and by daybreak the 175,000-strong Grande Arm\u00e9e was advancing rapidly toward Smolensk.\n\nBattle of Krasnoy\nBarclay had left Generalmajor Neverovski's 27th Division to guard Krasnoy, along with some cavalry and artillery. This force of 5,500\u20137,200 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 10\u201314 guns was attacked by 20,000 Frenchmen under Murat and Marshal Michel Ney beginning around 2:30 PM on 14 August. Murat's and Ney's inability to coordinate their infantry-cavalry operations allowed the Russians to get away, at the cost of 1,500\u20132,300 Russian men and seven guns as well as 500 French casualties. The French had multiple excellent chances to annihilate the Russians but failed to so.\nNeverovski retreated into Smolensk, shutting the gates behind him. The French inability to capture to the city on the fly imposed a disastrous delay on their operations. Neverovski requested reinforcements from Bagration and received Nikolai Raevsky's VII Corps, which arrived on the morning of 15 August to defend the southern bank of the Dnieper near Smolensk.\n\nBarclay learned of the French attack from Neverovski. He interpreted Napoleon's offensive as a retreat and prepared to capture Vitebsk. He ordered Bagration to move south along the Dnieper. Bagration refused, pointing out that Smolensk, Neverovski and Raevsky were in grave danger. He then received permission from Barclay to deploy to the Dnieper's southern bank at Katan. Barclay ordered General Dmitry Dokhturov's corps to join Bagration and directed the Smolensk governor to evacuate the city archives. No decisive action was undertaken by Barclay due to uncertainty about Napoleon's locations. Czar Alexander left the army and turned over command of the armies to Barclay, ordering him to defend Smolensk. Barclay decided to rush his and Bagration's men down the road from Vitebsk to Smolensk. With his entire plan of operations hanging in the balance, Napoleon failed to act with sufficient vigor and ordered a 24-hour halt to the advance instead.\n\nBattle\n\nSmolensk, a historic fortress city of 12,600 inhabitants on the main Western invasion route to Moscow, was defended by bastion towers and a thick stone wall. The River Dnieper ran through the middle. The Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk housed one of the most venerated icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Our Lady of Smolensk attributed to St Luke, and Napoleon assumed that the Russians would fight outside the city to avoid its destruction. By 16 August, French forces found the city heavily garrisoned by Bagration's troops, further reinforced with the subsequent arrival of Barclay and the main Russian army.\n\nThe main battle was fought on 16 August. An initial probing force captured two suburbs but failed to bring the Russians out to battle. Napoleon ordered a general assault with three corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, supported by two hundred artillery pieces. This was initially successful, the intense artillery bombardment setting the city on fire. French forces lacked ladders or climbing apparatus to scale the city walls and were under counter fire from Russian artillery. By nightfall, most of the city was burning.\n\nTo save the army, Barclay de Tolly abandoned the city destroying all ammunition stores and bridges leaving a small force to hold out for two days to cover his retreat. Around dawn on 17 August, Grande Arm\u00e9e Polish forces successfully breached the walls, and in a few hours the main French forces entered the city. Barclay retained forces on the other side of the river preventing a crossing until the night of August the 18th. The city was almost completely destroyed.\n\nCasualties\nBarclay de Tolly claimed 4,000 Russian casualties, while Bogdanovich spoke of 6,000 . Docturov's VI Corps had 16,800 men available prior to the battle but only 6,000 capable of combat at its end, which would mean 10,800 casualties for one Russian corps alone. Prince Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg's division lost 1,300 men alone. Gaston Bodart gave 6,000. whilst David Chandler estimates them as 12,000\u201314,000. Alexander Mikaberidze suggests 10,000 Russian casualties at Smolensk.\n\nNapoleon claimed 700 French killed and 3,100\u20133,200 wounded. His estimate is disputed, as I Corps alone under Lobau lost 6,000. Chandler puts French losses at 10,000, while Mikaberidze also suggested 10,000. Bodart listed 10,000. Russian authors claimed the French losses were as high as 20,000.\n\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription \"SMOLENSK 17 VIII 1812\".\n\nSee also\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia\nBattle of Smolensk (1941)\nJean-Victor Poncelet\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConflicts in 1812\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles involving Russia\n1812 in the Russian Empire\nSmolensk\nAugust 1812 events\nBattles of the French invasion of Russia\nSmolensk Governorate\nBattles inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe", "machine_abstract": "The Battle of Smolensk was fought between the Russian Empire and Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1812, during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\nSmolensk had been captured by French forces under Marshal Ney on August 16\u201317 after fierce fighting against Russians defending it from within its walls as well as those attacking outside them.

{"id": "No Money (song)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%20Money%20%28song%29", "title": "No Money (song)", "text": "\"No Money\" is a song by Swedish electronic music duo Galantis. It was released on 31 March 2016 as the lead single from their second studio album, The Aviary (2017). The song features uncredited vocals from Reece Bullimore, son of Beatbullyz's Andrew Bullimore and is written by Digital Farm Animals and Andrew Bullimore. It samples the amen break, most prominently at 1:44. It was commercially successful, peaking at number one in Norway and reaching the top ten in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark. Additionally, it became their first single to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at number 88.\n\nMusic video \nThe video starts with a young girl sewing a picture of the Galantis' Seafox in a jacket while humming the song. She paints her nose and wears the jacket and leaves the house through the window with her face painted like an animal. Other children walk with their face painted to an abandoned building. The girl then slowly makes her way to the building, while  more children with their face painted join her. The girl then enters the building and confronts another girl with her face painted. The two then have a dance-off, with the first girl winning while the other falls and disappears. The video has over 603 million views on YouTube. The video features product placement by Converse All-Star shoes.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences \n\n2016 singles\n2016 songs\nWarner Music Group singles\nNumber-one singles in Norway\nGalantis songs\nSongs written by Digital Farm Animals\nSongs written by Christian Karlsson (DJ)\nSongs written by Henrik Jonback\nSongs written by Style of Eye\nSongs written by Svidden\nSong recordings produced by Digital Farm Animals\nSongs written by Andrew Bullimore", "machine_abstract": "No money, no money No money in my pocket I don't have any cash But I'm still happy to be alive Yes!

{"id": "Acer Aspire One", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer%20Aspire%20One", "title": "Acer Aspire One", "text": "Acer Aspire One is a line of netbooks first released in July 2008 by Acer Inc.\n\nMany characteristics of a particular model of Acer Aspire One are dictated by the CPU platform chosen.  Initial models were based on the Intel Atoms.  Later, models with various AMD chips were introduced.  Newer versions of the Atom were adopted as well.\n\nEarly versions were based on the Intel Atom platform, which consists of the Intel Atom processor, Intel 945GSE Express chipset and Intel 82801GBM (ICH7M) I/O controller, and is available in several shell colors: seashell white, sapphire blue, golden brown, onyx black, and coral pink.\n\nHigher end models were released in June 2010 consisting of the AMD Athlon II Neo processor and ATI Radeon HD 4225 graphics controller. These are available in onyx black, antique brass, or mesh black shells depending on model.  Also released was a version of the Aspire One 521 with an AMD-V105 processor running at 1.2\u00a0GHz, an ATI Radeon 4225 graphics controller, and equipped with a HDMI port.\n\nA range of later models were powered by AMD Brazos APUs (combined CPU/GPU chips).  The AMD chips had much more powerful video capabilities but consumed more power.\n\nIts main competitor in the low-cost netbook market was the Asus Eee PC line.\n\nIn January 2013, Acer officially ended production of their Aspire One series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks.\n\nHistory\n\nThe line was originally manufactured for Acer Inc. by Quanta Computer.; Quanta was phased out as a supplier to Acer, and production of the Acer Aspire One line shifted to other manufacturers in 2009. Also starting in 2009, eSobi Inc. partnered with Acer to preload the eSobi News Center on Acer Aspire One netbooks beginning in the first quarter of 2009.\n\nOperating systems\n\nWindows\n\nWindows XP Home Edition SP3 is installed on the models with a name ending in X, or ending in B followed by another letter denoting color.\n\nIt is also possible to install and run Windows Vista or Windows 7 on the earlier model laptop. In high-end versions appearing during 2009, Windows Vista is pre-installed. The lack of a DVD-ROM drive requires creating a bootable USB flash drive (the on-board card reader slots are not bootable) using a USB external DVD drive or PXE boot network install.\n\nWindows 7 Starter is installed by default on models with a name starting in D such as D255E and D257 as well as other later Aspire models.\n\nLinux\n\nModels with names starting in L, or ending in A followed by a letter for color, are shipped with Linpus Linux Lite, which is based on Fedora 8.  This offers a simplified user interface, with default applications like the Firefox 2 browser, OpenOffice.org 2.3, Acer One Mail and Acer One Messenger available directly on the main screen. The default desktop environment has been designed to hide advanced features from the user and to prevent modification. It is possible to modify the system to present a more traditional Xfce 4 desktop, enable more advanced features such as context menus, or install additional software.\n\nIt is possible to install and run other Linux distributions on the Acer Aspire One, and some specially customised Linux distributions have been designed to offer out-of-the-box functionality. These include:\nJoli OS\nUbuntu Netbook Edition (UNE)\nLinux4One\nKuki Linux\nArchOne\nMoblin\nSlitaz\nOther distributions of the Linux operating system will also run, such as :\nArch Linux\nFedora\nCentOS\nDebian\nCrunchBang\nBunsenLab\nantiX\nMandriva Linux\nUbuntu, Ubuntu Studio\nEeebuntu\nopenSUSE\nSlackware\nLinux Mint\nPCLinuxOS\n MeeGo\n Puppy Linux\n Peppermint Linux\n Lubuntu - which also features a netbook specific desktop environment.\n Xubuntu\n Parrot Security OS\n MX Linux\n\nMac OS X\n\nThrough the OSx86 project, an Aspire One can boot and run a modified version of Mac OS X, including iAtkos, iDeneb, \"XxX\" and Kalyway distributions. This procedure is not supported by Apple or Acer.\n\nFreeBSD\n\nFreeBSD v. 8.2 is known to run on the Acer Aspire One, although some limitations apply: lid close not starting a hibernate, and power management which works to a very limited degree.\n\nOpenBSD\n\nOpenBSD releases ranging from 4.4 to 6.4 are known to run on some of the many models of Aspire One, with some limitations based on BIOS and other variations.\n\nAndroid\n\nSome models are dual boot (e.g. D250, D260), with Android 1.6 and Windows 7 Starter.  The computer boots up into Android first, with a tab to select Windows.  The Android-x86 OS has limited apps available to it.\n\nFreeDOS\n\nIt is possible to install FreeDOS on even the earliest models. Some peripherals, like a USB mouse or Ethernet port, will not be detected by the standard setup and may require manual tweaking.\n\nStorage\n\nSolid state drives\n\nThe A110 model ships with an 8\u00a0GB or 16\u00a0GB solid-state drive (SSD), although some models do not come with one. Early 8 GB models come with the Intel Z-P230, model SSDPAMM0008G1. This SSD has been criticized for its slow read and write speed. Intel lists the drive's maximum speeds as 38\u00a0MB/s read and 10\u00a0MB/s write. Later models come with the slightly faster Samsung P-SSD 1800.\n\nHard disks\n\nThe hard disk is a regular 2.5-in 5400 rpm SATA drive with 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, 500 or 750\u00a0GB. A number of different drives from different manufacturers have been reported to be included. Newer-model Aspire Ones take a 7\u00a0mm thick drive, as opposed to the usual 9.5\u00a0mm thickness that makes up most 2.5-inch form factor hard drives and SSDs.\n\nExpansion slot\n\nThere is also an SD/SDHC storage expansion slot on all models for additional storage (the 533 model does not support SDHC as verified by Acer support UK).  On Linux versions this automatically expands the space of the SSD or HDD using aufs.  Windows XP models treat it as a normal removable drive.\n\nSome models have a second slot that functions as a standard multi-in-1 flash memory card reader.  The 110 BIOS does not allow one to boot an operating system from this slot, but the 150 BIOS is capable of booting from an SDHC card in the slot.  (Note: with Linux, it is possible essentially to boot from HD or USB by using a /boot partition on the regular boot device and an initrd that loads the real OS from the slot).\n\nPower management\n\nThe Intel Atom platform has a specified maximum TDP of 11.8\u00a0W. Individual figures are 2.5\u00a0W for the N270 processor, 6\u00a0W for the 945GSE chipset and 3.3\u00a0W for the 82801GBM I/O controller.  The AUO B089AW01 LCD panel is rated at a maximum power consumption of 3\u00a0W.  Typical read\u2013write power consumption for the SSD is around 0.3\u00a0W, and 0.01\u00a0W when idle. The different HDDs are rated at about 1.5\u20132.5\u00a0W for read\u2013write operations and around 0.7\u00a0W when idle.\n\nThe official ratings for the battery are up to 3 hours for the three cell, and up to 8 hours for the six cell.  Linpus Linux Lite has been optimized by Acer for lower power consumption. Battery life is shorter on HDD configurations with Windows XP, at approximately 2.5 hours for the three cell.  Although the standard three cell battery is 2.2\u00a0Ah, some users have reported 2.4\u00a0Ah and 2.9\u00a0Ah batteries from the factory.  Various suppliers online now carry aftermarket batteries, including the six cell. Aftermarket nine cell batteries are available though they are quite heavy, and also protrude out of the back, reducing the aesthetics but improving airflow.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAn Acer AOD model (10.1\" screen) product comparison guide, in the form of a spreadsheet file download, is available from increa.com.\n\nAdditional hardware\n\nSince November 2008 the 3G-enabled model Aspire One A150X-3G is available in Europe, while models with 3G modems began shipping in the United Kingdom in December of the same year and were denoted by the letter G in their model number. The first generation Aspire One webcam is an Acer Labs International M5608 camera controller with attached 0.3\u00a0MP SuYin or 1.3\u00a0MP LiteOn CMOS sensor.\n\nSome models of the Aspire One use an Intel 945GSE chipset which only supports 2\u00a0GB of RAM. Installing memory modules larger than 2\u00a0GB has caused the Aspire to fail the power-on self-test.  Model 522, featuring the AMD Fusion C-50 chip, has been reported to work with 4\u00a0GB installed (although the included Windows 7 Starter edition has an artificially imposed 2 GB limit).\n\nAO751h (751h)\n\nThe AO751h has the larger 11.6\" screen with an LED backlit display and a 1366x768 native resolution. It includes a 1\u00a0GB/667\u00a0MHz DDR2 533\u00a0MHz SDRAM memory option (2 GB being the maximum), a 160 GB HDD option, Bluetooth option, Intel northbridge US15W, and an OS option for Windows Vista Home Basic edition or Windows XP Media Center Edition. All AO751h units are powered by an Intel Atom Z520 processor running at 1330\u00a0MHz (or 1240\u00a0MHz in first version). The US15W system controller incorporates a GMA500 video core. The AO751h has a dual power (AC/DC) option. The six cell battery provides the working time of about 8 hours. Besides the mentioned specifications of the AO751h it supports 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interface, 802.11g Wi-Fi card Atheros, Bluetooth 2.1, standard VGA-out jack, 3 USB 2.0 ports, a Memory Card reader 5:1 (xD-Picture Card, SD card), as well as Microphone In jack 3.5\u00a0mm (1/8\" Mini), Headphone Out jack 3.5\u00a0mm (1/8\" Mini). One of the cons is the relatively small TouchPad and mouse buttons. Large and comfortable keyboard is one of the distinguishing features of the device.\n\nThere have been reports of some AO751h units randomly freezing, which has led to recalls in Denmark.  Some users have reported that having their motherboards replaced by Acer solved the problem and Acer officially reporting that the fix is to install an updated BIOS.\n\nAOA150 speaker vibration and other issues\nThe 8.9\" models have an improperly designed speaker location that causes vibration to the internal hard drive, causing it to be problematic. The right speaker is especially prone to this. Audio frequencies around 1 kHz cause the hard drive to almost stop responding. Full volume MP3/audio playback easily causes these models to run extremely slowly, or crash because of unresponsive disk I/O. This problem also causes bad sectors, crashed hard drives and corrupt Windows partitions in the long term. Even sound from an external speaker with 1\u00a0kHz tone test causes this hard drive behaviour. SSD drives do not suffer from this problem. Workarounds identified are: listening to music at a lower volume, using only the left speaker, using a software equalizer to tone down the 1\u00a0kHz frequency, replacing the hard drive with an SSD, and trying to install soft sound dampening material around the speakers and the hard drive.\n\nAspire One Happy\n\nThe Acer Aspire One Happy is a 10.1\u00a0inch netbook with different operating systems: (Android 2.1 and Windows 7). It was launched by Acer Inc. in November 2010. The computer is nearly identical to the Acer Aspire One D255. The main difference is that the Happy case comes in several different color options (comes in Candy pink, Lavender purple, Lime green and Hawaii blue). It is powered by Intel Atom N450 or dual-core Intel Atom N550, with up to 2\u00a0GB RAM and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3150. There is also a 3G version for proper portability, with each model measuring 24\u00a0mm thick and weighing 1.25\u00a0kg with a six-cell battery pack.\n\nIn mid\u20132011, the \"Acer Aspire One Happy 2\" line was released. This model may have bluetooth on board.  It seems that some countries ship this newer model with bluetooth while others do not.\nThis seems to depend which wireless card they shipped with, some can in fact be replaced as the BIOS should not be card specific.\nThe functionality uses an internal USB bus on miniPCIe slot specification but not all have these pins connected.\nA good way to check is find a miniPCIe to USB3 card and see if the device is recognized or not.\n\nAcer Aspire One D270\n\nThe Acer Aspire One D270 netbook is the first 10-inch Acer netbook to feature a 1.6\u00a0GHz Intel Atom N2600 dual core processor and running Windows 7 Starter 32-bit. The AOD270-1186, the white models, feature an Intel Atom N2600 dual core processor with 1\u00a0MB L2 cache, 1.6\u00a0GHz processor and Hyper Threading technology. The AOD270-1410, the black model, features a 10.1 inch WSVGA LED-backlit display with CrystalBrite technology with a 17:10 aspect ratio and 1024 x 600 resolution display, 1\u00a0GB DDR3 SDRAM memory, a 320\u00a0GB 5400\u00a0rpm hard drive and integrated Intel GMA 3600 graphics with 64\u00a0MB dedicated memory.\n\nIn Europe, the Acer Aspire One D270-26Ckk NU.SGAED.011 is running Linpus Linux and comes in an \"espresso black\" color. It also includes 2 GB of RAM, and a 320 GB hard drive. With Linux, this netbook becomes a bit faster than its Windows 7 counterpart.\n\nAlthough Intel specifies the maximum RAM capability of the N2600 as 2 GB, numerous users have reported a 4 GB SODIMM works well in the D270, with 2.99 GB reported usable by Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit (after upgrading from Starter).\n\nSome models of the Acer Aspire One D270 have Windows 7 Home Basic pre-installed and have an Intel Atom N2800 1.86\u00a0GHz processor.\n\nSome more recent AOA's can be upgraded to 4GB 1.5V RAM if they use DDR3 and the 64 bit CPU; though this is not a recommended upgrade path it  works on the D270 -26Dbb and the modification was medium term stable on the test machine running x64 Windows 7 Home using SDR#. It is believed that many other inexpensive VT64x equipped DDR3 netbooks have the same capability but disabled for licensing reasons or due to the clock circuitry being unable to handle certain modules correctly resulting in system instability, that can be overcome using spdtool and slightly altering timing parameters.\n\nThere are known issues with the WiFi in the D270 over time, which sometimes occur after the card is changed. Putting the OEM one back in does not resolve this problem and symptoms include the Fn + F3 not working. Further investigation suggests that the issue may be BIOS corruption and replacing or reflashing the chip may well resolve it but as of yet this is untested. The D270 is known to have SPECTRE/Meltdown vulnerabilities but this may be patched at a later date with a third party BIOS.\n\nReception\n\nCNET editors' review has been positive, although held reservations as the Aspire One is early to market and many netbooks are planned for the near future.\n\nA The Tech Report (Techreport.com) review of the 751h, and the similar Gateway LT3103U, was generally positive, praising the notebooks' battery life but criticizing the large number of third party software products preinstalled and running by default on the computers.\n\nSee also\n Gateway netbooks\n Comparison of netbooks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nComputer-related introductions in 2008\nLinux-based devices\nNetbooks\nAndroid (operating system) devices\nAcer Inc. laptops", "machine_abstract": "Acer Aspire One (also known as Acer AO1) is the first netbook computer from Taiwanese company Acer Inc..

{"id": "Brentford Library", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford%20Library", "title": "Brentford Library", "text": "Brentford Library is a Grade II listed building at Boston Manor Road, Brentford, London.\n\nIt was built in 1903 by Joseph Dorey and Co; for the then Brentford District Council. The benefactor was Andrew Carnegie and the architect was Nowell Parr. The foundation stone was laid by the Countess of Jersey, who lived not far away at Osterley Park.\n\nThe building is constructed from yellow stock brick laid in English bond and dressed with terracotta. The roof uses Welsh slate. It was designated a listed building on 2 October 1990.\n\nOn the floor of the entrance hall is a mosaic displaying the coat of arms of Middlesex (in the original form, identical to that of Essex, without the Saxon crown). Also in the entrance hall, on the staircase leading up, is a marble memorial by Nowell Parr dedicated to the local men who died in the Second Boer War.\n\nIt closed in November 2016 due to plaster falling from the roof in the children's area. Structural engineering surveys show that all three ceilings need repair, and as of end December 2016, Hounslow Council hope to re-open it \"very early in the New Year\". It partially reopened in January 2017, and in full in April.\n\nBrentford war memorials \n\nJust outside the library are situated several memorials dedicated to the men of Brentford who lost their lives in the First World War and the Second World War. The main memorial, unveiled in 1923, is in the form of a stone pillar. On one side is an inscription which reads:\n\nOn the other sides are the names of Brentford's First World War dead. Next to the main memorial are three smaller memorials. The middle one originally stood outside the now largely neglected St Lawrence's Church in Brentford High Street near the bridge over the Grand Union Canal. Repaired and restored, it has stood outside the Library since 19 September 2009. The other two are dedicated to the employees of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and they were moved to Brentford after the Company's works in Fulham closed in 1949. The names are on metal plaques and there are separate ones for each of the World Wars.

The ZNDH was founded under German authority in April 1941, following the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nAlthough it could not be considered a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe ZNDH maintained a flying training school equipped with gliders and trainers, originally at Rajlovac airfield near Sarajevo and then at Velika Gorica and Pleso airfields in Zagreb. Its parachute and paratroop school was located in Koprivnica.\n\nHistory\n\nEstablishment\nThe ZNDH came into being as early as 19 April 1941, just nine days after the proclamation of the NDH. Its commander was Colonel Vladimir Kren, a former captain of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (; VVKJ), who had defected to the Germans in Graz in his Potez 25 on 4 April 1941 and declared himself an Usta\u0161e supporter.\n \nThe first task of the new air force, the backbone of which was provided by 500 former VVKJ officers and 1,600 NCOs, was the acquisition or salvage of aircraft, weapons, machinery, equipment and fuel that had survived the fighting and had not been confiscated by the German or Italian forces.\n\nFollowing the brief April War, the Germans had captured over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered them to be of little use for the Luftwaffe, so it was decided to equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.\n\nKren also initiated the formation of an early warning system, anti-aircraft batteries (armed with German and Czech weapons) and various training and servicing departments, ammunition stores and workshop facilities. The fuel necessary for the operations of the ZNDH was supplied by the Germans from former Yugoslav stocks in Kraljevo, Serbia.\n\nAs early as May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they got some of the remaining largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, as well as a huge variety of spare parts.\n\nDuring the middle part of 1941, some of the ZNDH's man-power capacity (one fighter squadron and one medium bomber squadron) was sent to the Eastern Front as part of the Luftwaffe, the Croatian Air Force Legion (; HZL; ). Most of the Croatian Air Force Legion's personnel were back on NDH territory by late 1942 (bomber squadron)/early 1944 (fighter squadron) to help counter the growing Allied air threat.\n\nThe personnel of the ZNDH took over and re-activated the airfields at Zagreb, Sarajevo, Mostar, Banja Luka and Zemun, where the Ikarus and Zmaj aircraft plants were located. By June 1941, the Germans had begun to pass on to the ZNDH various captured VVKJ aircraft, including eight Bristol Blenheim I and five Potez 25 bombers. These and most of the 211 ex-VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and/or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun.\n\nThe first missions: 1941\n\nIn late 1941 the ZNDH had 95 aircraft distributed in four groups and eight squadrons. Fighting the Yugoslav Partisans from the air had begun already in late June 1941, when Breguet 19 and Potez 25  bombers had proved most suitable. The Breguets could carry a bomb load of up to  using 24  bombs, whilst the Potez 25s could carry about half that amount. Both types were also armed with three  machine guns. Altogether the ZNDH eventually came to possess 50 Breguet 19s and 45 Potez 25s. The operational use of these light bombers was not limited to fighting the Partisans; the aircraft were also used to supply isolated or surrounded army strong points.\n\nThe emblem of the ZNDH was to be the red and white chequerboard insignia, (), derived from the Croat coat of arms, dating back to the 10th century, carried on the fin. In January 1945 this was replaced by the black and white trefoil cross of King Zvonimir.\n\nAs well as the Breguet and Potez aircraft, which were the most numerous types in the ZNDH inventory, Zmaj Fizir FP-2 light biplane trainers were also converted to carry six  bombs. These aircraft were used to bomb and strafe Partisan troops and positions in northern Bosnia but they also faced anti-aircraft fire. The first missions cost the ZNDH a Breguet and a Potez aircraft, both of which crash landed after being hit by Partisan ground fire. The ZNDH crews had little chance of survival after being hit, as flying suits, helmets and parachutes were not available at the time - hence their desperate crash-landings.\n\nSimilar actions continued throughout 1941. The ZNDH flew many missions in support of Army troops in limited scale operations against the Partisans mostly over eastern and western Bosnia, as well as over other parts of the NDH. By September, the ZNDH introduced larger aircraft for bombing Partisan forces and territory. Two bombers, an Avia Fokker F.IX derived F.39 and a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 were available for operations and had the added advantage of being able to carry  bombs. They were extensively used for bombing villages and road communications. However it was soon established that the vintage biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft were ideally suited for missions against Partisan troop concentrations. Although they were outdated and certainly their use would be out of the question on any other front, their performance and armament made them very dangerous for an ill-armed enemy. The Partisans were scattered in villages, forests and mountains and their positions could only be detected by a slow moving aircraft. Visual reconnaissance missions using hand-held cameras were also flown. Aerial reconnaissance supplied the army with vital data about Partisan movements and positions and about the situation in Partisan territory in general. This was all the more important because the army desperately lacked radio equipment of all kinds. Light aircraft were frequently used for liaison duties, particularly connecting the surrounding army garrisons and higher command. Often the Army requested one or two aircraft to be temporarily attached to particular army units to closely co-operate with ground troops.\n\nThe ZNDH's fighter force was poorly equipped in every respect, consisting of 12 ex-VVKJ machines including four Ikarus IK-2s, seven ancient Avia BH-33 Es and one Hawker Fury II. Fortunately for this ill-equipped force, there was no aerial opposition and some more modern fighter aircraft were received from 1942 onwards.\n\nColder October and November weather limited aerial activities over the NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their appearance on the Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Vi\u0161egrad.\n\nExpansion: 1942\n\nIn 1942, fighting with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments were aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.\n\nThe first half of 1942 was marked by several deliveries of new or refurbished aircraft from Germany and Italy, aside from those received from Ikarus in Zemun. First of all the ZNDH received 10 brand new Caproni Ca.311 M medium bombers from Italy. These aircraft had been ordered and paid for by the Yugoslav Government for service in the VVKJ, but the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia prevented delivery. The ZNDH also purchased 20 AVIA FL.3 basic trainers, nine Fiat G.50bis fighters and one Fiat G.50B two-seat fighter trainer. The Fiat aircraft were to provide the ZNDH's fighter pilots with some operational training on more modern aircraft.\n\nOther batches of overhauled ex-VVKJ aircraft also arrived from the Ikarus aircraft plant in Zemun, including 11 Dornier Do 17K, three Bristol Blenheim Mk I and one Caproni Ca.310 bombers, 15 Rogo\u017earski PVT and 11 Rogo\u017earski R-100 attack aircraft, which had been fitted with bomb racks to carry  bombs, plus a few Breguet 19s, Potez 25s, Zmaj Fizir FNs and Zmaj Fizir FP-2s. From Prague in Czechoslovakia (under German occupation), the ZNDH received seven Avia Fokker F.7 transports, one Avia Fokker F.9 and one Avia Fokker F.18. Of these, the F.7s and F.18 were pre-war Czech airliners. As the ZNDH suffered from a total lack of transport aircraft, these were immediately pressed into service, after only minor adjustments. Some were even used to provide scheduled air-line services.\n\nThe nine Fiat G.50bis fighters took off from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before crossing the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft had to wait until 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 gull wing fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogo\u017earski R-100 parasol wing fighter-trainers.\n\nThanks to this extended aircraft park the ZNDH could now form new units: in January the 1st Group, comprising the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 19th Squadrons was formed at Zagreb, and then the 2nd Group with the 4th, 5th and 6th squadrons and the 3rd Group with the 7th, 8th and 9th Squadrons at Sarajevo's Rajlovac airfield, whilst the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka's Zaluzani airfield in June 1942 to cover operations in central Croatia and western Bosnia.\n\nThese reinforcements came just in time to participate in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. Initially, the Regia Aeronautica also participated in this campaign, but after an incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica, the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground. At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavian territory. In support of the ground forces, the ZNDH flew 121 combat missions in January, 100 missions in February and 350 in March. Although the Axis ground forces generally succeeded in their operations in January and February, in March they were forced to release the pressure as other Partisan units attacked several solitary NDH garrisons, threatening to destroy them.\n\nAside from constant bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft were also used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As a result of the determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.\n\nAs the weather improved towards the summer, flying activity intensified. Some 325 missions were flown during April, with a further 350 sorties during May, including  direct combat support, reconnaissance and supply missions, as well as leaflet dropping. Most of the missions were performed by the 2nd and 3rd Group's squadrons based at Sarajevo, which was the strongest operational base at that time. The Zagreb air base was principally employed in attacking Partisan positions in western Slavonia and Bosnia.\n\nThe 10 new Caproni Ca.311Ms were tried out during the successive attacks on Partisan territory. They were equally divided between 3rd Squadron (Zagreb) and 7th Squadron (Rajlovac). During September and October Blenheims from 8th Squadron and the Dornier Do 17Ks from 3rd and 9th Squadrons were extensively used to attack Partisan positions in Biha\u0107, Bugojno, Livno and Duvno and Bosnia. Owing to the availability of increased numbers of aircraft, the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka comprising the 13th, 16th, 17th and 18th Squadrons. Not only did this medium bomber force fly reconnaissance and bombing missions against Partisan forces, but also flew deep into  territory under Partisan control and attacked railway stations, road traffic, agricultural depots and food stocks. The Partisan forces were aware of the threat to their operations that the ZNDH provided and were constantly trying to improve their anti-aircraft defence, which relied mainly on machineguns.\n\nDecember 1942 also saw the return of the HZL bomber squadron to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory right up to the end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide operational training. It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.\n\nDuring the course of 1942, the ZNDH flew some 4,800 sorties, of which 30% were combat missions, with 35 aircraft being lost. Of these losses, 19 were to Partisan ground fire, 12 to accidents and four deserted. By the end of the year the ZNDH aircraft park consisted of 191 aircraft, formed into 14 squadrons.\n\n1942 had seen the first desertions of aircraft from the ZNDH, the first on 23 May when a Breguet and a Potez had defected to the Partisan forces. The army conducted an intensive search for the aircraft and in response the Partisans produced two decoy scale-model aircraft, made of wood and canvas, which were duly destroyed by ZNDH bombers. Both \"destroyed\" aircraft were able to perform a number of attacks on army units (armed with hand-made pipe bombs) before either being shot down (the Breguet on 4 June) or destroyed on the ground (the Potez on 6 July). The two other defections occurred in July and October, with a Blenheim bomber in each case flying to Turkey.\n\nZNDH paratroops\nIn January 1942, the ZNDH formed a parachute unit, known as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Company (, 1 PLS). It had a strength of 120 men and was based in the northern town of Koprivnica, near the border with Hungary. An Avia Fokker F.7 tri-motor transport aircraft was assigned to the unit on a permanent basis, with other transports assigned as required. The paratroops were equipped with rifles, sub-machine guns, light machine guns and light mortars. After a period of training, 1 PLS made a demonstration mass tactical jump on 6 July 1943 at Borongaj airfield, Zagreb. Forty five paratroopers made a successful jump from three Avia Fokker transports.\n\nOn 6 November 1943, three brigades of the Partisans, supported by artillery and heavy machine-guns mounted an attack on the town of Koprivnica, which they took on 9 November. The paratroops of 1 PLS held out at their base for three days before withdrawing into Hungary and continuing the battle with other NDH and German defending forces until 29 November. They received direct air support from ZNDH Dornier Do 17Ks, as well as supplies from light aircraft, but were unable to prevent the loss of their base, together with 20 men, all of their parachute equipment and their transport aircraft. The ZNDH also lost a Dornier Do 17K bomber and a B\u00fccker B\u00fc 131 biplane shot down during this period.\n\nThe unit was re-deployed in 1944 to Borongaj airfield in Zagreb and in June 1944 grew in strength with the addition of three further companies and was re-designated as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Battalion (, 1 PLB). They were responsible for the ground defence of this important air base and also performed ceremonial guard duties in Zagreb itself. By late January 1945 the unit was equipped with white winter jackets for camouflage and attached to the NDH Motorized Brigade, seeing its first action on this new sector, south of Zagreb. 1 PLB remained in constant action against the advancing Partisans until the last unit surrendered in Austria on 14 May 1945, one week after the official end of World War II.\n\n1943\n\nAt the beginning of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected and that was the primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding the fact that there was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by the beginning of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in the beginning of 1943.\n\nThis was because the situation began to change in favour of the Allies. They had landed in North Africa while the Soviets were undertaking their great winter offensive, endangering, and eventually defeating, the German 6th Army around Stalingrad.\n\nThe Partisan movement in Yugoslavia, aside from some smaller territories, established a large liberated territory extending west of the rivers Neretva and Bosna, in the direction of the cities of Zagreb and Rijeka. The Partisan force had grown stronger \u2013 it had more than 60,000 armed fighters in this so-called \"Tito's State\" who were both well trained and supported by artillery. On 20 January 1943, the German HQ in Yugoslavia launched an offensive codenamed Case White (), intending to regain the lost territory. The attack was supported by aircraft from the Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica and the ZNDH. Aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd Groups from Sarajevo and the 6th Group from Banja Luka were involved in bombing raids as well as leaflet dropping missions.\n\nThe Banja Luka air base was reinforced by a newly formed 5th Group after the end of Case White. The ZNDH now consisted of three air bases with six Groups and 14 squadrons. During 1943 new aircraft continued to arrive, with 30 overhauled Dornier Do 17E bombers delivered from Germany and divided between the 3rd Squadron (Zagreb), and the 13th and 15th Squadrons (Banja Luka). From Italy came 34 long promised ex-VVKJ B\u00fccker B\u00fc 131 Jungmans and 25 Saiman 200 light biplane trainers and liaison aircraft, which were dispatched to all three air bases. They were also used to deliver mail and fresh meat to isolated/surrounded towns and garrisons.\n\nAlthough the ZNDH had a brief role in the subsequent anti-Partisan offensive, Case Black () in mid-1943, its main involvement was on the front in the central NDH. As always, the Partisan resistance displayed frustrating survivability and effectiveness and new events started to influence the fighting in Yugoslavia. The Partisan forces were well aware of the constant threat of air attack posed by the ZNDH's medium bomber force and on 10 August 1943 undertook a devastating night attack by a brigade on Sarajevo's Rajlovac airfield. The three and a half hour assault on the airfield left 10 ZNDH bombers, plus another five Luftwaffe bombers and transports, destroyed, with another 17 aircraft damaged. Although some aircrews returned fire from the machine-gun turrets of their aircraft, Partisan losses were less than 20. Afterwards ZNDH Command complained that the German ordered dispersal of aircraft around the airfield's perimeter, in case of air attack, made the aircraft especially vulnerable to just this type of ground attack.\n\nBy mid-1943, following the capture of southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger and was trying to persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Bene\u0161-Mr\u00e1z Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.\n\nMid-September 1943 saw the dismissal of Kren from command of the ZNDH. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Adalbert Rogulja, who initiated a major reorganisation.\n\nFollowing the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft were found at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 machines were incorporated into the ZNDH. This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters, as well as six Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters. Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 bombers were also added into the ZNDH. The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20-25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans.\n\nThe capitulation of Italy also brought with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew bailing out. One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to the vicinity of the Dalmatian coast.\n\nAttacks on Partisan forces continued, and on 3 October seven Dornier Do 17Zs caught 2. bataljon of Brigada Bra\u0107a Radi\u0107 (2nd battalion of the Radi\u0107 Brothers Brigade) on the move at \u0160emovec, on the Vara\u017edin-Ludbreg road. In over one hour's concentrated aerial bombardment, the battalion sustained some 60 casualties, including 42 dead.\n\nAlthough the ZNDH was now able to mount a credible threat against the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving from the other side of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters \u2013 aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.\n\nBy the end of 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft, having lost 61 shot down, destroyed on the ground, in accidents and five desertions.\n\n1944\n\nWith the capitulation of Italy, the ZNDH lost an important source of new aircraft and the tide turned significantly when Allied air raids on targets in the Balkans became a reality. The Luftwaffe fighter squadrons stationed in Ljubljana, Zagreb, southern Austria and northern Italy fought heavy battles to stop the American USAAF heavy bomber armada. The ZNDH was also included in the defence with the newly formed 11th Fighter Group () consisting of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Fighter Squadrons () equipped with Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 aircraft.\n\n1944 also saw the return of the HZL fighter squadron to the NDH from service on the Eastern Front. It was redesignated Kroat. JGr 1 and its operational fighter squadron was redesignated 2./(Kroat.)JGr. Soon after arrival 2./(Kroat.)JGr sent its ZNDH pilots to collect 12 brand new Macchi C.202 fighters direct from the plant near Milan in Italy. The Italian designed and built Macchi C.202 fighter was the first up-to-date fighter available to the ZNDH. These aircraft retained their Luftwaffe markings whilst in service with the unit. A second training/operational conversion squadron was also formed, designated 3./(Kroat.)JGr and equipped with Fiat G.50, Macchi C.200 and Fiat CR.42 fighters. After a period of operational conversion, the squadron commenced operations against the frequent incursions over the NDH by USAAF and RAF aircraft. During a period of intensive activity over the summer of 1944, the squadron claimed some 20 Allied aircraft shot down, while at the same time receiving six further Macchi C.202s, as well as four brand new Macchi C.205s.\n\nThe ZNDH's long obsolete Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 fighter aircraft also attempted to intercept the USAAF bomber formations, often stressing their old engines beyond the limit. They were no match for the escorting Mustang and Thunderbolt USAAF fighters and suffered heavy losses, both in the air and on the ground.\n\nBy the end of 1944 the HZL squadron had handed in its remaining worn-out Macchis for brand new German Messerschmitt Bf 109G & K fighters. A total of 21 Bf 109s had been delivered to the ZNDH by year's end.\n\nAllied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation R\u00f6sselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during R\u00f6sselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.\n\nIn June, the ZNDH finally received from Germany the long-promised airdrop containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons all over the NDH. They were immediately put to good use and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.\n\nToward the end of June, the ZNDH received the first of 22 B\u00fccker B\u00fc 181 Bestmann aircraft. The 19th and 20th Transport Squadrons received five each, with the remainder issued to the 1st Pilot School. Besides liaison duties, they were used to transport fresh meat from Bosnia to Zagreb, where there was a food shortage.\n\nFifteen Ju 87D dive bombers and a few Ju 87R-2 extended range dive bombers are known to have been supplied to the HZL, and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the late summer of 1944.\n\nIn the second half of 1944, the situation on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.\n\nThe Germans also continued to supply second-line aircraft to the ZNDH, including between nine and 12 exotic Fieseler Fi 167 biplane torpedo bombers. These had been originally designed and intended for use aboard the German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, which was never completed. After that they were sold to the NDH, where their short-field and load-carrying abilities made them ideal not only for attack missions, but also for transporting ammunition and other supplies to besieged army garrisons. Many of these missions were flown between their arrival in September 1944 and the end of the War (under the right conditions, the aircraft could descend almost vertically). During one such mission, near Sisak on 10 October 1944, an Fi 167 of the ZNDH  was attacked by five P-51 Mustang Mk IIIs of 213 Squadron RAF. The crew of the Fieseler (piloted by an ex-HZL eight-kill Flying ace), exploiting the aircraft's extreme maneuverability to the fullest, had the distinction of shooting down one of the Mustangs before itself being shot down; possibly one of the last biplane \"kills\" of the war.\n\n1945\n\nThe year preceding 1945 had been catastrophic for the ZNDH. Aircraft losses amounted to 234, primarily on the ground, and it began 1945 with 196 machines, including 17 Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs, 12 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, seven Fiat G.50s and two Fiat CR.42 fighters and some 30 multi-engined bombers, although shortages of fuel had begun to hamper operations.\n\nFurther deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses, with 39 arriving by the end of March. These included, in addition to regular Messerschmitt Bf 109G deliveries, the final dozen Dornier Do 17 medium bombers, which arrived in January. In March, despite the loss of 15 Bf 109G&Ks, ten Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, three Fiat CR.42 and two Fiat G.50, the ZNDH's fighter force included 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109G&Ks, three Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, six Fiat G.50 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110G fighters. With the Bf 109G the ZNDH were finally able to face the USAAF and RAF on equal terms, with two squadrons equipped with the type from late 1944. In April, the ZNDH still possessed 176 aircraft.\n\nThe ZNDH's modest transport force was also utilised in assisting with the evacuation of Sarajevo between the 1st and 5th of April, with Dornier Do 17, Savoia Marchetti SM 79 and SM 82, Caproni CA 311 and 313, as well as Junkers W34 aircraft taking part.  \n\nThe ZNDH's Dornier Do 17 medium bombers were still hitting back when and where they could. On 31 December 1944, a Dornier Do 17E destroyed an RAF 148 Squadron Handley Page Halifax bomber on the ground at the Partisan airfield in Grabovnica, near \u010cazma. On 10 February 1945, after a bridge-busting sortie on the Drava, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z bombed the Partisans' 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) near Daruvar, inflicting two dozen casualties. Late in the afternoon of 30 March, four Dornier Do 17Z bombers, escorted by four Bf 109G fighters attacked the Partisans near Gospi\u0107. On 15 April 1945, a force made up of a Dornier Do 17Z, escorted by two Bf 109Gs destroyed two Partisan aircraft at their airfield in Sanski Most. \n\nDespite these raids, the war's outcome had become apparent. Defections of ZNDH personnel and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery took place on 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs, one of which was confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogo\u017earski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built parasol wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and shot on the spot.\n\nThat evening, with the Partisans advancing upon Zagreb, the commanding officer of the ZNDH fighter group gathered his men at Zagreb's Lucko airfield and released them from their oath of loyalty and announced that each was free to go. Some flew their aircraft and crews, including several Dornier Do 17s and a CANT Z.1007 to Italy and surrendered to the Allied forces there. Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans, including several light aircraft and some Bf 109s, whilst others, also including Bf 109s, as well as at least one Dornier Do 17Z, a Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2, a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav-designed and built Zmaj Fizir FP-2, sought sanctuary in Klagenfurt, Austria.\n\nThe ZNDH's four-year campaign, during which it had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft, thus ended with the capture of the airbases around Zagreb on 8 May 1945. Its colourful collection of often vintage aircraft, scattered on deserted airfields, received new markings, a red star, and formed the basis of the new Yugoslav Air Force.\n\nRanks\n\nCommanders\n Vladimir Kren (April 1941\u201313 September 1943)\n  (23 September 1943 \u2013 1 June 1944)\n Vladimir Kren (June 1944\u2013May 1945)\n\nService types\n\nSource:\n\nJournal\nThe ZNDH published a weekly journal called Hrvatska Krila (Croatian Wings).\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Holocaust in Yugoslavia\nCollaboration during World War II\nCollaboration with the Axis Powers\nAviation in Croatia\nAir Force of the Independent State of Croatia\nDisbanded air forces\nYugoslavia invasion\nYugoslavia in World War II", "machine_abstract": "The Air Force of the Independent State (Croatian: Hrvatsko Ratno Zrakoplovstvo, HRZ) was formed in 1991 as part of the Croat-Bosniak Federation and later became one of three armed forces within Bosnia-Herzegovina after its creation on 27 April 1992 by the Dayton Peace Accords.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia\".

Scrub planes generally have a short sole, a relatively narrow but thick blade, a very wide mouth, and a deeply curved edge (of about a 3\u00a0inch to 7 inch radius) to make a deep, gouging cut. \n\nA scrub plane is generally used in diagonal strokes across the face of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other bench planes. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the jack plane, jointer plane, then smoothing plane. \n\nIts function in modern woodworking has been largely replaced by power tools such as the thickness planer. A scrub plane can still be useful for planing boards too wide to fit through a thickness planer.\n\nPlanes", "machine_abstract": "A scrubber is any aircraft that performs the function of cleaning up other aircraft, such as those used by airlines to clean their fleet or military units who perform maintenance on airplanes in flight.\nScrubbers are also known as:", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Scrub plane\".

These books are all illustrated by David Wyatt.\n\nSetting\nThe Larklight trilogy is set in an alternative Victorian-era universe, where mankind has been exploring the solar system for at least a century. Earth is the same as it was in the late 19th century, but only the United Kingdom and its Empire possess the engines to travel across the solar system. The United States, which the British consider to be rebellious colonies, and France, though not technically at war with Britain on Earth, are in a struggle to sabotage the Britons' expansive interests and develop space technology of their own.\nLondon, the centre of the universe, has many spaceports and is the base of many organisations such as the Royal Xenological Society.\n\nLarklight \n\nLarklight is the first book in the series. The story begins in the Larklight manor where they have a visitor. However, soon, white spiders from Saturn invade Larklight and they have to save the known universe from a madman.\n\nStarcross \n\nStarcross, the second book in the trilogy begins when Art Mumby and his prim older sister Myrtle, at their home (Larklight) with their mother and father, receive a strange invitation to the Starcross hotel, located in the asteroid field.\n\nMothstorm \n\nMothstorm, the third book and the last book in the trilogy, was published in hardback in October 2008. The paperback was scheduled to be published on 6 July 2009. They fight giant moths, and a race of blue lizards led by a Rogue Shaper.\n\nFilm adaptations\nWarner Bros. had planned a $200 million adaptation of the first book Larklight, with Shekhar Kapur directing. The movie would have been released in 2010. It is unknown if the rest of the trilogy will be adapted. However Shekhar Kapur said Larklight will be the last expensive movie he will make, so it is unlikely that Starcross and Mothstorm will be adapted unless another director chooses to do so.\n\nThe film was planned to be released January 1, 2010, but after the death of director Anthony Minghella, Shekhar Kapur took over his unfinished movie, New York, I Love You, and Larklight had to be postponed.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Review at Kidsreads.com\n\n \nBook series introduced in 2006\nNovels by Philip Reeve\nNovel series\nAlternate history novels\nFantasy books by series\nSteampunk novels\nFantasy novel trilogies\nScience fiction novel trilogies", "machine_abstract": "The Larklight Trilogy is the first series of science fiction novels by American author David Drake, published in 2002 and 2003 under his own name as well as pseudonymously (as Richard A.

It was created on 13 January 1309 when Fulk le Strange was summoned to parliament. On the death of the fifth baron in 1375, it was inherited by Elizabeth Mowbray, n\u00e9e le Strange. On her death in the year 1383, it was inherited by Ankaret Talbot, n\u00e9e le Strange, daughter of the fourth Baron. On her son's death in 1419, the baron was inherited by Ankaret Talbot, his daughter. On her death in 1421, the barony was inherited by her uncle, John Talbot who was created Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Waterford and hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland. On the death of the 7th earl in 1616, the barony fell into abeyance between his three daughters Mary, Elizabeth and Alethea. In 1651 Alethea became sole heir and therefore, Baroness Strange of Blackmere. The title continued in her descendants until the death of Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk and 22nd Baron Strange of Blackmere in 1777, when it again fell into abeyance. The co-heirs are the descendants of his nieces Winifred, Lady Stourton, and Ann, Lady Petre.\n\nBarons Strange of Blackmere (1309)\n\nFulk le Strange, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere (1267\u20131324)\nJohn le Strange, 2nd Baron Strange of Blackmere (1305\u20131349)\nFulk le Strange, 3rd Baron Strange of Blackmere (1320\u20131349)\nJohn le Strange, 4th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1332\u20131361)\nJohn le Strange, 5th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1353\u20131375)\nElizabeth Mowbray, 6th Baroness Strange of Blackmere n\u00e9e le Strange (1373\u20131383)\nAnkaret Talbot, 7th Baroness Strange of Blackmere n\u00e9e le Strange (1361\u20131413) (daughter of the 4th Baron Strange)\nGilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot, 8th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1383\u20131419)\nAnkaret Talbot, 6th Baroness Talbot, 9th Baroness Strange of Blackmere (1416\u20131421)\nJohn Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, 1st Earl of Waterford, 7th Baron Talbot, 10th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1390\u20131453) (second son of the 7th Baroness Strange) \nJohn Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, 2nd Earl of Waterford, 8th Baron Talbot, 11th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 7th Baron Furnivall (1413\u20131460)\nJohn Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, 3rd Earl of Waterford, 9th Baron Talbot, 12th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 8th Baron Furnivall (1448\u20131473)\nGeorge Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, 4th Earl of Waterford, 10th Baron Talbot, 13th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 9th Baron Furnivall (1468\u20131538)\nFrancis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, 5th Earl of Waterford, 11th Baron Talbot, 14th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 10th Baron Furnivall (1500\u20131560)\nGeorge Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, 6th Earl of Waterford, 12th Baron Talbot, 15th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 11th Baron Furnivall (1522\u20131590)\nGilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, 7th Earl of Waterford, 13th Baron Talbot, 16th Baron Strange of Blackmere, 12th Baron Furnivall (1552\u20131616) (abeyant 1616)\nAlethea Howard, Countess of Arundel, 14th Baroness Talbot, 17th Baroness Strange of Blackmere, 13th Baroness Furnivall n\u00e9e Talbot (1585\u20131654) (abeyance naturally terminated 1651)\nThomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk, 18th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1627\u20131677)\nHenry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, 19th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1628\u20131684)\nHenry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk, 20th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1655\u20131701)\nThomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk, 21st Baron Strange of Blackmere (1683\u20131732)\nEdward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk, 22nd Baron Strange of Blackmere (1686\u20131777)\nabeyant since 1777\n\nReferences\n Patrick Cracroft-Brennan, Strange of Blackmere, Baron (E, 1309 - abeyant 1777) in Cracroft's Peerage.

Short-path distillation systems  often have a variety of names depending on the manufacturer of the system and what compounds are being distilled within them. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate traveling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower at reduced pressure than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which can contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions. To increase the evaporation rate without increasing temperature there are several modern techniques that increase the surface area of the liquid such as thin film, wiped film or 'wiper' film, and rolled film all of which involve mechanically spreading a film of the liquid over a large surface.\n\nSee also\n Fragrance extraction\n\nReferences\n\nDistillation\nSeparation processes\nLaboratory techniques", "machine_abstract": "In the short path distillation process, steam is passed through a bed of solid particles (the catalyst) to produce liquid hydrocarbon products and water vapor.\nThe reaction takes place at temperatures between 450 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C in fixed beds or fluidized beds.

{"id": "Netball in Africa", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball%20in%20Africa", "title": "Netball in Africa", "text": "Netball is a popular women's sport in parts of Africa. Several African nations are ranked amongst the top thirty in the world. As of August 2016, South Africa was ranked number Five, Malawi was ranked number Six, Uganda was ranked Seven, Zambia was ranked Sixteenth, Botswana was ranked twentieth, Zimbabwe was ranked Twenty-first and Swaziland was ranked Thirtieth in the world.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nNetball is one of the most popular women's participation sports in South Africa. While participation rates are high, there is no sense of collective identity by players as netballers and being part of a national netball community. In 2002, 40% of African girls rated netball as their favourite sport.  Many African girls claimed netball as their favourite sport even if they had never played it.\n\nThe history of South Africa's netball involvement mirrors that of other sports played in the country such as rugby union. South Africa was involved with the international netball community early in the sport's history, taking part in the 1960 meeting of Commonwealth countries in Sri Lanka to standardise the rules for the game. South Africa's international involvement was suspended because of apartheid era policies. In 1969, South Africa was expelled from competing internationally in netball. Other countries turned down tours to South Africa. Some countries, including England and New Zealand, continued to occasionally compete against South Africa, which led to their national players also being banned from international competitions. When they rejoined the community in the 1990s, internal racial tensions continued to plague the sport on the local level.\n\nIn 1994, the national team had their first international tour after a 20-year absence from international competition. The success of the South African Springboks in the 1995 Rugby World Cup had a positive impact on support for other South African national teams at international competitions, including the nation's appearance at the 1995 Netball World Championships. South Africa provided a major upset when they beat New Zealand in pool play during the tournament, with South Africa finishing second behind Australia. In 1995, the South African Police Service (SAPS) held its first National Netball Championships in Pretoria. The development of SAPS netball was not taken seriously until 1999 when they affiliated to Netball South Africa as an associated member. The Southern African Development Community has a sport competition with over 600 correctional officers from member countries participating. The 2000 national championships were held in Cape Town. In 2000, New Zealand's national side toured South Africa for the first time. The two countries played three test matches and New Zealand won them all. In 2001, a Tri-Nations Series was launched between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, which was also won by New Zealand.\n\nBotswana\n\nNetball is primarily played by women in Botswana. Girls are introduced into the game at primary schools, as part of the school curriculum. Men have traditionally served as officials, coaches and administrators for the sport. They also had their own teams. This started to change in the 2000s, with men only teams having been discontinued in favour of mixed gendered teams. The Botswana Netball Association is the national organisation responsible for netball in Botswana. It was founded in the 1970s. It is a member of IFNA and COSANA. Botswana has 30 local graded umpires and 22 locally trained coaches who have been certified by Netball South Africa. Botswana competed in the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament in 2008. Spar \u2013 \u201cGood for You\u201d Netball League is the most important national netball competition in Botswana. Naming rights for the league were given to Sar in 2010. The league is divided into two divisions, north and south. Games for the 2010 season began on 22 May. The league championships were held on 27 November 2010 at the BONA Courts in Gaborone. As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number twentieth in the world.\n\nMalawi\n\nNetball is the most popular women's sport in Malawi. The Malawi word for netball is mpira wa manja, where Mpira means \"Ball\". This name links the sport to women and those who are responsible for taking care of their families. Malawi's national team is called the Queens. In 1992, the ADMARC Tigresses won the Southern African Netball Associations trophy. A Malawian player was also named the best player in that tournament. In April 2008, Lesotho hosted the Malawi Under-21 national netball team. The match was part of the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament. In 2011, high-profile national player Mary Waya retired from the national team to take up a position as national U20 coach. That year, goal shooter Mwayi Kumwenda received a scholarship to play in the Victorian Netball League in Australia, becoming Malawi's first netball export player. Kumwenda joined the Mainland Tactix in 2014 to become the 1st African Import player into the ANZ Championship and the team has confirmed their wish to see her return for the 2015 season.  As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number six in the world.\n\nTanzania\n\nNetball was one of the most popular sports in Tanzania. The sport was introduced to the country after World War I, when the country was under British colonial rule. The sport was intended for leisure and first played in schools. For this reason, almost all primary schools in the country have a court. Recruitment for the national team and other high level teams started at that level. The Netball Association of Tanzania (CHANETA) was created in 1966. Women have historically dominated in leadership positions in CHANETA but men are still involved, especially in roles like coaching. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a push by the International Olympic Committee and the British Council to promote sport and women's sport in Tanzania. Despite netball being the most popular women's sport at the time, no investment was made into the sport. Netball's popularity declined during the 1990s as a result of economic liberalisation. Courts were not maintained, leagues were closed and there were fewer competitions. Attempts to raise netball's popularity in the country again have been hampered by the fact that sport is culturally more acceptable for men. Top level teams in the country, prior to the 1990s, have included Tanzania Harbour Authority, and Tanzania Postal and Telecommunication. Tanzania's national team is called the Taifa Queens. In their opening match in the NTUC Fairprice Foundation Nations Cup 2010, against Singapore, they won 52\u201336. Mwanaidi Hassan was the team's star player in the tournament. Some of the top performances for the Tanzania national netball team include third place at the 2010 Nations Cup. As of 2016, the women's national team was not ranked in the world.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography", "machine_abstract": "The sport of netball is played on the African continent, primarily by women and girls.\nHistory\n\nIn South Africa it was introduced as a school game during World War I (1914\u20131918) when many British soldiers were stationed there.

{"id": "Robin Hood, West Yorkshire", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin%20Hood%2C%20West%20Yorkshire", "title": "Robin Hood, West Yorkshire", "text": "Robin Hood is a village in West Yorkshire, England, within the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, with Wakefield WF3, and Leeds LS26 postcodes. It is situated on the A61 and A654 between Leeds and Wakefield, close to Rothwell and Lofthouse.\n\nIt forms part of the Ardsley and Robin Hood ward of Leeds City Council and the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe centre of Robin Hood is believed to be the Halfway House public house, situated at the main junction of the A61 and A654. The public house gained its name from its location being half-way between Leeds and Wakefield, located exactly 4 miles in either direction on the A61. It used to be known as \"The Old Halfway House\" and a public house or inn has been located on that site for centuries.\n\nHistory\n\nRobin Hood was originally part of nearby Carlton village, the original inhabitants were chiefly miners and quarrymen and as such it was built on its large mining history. Its mines at their peak, employing several hundred underground workers for the firm J&J Charlesworth, but the last mine closed in the 1960s.  There has been considerable residential and commercial development in recent years, and has now grown to a population of around 3,573 according to the 2011 census.\n\nName\nThe name Robin Hood was first applied to a spring or well situated near the old quarries, it is believed the well-trough, had an iron ladle chained to it. The well no longer exists, and is believed to have been covered up with quarry refuse. It is believed that the well still runs underground and feeds the local streams in the area. There was local opinion that the ceremony of well-dressing, and a country dance called Robin Hood might have been performed there.\n\nThe folk hero connection\nThe area has a suspected link with the medieval folk hero Robin Hood, as some of the original legends do mention an \"Outwoods\" (quite possibly the Outwood of Wakefield nearby) and the original legends also mention a \"Stane Lea\" (potentially the nearby village of Stanley). Also, most of the original Robin Hood ballads have him operating in and around Barnsdale forest which is close to Wakefield and surrounding areas.\n\nMining history and Robin Hood Colliery \nMining has been performed at various locations in Robin Hood, dating all the way back to the late 1600s. The most notable mining operation was Robin Hood Colliery, which was located opposite the Halfway House pub, and on land located between the A61 and Thorpe Lower Lane A654. The mine opened in 1854 and was operated by J&J Charlesworth, who owned many large collieries in the area. Most of them named after his daughters, including the Robin Hood Colliery which was known as \"Jane Pit\". The pit closed in the 1960s after being nationalised by the National Coal Board in the early 1900s, it stood derelict on the site until the 1980s and used as a ventilation shaft for other main collieries in the area. It is now occupied by a large housing estate built in the 1990s.\n\nRobin Hood Quarries and Brickworks \nRobin Hood was also home to some large stone quarries and an associated brickworks. The main quarry site was located to the left of Thorpe Lower Lane where it meets Middleton Lane, and it was known as \"Robin Hood Quarries\". This operated from the late 1800s and closed in the 1950s. Associated with the quarry was Armitage Brickworks, their offices and stone yard was located at the back of the Robin Hood Colliery and extended up Thorpe Lower Lane towards the quarries. Most of this old site is now occupied by the M1 Motorway built in the 1960s. Their major Brickworks operation site was located next to the quarries and further along Middleton Lane where it meets Thorpe Lane.\n\nRobin Hood station and railways \nRobin Hood had its own passenger station, located between Leadwell Lane A654 and Matty Lane (now known as Hopefield Walk). It opened in 1904 and only lasted for 6 months, it continued to be used for excursions and coal traffic. Finally closed and further demolished in the 1960s. The station was part of a large network of railway lines that operated in the Robin Hood, Lofthouse and Rothwell areas known as the East and West Yorkshire Union Railway. The line was built mainly for colliery traffic and linked all the major collieries in the area, starting at Lofthouse and joining the Midland Main Line just past Stourton in Leeds. A large embankment carried the railway from the A61 near the Gardeners Arms Pub and through to Leadwell Lane A654 where a bridge crossed over and into the station, the embankment still stands today and is now part of the Rothwell Greenway. One half of the old Leadwell Lane bridge abutment still stands today at the end of the embankment.\n\nThere were numerous branches off this railway located all over the Robin Hood area, including a road crossing on the A61 at what is known as Robin Hood Bridge (where West Beck crosses underneath the road). There was also a further road crossing on Thorpe Lower Lane just before the present M1 underpass, and a large railway junction beyond Robin Hood Station towards Rothwell. It also had branches from Thorpe Lower Lane and up to Castle Pit located off Middleton Lane and the Armitage Brickworks and Robin Hood Quarries.\n\nNot much remains of this line today, apart from a few rails buried just under the surface of Milner Lane and overgrown embankments and cuttings along the route to Rothwell.\n\nTelegraph Repeater Station and RAF Bunker \nThere was a large GPO Telegraph Repeater Station located on the corner of Sharpe Lane where it meets the A61 Wakefield Road. It is believed that this was used to boost the strength of electric telephone signals. It also had an associated underground bunker and shelter known as \"RAF Rothwell\" located just behind the GPO building. It was a large concrete building with blast proof doors and was believed to be associated with RAF Menwith Hill. The GPO Repeater building was demolished around 2007, the concrete bunker still stands today and is now located on a private residence.\n\nFootball club\nRobin Hood Athletic Football Club were crowned champions of the West Yorkshire Football League Division One in 2013\u201314 and have since played in its Premier Division.\n\nThe team play from the Coach Ground located just behind the Coach and Horses pub on the A61.\n\nNotable former residents\nKarl Davey\nMark Davey\nErnie Field\nSidney Parkinson\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe ancient parish of Rothwell at GENUKI: Robin Hood was in this parish\nRobin Hood Athletic Football Club:  \n\nPlaces in Leeds\nRothwell, West Yorkshire", "machine_abstract": "The Robin Hood is the longest river in England and Wales that flows entirely within its own county (Yorkshire).

{"id": "Edwin Foresman Schoch", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin%20Foresman%20Schoch", "title": "Edwin Foresman Schoch", "text": "Edwin Foresman Schoch (September 13, 1916 \u2013 September 13, 1951) was a United States Navy aeronautical engineer, combat pilot and test pilot.\n\nAs a Lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, he flew in combat against Japanese forces in the Pacific then, with war's end, he became one of the most renowned test pilots at McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, and test-flew several experimental and early-model jet fighters including the XF-85 Goblin.\n\nEarly years \nBorn in Oakmont, Pennsylvania in 1916 to a family in the railroad industry that moved several times as he was growing up Edwin F. Schoch graduated from South Park High School in Buffalo, New York, then worked for several years as a railroad clerk, saving money during the Great Depression so that he could attend college. He enrolled in Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia, and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and a 2nd Lieutenant\u2019s commission in the United States Army.\n\nHaving learned to fly at VPI through the ROTC program, he wanted to fly fighter aircraft. He thought his chances of being able to do so were better in the Navy than in the Army, so upon graduation in the spring of 1941, he resigned his Army commission, enrolled in the Navy Reserve as a Seaman 2nd Class, and, having already learned to fly in VPI\u2019s ROTC program, was quickly accepted into the Navy\u2019s flight training program.\n\nWorld War II \nOnce he\u2019d earned his pilot\u2019s wings in the Navy, Schoch was assigned to Fighting Squadron 19, then forming for anticipated combat against the Japanese in the Pacific as part of Air Group 19. With his engineering degree, Schoch was designated as the squadron engineering officer, and flew 46 combat missions with the squadron from the USS Lexington (CV-16) in the summer and fall of 1944.\n\nFlying the Grumman F6F Hellcat, he shot down four Japanese aircraft during the squadron's combat tour, and hit a Japanese aircraft carrier with a bomb, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\nAfter his combat tour, in January 1945, Schoch was assigned to Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150, which was forming in the United States, in preparation for an invasion of Japan in 1945. He began training, once again as the engineering officer, in the new Vought F4U-4 at bases on the east coast of the U. S. and aboard the newly commissioned USS Lake Champlain (CV-39). Japan\u2019s surrender made both the invasion and Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150 unnecessary.\n\nThe war ended before either the squadron or the aircraft carrier saw combat duty, and Schoch left the Navy in November 1945.\n\nMcDonnell career \nSchoch was hired immediately after the war by McDonnell Aircraft Corporation as an aeronautical engineer and quickly moved up to a test pilot position as the company grew. He was the tenth pilot to fly the company\u2019s FH-1 Phantom, the U.S. Navy\u2019s first jet fighter to be carrier-qualified. He was the second pilot to fly the F2H Banshee, the Phantom\u2019s successor. The Phantom never saw combat service, but the Banshee was widely used during the Korean War (1950\u20131953) as a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nSchoch was the only pilot to fly the company\u2019s XF-85 Goblin, at what is now Edwards Air Force Base. The Goblin was an experimental \u201cparasite\u201d fighter contemplated for use by the U. S. Air Force in conjunction with the B-36 bomber. With the giant bomber still unavailable at the inception of the test program, for the test phase the special \"trapeze\" needed to launch and recover the small fighter was fitted on a Boeing EB-29. \n\nFlying the Goblin required skill, due to the difficulty of the hook-up manoeuvre and the lack of proper landing gear if hook up was not completed. In seven free flights only the second, third and fourth resulted in successful hook-ups with the EB-29 mother ship, while the remaining four were concluded by belly-landings on the special landing skid of the parasite.\n\nSchoch was also one of the lead pilots for McDonnell\u2019s XF-88 program.\n\nBoth the XF-85 and the XF-88 programs were cancelled in the early 1950s, but the XF-88 showed enough promise to be revived a few years later, and with some modification, eventually became the F-101 Voodoo.\n\nIn between McDonnell\u2019s experimental test programs at Edwards Air Force Base, Schoch flew numerous routine and maintenance test flights for aircraft already in production at the company\u2019s St. Louis facility.\n\nFurthermore, while in service at the Naval Air Test Center in January 1948 he flew the North American FJ-1 Fury.\n\nDeath and honors \nWhile making a test flight over rural Missouri on his 35th birthday to investigate elevator-related issues, metal fatigue caused the tail section of the F2H-2 he was flying to fail, and then come apart in the air. \nHe was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\nThe sequence of events is unclear, as the few witnesses were a mile or more away and there were no flight data recorders in use at that time. The crash site is about 60 miles northwest of St. Louis.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nIllustrated Biography of Edwin Foresman Schoch\nDropping A Smaller Fighter From The Bomb Bay \u2013 The Out-Of-This-World XF-85 Goblin\nParasite in the Sky\n\n1916 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Oakmont, Pennsylvania\nUnited States Navy officers\nUnited States Navy pilots of World War II\nVirginia Tech alumni\nAmerican test pilots\nAmerican aerospace engineers\nMilitary personnel from Pennsylvania\nVictims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1951", "machine_abstract": "The Edwin Foresman Company was founded in 1917 by the American educator and businessman, Edwin Foresman (1873\u20131953).

The organization is also a member of the Nationalist Front. The group gained significant attention after it was revealed that James Alex Fields had marched with them at the Unite the Right rally before being arrested on murder charges. The group has its roots in the alt-right movement.\n\nHistory \n\nVanguard America was founded in 2015, in California. The group was founded and is run by Dillon Irizarry. In 2017, Irizarry claimed membership of 200+ members. Irizarry also states that local branches exist in Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. In July 2017, it also created a women's division.\n\nThe group had a presence in the Unite the Right rally in August 2017. James Alex Fields, who was later responsible for killing a counter protester and injuring 19 others in a vehicle-ramming attack, was seen marching with the group. The leadership later disavowed him, stating that he was not a member of the group. The group took part in the \"White Lives Matter\" rally in October 2017.\n\nThe group supports the right-wing nationalist concept of blood and soil. The group has put up racist and anti-Semitic fliers at various universities. On December 18, 2017, its account was suspended by Twitter.\n\nVanguard America has produced two competing splinter groups, the more popular Patriot Front, founded in August 2017, and the National Socialist Legion, founded in January 2018.\n\nSee also \n Neo-fascism\n Neo-Nazi groups of the United States\n Patriot Front, a splinter group\nNational Socialist Legion, a splinter group\n White supremacy in the United States\n\nReferences \n\n2015 establishments in California\nAlt-right organizations\nWhite supremacist groups in the United States\nWhite nationalism in the United States\nNeo-Nazi organizations in the United States\nOrganizations established in 2015\nOpposition to feminism\nCriticism of feminism", "machine_abstract": "The Vanguard America satellite was launched on December 16, 2009 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California by the United States Air Force's Delta II rocket as part of the NROL-44 mission.

{"id": "Points Offthebench", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points%20Offthebench", "title": "Points Offthebench", "text": "Points Offthebench (February 27, 2009 \u2013 October 26, 2013) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for his performances over sprint distances. Campaigned exclusively in California, he was lightly raced in his early career, running twice a two-year-old in 2011 and once in the following year. As a four-year-old in 2013 he began by racing against moderate opposition before emerging as one of the best sprinters in North America with Grade I victories in the Bing Crosby Stakes and the Santa Anita Sprint Championship.  Preparing for the Breeders' Cup, he fractured his leg during a workout and was euthanized.  At the end of the year, he was posthumously named American Champion Sprint Horse.\n\nBackground\nPoints Offthebench was a lightly made dark bay or brown gelding with a white star bred in California by Gary Rocks. He was sired by Benchmark, a multiple graded stakes winner who had previously sired the Grade I winners Brother Derek (Santa Anita Derby) and Idiot Proof (Ancient Title Stakes). Points Offthebench is the second foal of the unraced mare Mo Chuisle: her first foal, Bench Points, won five races including the Grade III Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes. During his racing career, Points Offthebench was owned by Donnie Crievier and Charles V. Martin and trained by Tim Yakteen. He was considered a major contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint but was fatally injured in a training accident at Santa Anita Park on October 26. Three months later, he was named American Champion Sprint Horse for 2013.\n\nRacing career\n\n2011: two-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench made two appearances as a two-year-old, both of them on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack in August. He began in a five and a half furlong maiden race in which he started at odds of 4.1/1 and finished third of eight runners. Eighteen days later he appeared in a similar event over six furlongs in which he was ridden, as on his debut, by the Mexican jockey Alonso Quinonez. Starting the 2.4/1 second favorite, he raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths.\n\n2012: three-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench began his second season in a six-and-a-half-furlong Optional claiming race on the dirt at Santa Anita Park on February 17. Ridden by Joel Rosario, he tracked the odds-on favorite, Three Vases, before taking the lead on the final turn and drawing away in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths. He did not race again in 2012.\n\n2013: four-year-old season\nAlmost a year after his last race, Points Offthebench returned in a six-furlong claiming race at Santa Anita in which he finished second by half a length to the favored Italian Rules. In April, he was ridden by Tyler Baze in another claimer over six and a half furlongs at the same track and started second favorite at odds of 2.2/1 in a field of ten runners. He raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and holding off the challenge of the favorite, Oliver's Tale, to win by half a length. The gelding remained in claiming company for his next race over six furlongs at Hollywood Park Racetrack on May 27. Ridden again by Baze, he took the lead in the straight and went clear in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths from Cyclometer, with the favored Italian Rules a neck away in third.\n\nPoints Offthebench was then moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Bing Crosby Stakes over six furlongs at Del Mar on July 28 in which he was ridden for the first time by Mike Smith. The gelding was fourth choice in the betting for the race behind previous Grade I winners Goldencents (Santa Anita Derby), Jimmy Creed (Malibu Stakes), and Comma to the Top (CashCall Futurity). Points Offthebench tracked the leaders before moving up on the outside to take the lead entering the straight. In the closing stages, he was challenged by Goldencents but prevailed by a head, with a gap of over three lengths back to Jimmy Creed in third. Tim Yakteen, who recorded the first Grade I success of his eight-year training career, commented: \"He was training great, we drew a great post and he was ready for the task, so I felt confident going into the race. He ran huge and Mike gave him a great ride.\"\n\nOn October 5 at Santa Anita, Points Offthebench met Goldencents again in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship (formerly the Ancient Title Stakes) in a field which also included Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Trinniberg. Ridden again by Smith, the gelding moved up on the outside on the turn before overtaking the leader Distinctiv Passion in the final furlong. Despite lugging towards the inside in the closing stages, he held on to win by half a length from Goldencents. After the race, Smith commented: \"He has some turn of foot, and I hit the front too soon, but he still held on. He pulled up nice and happy, well within himself. He's a very talented horse.\"\n\nAfter four consecutive wins, including two at Grade I level, Points Offthebench was considered a leading contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Santa Anita on November. In a routine four-furlong workout at the track on October 26, the gelding was approaching the sixteenth pole when he broke down on his right foreleg with what was described as \"an inordinately loud, sickening sound\". He had sustained a condlyar fracture to his right foreleg and was euthanized within fifteen minutes. His owner, Charles Martin, said, \"He's been a tremendous horse. He was the nicest horse you would ever find... He was as much a pet as an awesome racehorse... everyone in the barn is devastated\".\n\nAssessment and honors\nOn January 18, 2014, almost three month after his death, Points Offthebench was named American Champion Sprint Horse at the Eclipse Awards, taking 125 of the 249 votes. He was the first horse to be posthumously awarded an Eclipse Award since Left Bank in 2002. In the 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Points Offthebench was given a rating of 117, making him the highest-rated sprinter competing on dirt.\n\nPedigree\n\nReferences\n\n2009 racehorse births\n2013 racehorse deaths\nRacehorses bred in California\nRacehorses trained in the United States\nThoroughbred family 9-c\nEclipse Award winners", "machine_abstract": "The Points of View series is designed to provide the reader with some insight into how various people view and approach their work in the world of education, business or government.\nIn this edition we speak to Dr David Hargreaves who has been involved in educational research since his graduation from Cambridge University over 40 years ago.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Points Offthebench\".

{"id": "Brad Lidge", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad%20Lidge", "title": "Brad Lidge", "text": "Bradley Thomas Lidge (born December 23, 1976) nicknamed \"Lights Out\" is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002\u20132012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge is currently a host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio.\n\nLidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95\u201397 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87\u00a0mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5.\n\nEarly life\nLidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School. Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek's outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign.\n\nCollege career\nLidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8\u20132 record and 93 strikeouts in  innings.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHouston Astros (2002\u20132007)\n\nEarly career\nLidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n2003\u201304\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA.\n\nFollowing the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.  Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, \"I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.\"\n\n2005\n\nIn his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984.\n\nLater in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0\u20132 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n2006\nLidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.\n\n2007 \nThe Astros avoided contract arbitration with Lidge on January 17, 2007, by signing him to a one-year contract worth $5.35 million. After seeing Lidge struggle in spring training and blow his first save of the season, manager Phil Garner chose to make Dan Wheeler the new Astros closer, while offering Lidge opportunities to relieve in the sixth or seventh innings of games. He regained the closer role at the start of June, but was placed on the disabled list that same month after suffering a strained left oblique muscle. Although Lidge described to reporters that the injury bothered him less towards the end of the day, Garner chose to shut his closer down in order to keep the muscle strain from becoming a larger issue.\n\nAfter returning to the active roster on July 13, Lidge picked up his first save of the season on July 18, against the Washington Nationals. With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, there was speculation that the Astros, who had the third-lowest record in the National League (NL) would trade Lidge, but owner Drayton McLane told reporters, \"I see no reason we should even consider it. He's been one of the best closers in baseball.\" Instead, the club traded Wheeler to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for infielder Ty Wigginton. Despite his early-season struggles and injuries, Lidge finished the 2007 season 5\u20133 with 19 saves in 27 opportunities. He also held his opponents to a .218 batting average and record and average of 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9). After the season, Lidge underwent surgery to repair a cartilage tear in his right knee, with the anticipation that he would be healthy for the beginning of spring training.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2008\u20132011)\n\n2008\n\nIn February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4\u20133.  \n \nOn September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies.  He is the first closer since \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.\n\nHe saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).\n\nLidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.\n\nHe received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award. Baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Closer of the Year. Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's Outstanding Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 26, 2009. He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News Sportsperson of the Year award.\n\nLidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.\n\n2009\nLidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in  innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee.\n\nAfter returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team's closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win-loss record of 0\u20138, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.\n\nIn the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8\u20136.  In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth inning.  He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5\u20134 victory.  Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7\u20134 win and a 3\u20131 lead in the series.  The Yankees went on to win the series in six games.\n\n2010\nLidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010, and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season. He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game.  On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAfter spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities.\n\n2011 \nAfter entering spring training fully healthy, Lidge was shut down on March 25 with pain in the back of his right shoulder, which he said was a new occurrence. An MRI revealed a posterior rotator cuff strain that did not require surgery, but would take three to six weeks to heal, and he began the 2011 MLB season on the disabled list. He underwent an eight-game rehab assignment with Lakewood and Reading, going 0\u20130 with a 3.52 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 7.2 innings before returning to the Phillies roster on July 22. Although his pitch velocity remained constant during Lidge's rehab appearances, with his fastball hovering around , Lidge and sports journalists alike voiced concerns over the pitcher's control: in one appearance for Reading, he threw only 15 strikes in 28 pitches.\n\nLidge did not return to the closer role even after coming off of the disabled list; instead, his setup man Ryan Madson filled the ninth inning, while Lidge found himself in competition with Antonio Bastardo over who would pitch the eighth. Despite seeing a decreased velocity on his fastball, Lidge found success in later innings with his slider, working up to an 11.29 K/9 by the end of September. Lidge's strong relationship with Madson helped both players adjust to their new positions. Lidge told reporters during the 2011 NLCS that, while Madson was closing, he would find himself \"shaking pitches off with [Madson]. I feel that I am there with him.\" Lidge played in 25 games during the 2011 season, during which he posted a 0\u20132 record with a 1.40 ERA and struck out 23 batters in  innings.\n\nWashington Nationals (2012) \n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Washington Nationals signed Lidge to a one-year, $1 million contract, plus additional incentives. He had not been signed as a closer for Washington, but after Drew Storen suffered from elbow inflammation during spring training, the team prepared to use Lidge and Henry Rodr\u00edguez in the ninth inning. The pair officially took over for Storen when the latter underwent surgery for a bone chip in his elbow. After allowing four earned runs in seven innings and blowing two saves, Lidge was placed on the disabled list with an abdominal wall strain. He was diagnosed with a sports hernia and underwent surgery on May 1, with an estimated recovery time of three weeks before he could begin throwing again. After pitching a perfect inning in a rehab assignment for the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals, Lidge was able to rejoin the Washington active roster on June 7, a week earlier than expected; he effectively replaced Rodr\u00edguez, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained finger. He was unable to perform with the Nationals, going 0\u20131 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11 bullpen appearances, with opposing hitters batting .308 against him. The Nationals designated Lidge for assignment on June 17 after two poor outings against the New York Yankees, and Ryan Mattheus was activated in his place. He was released from his contract shortly after, and returned home to Colorado in order to spend time with his family and consider whether or not he would pursue another contract.\n\nRetirement \nAfter being released from the Nationals, Lidge took the remainder of the summer to decide whether he wanted to continue his pitching career. On December 2, 2012, he announced his intentions to retire from baseball. At the time of his retirement, Lidge had 225 regular-season career saves, as well as 18 postseason saves. He also struck out 799 batters in  regular-season innings for a career 11.919 K/9, the second-best ratio of any pitcher with more than 500 innings. Lidge signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Phillies on August 1, 2013, enabling him to officially retire as a member of the organization.\n\nPersonal life\nLidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, daughter Avery Grace and son Rowan Thomas. He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies and takes online courses at Regis University. Lidge's cousin, Ryan Lidge, is currently a catcher in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nSee also\n\n Houston Astros award winners and league leaders\n List of Houston Astros no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball career saves leaders\n List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders\n List of Philadelphia Phillies award winners and league leaders\n List of University of Notre Dame athletes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1976 births\nLiving people\nBaseball players from Sacramento, California\nClearwater Threshers players\nCorpus Christi Hooks players\nHouston Astros players\nKissimmee Cobras players\nLakewood BlueClaws players\nLehigh Valley IronPigs players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nNational League All-Stars\nNew Orleans Zephyrs players\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players\nPotomac Nationals players\nPhiladelphia Phillies players\nQuad Cities River Bandits players\nReading Phillies players\nRound Rock Express players\nWashington Nationals players\nWorld Baseball Classic players of the United States\n2006 World Baseball Classic players", "machine_abstract": "Luke Bradford \"Luke\" Bradlidge (born September 16, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Chicago Cubs organization who plays primarily as a starting pitcher and designated hitter .", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Brad Lidge\".

{"id": "D-Shape", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Shape", "title": "D-Shape", "text": "D-Shape is a large 3-dimensional printer that uses binder-jetting, a layer by layer printing process, to bind sand with an inorganic seawater and magnesium-based binder in order to create stone-like objects. Invented by Enrico Dini, founder of Monolite UK Ltd, the first model of the D-Shape printer used epoxy resin, commonly used as an adhesive in the construction of skis, cars, and airplanes, as the binder. Dini patented this model in 2006. After experiencing problems with the epoxy, Dini changed the binder to the current magnesium-based one and patented his printer again in September 2008. In the future, Dini aims to use the printer to create full-scale buildings.\n\nTechnical description\nThe current version of the D-Shape 3-D printer sits in a 6m by 6m aluminum frame. The frame consists of a square base that moves upwards along four vertical beams during the printing process via stepper motors, which are used to repeatedly move a specified length and then hold in place, on each beam. Spanning the entire horizontal 6m of the base is a printer head with 300 nozzles, each spaced 20mm apart. The printer head is connected to the base by an aluminum beam that runs perpendicular to the printer head.\n\nProcess \nBefore the actual printing process can begin, a 3-D model of the object to be printed must be created on CAD, a software that allows a designer to create 3-D models on a computer. Once the model is finished, the CAD file is sent to the printer head. The printing process begins when a layer of sand from 5 to 10\u00a0mm thick, mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO), is evenly distributed by the printer head in the area enclosed by the frame. The printer head breaks the 3-D model into 2-D slices. Then, starting with the bottom slice, the head moves across the base and deposits an inorganic binding liquid made up of a solution that includes magnesium chloride, at a resolution of . The binder and sand chemically react to form a sandstone material. It takes about 24 hours for the material to completely solidify. The material is resembling by composition the Sorel cement.\n\nBecause the nozzles are 20mm apart there are gaps that may need to be filled up. To fill in these gaps and ensure the sand is uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam that holds the printer head forces the printer head to shift in the direction perpendicular to the printer's direction of motion. It takes D-Shape four forward and backward strokes to finish printing a layer. After a layer is finished, the stepper motors on the vertical beams move the base upwards. From the hollow framework just above the printer head, new sand, which is cyclically refilled, is distributed into the area of the frame to create the next layer. During printing, excess sand acts as a support for the solidifying sand and can also be reused in later printings. The printing process is continuous and stops only when the desired structure is completely printed.\n\nAfter the printer finishes its work, the final structure must be extruded from the sand. Workers use shovels to take out the excess sand and reveal the final product. The magnesium oxide mixed in with the sand causes the sand to become an active participant rather than inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost  it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nNYC Waterfront Construction Competition\nIn the fall of 2012, D-Shape entered into the NYC Waterfront Construction Competition hosted by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) in which competitors had to create an innovative solution to help strengthen New York City's deteriorating piers and coastline structures. D-Shape's idea, called, \"Digital Concrete,\" was to take 3-D scans of each piece of pier or infrastructure, and then print a support jacket for each specific piece. D-Shape was the First Place Winner and received $50,000 for the idea, which is estimated to save New York City $2.9 billion.\n\nRadiolaria\nD-Shape successfully created the tallest printed sculpture, Radiolaria, in 2009. Radiolaria, a sculpture created by Italian architect Andrea Morgante and inspired by radiolarians, unicellular organisms with intricate mineral skeletons, shows off D-Shape's ability to print large freeform structures. The current version of the sculpture is only a 3 x 3 x 3m scale model of the full-size Radiolaria that is planned to be put in a roundabout in Pontedera, Italy.\n\nFuture of D-Shape \nCurrently, Jake Wake-Walker and Marc Webb are working on a documentary, titled The Man Who Prints Houses, about Enrico Dini and his invention. Although D-Shape has garnered attention for its printing abilities, it is still a work in progress. While it has gotten close to printing an actual house by printing a trullo, which is a small, stone hut, the printer still needs to be modified in order to make Dini's dreams of printing larger and more complex buildings a reality.\n\nLunar bases\nBecause of D-Shape's capabilities, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken interest in using the printer to build moon bases. The ESA is interested in using D-Shape to build moon bases out of lunar regolith, otherwise known as moon dust, because the 3-D printer can build the base onsite without human intervention. This is advantageous because only the machine would have to be taken to the moon, thus reducing the cost of bringing building materials to the lunar surface to create the bases. D-Shape has been successful in printing components for the lunar bases with a simulated moon dust, and has also been subject to tests that aim to see how the printer will work in the environment on the moon.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Discovery Channel Covering D-Shape https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYaRUVTwIVc \n\n2006 introductions\nConstruction\nBuilding technology", "machine_abstract": "The D-shape is the shape of a molecule that has two double bonds and one single bond between carbon atoms in its molecular formula.\nD-shaped molecules are also known as bent chains, because they have a bend or kink at their center (the location where there would be only one bond if it were not bent).", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"D-Shape\".

If Widjaja has been received  as a sort of pop star, then he\u2019s succeeded on a even higher level in bringing rich musical values to the marketplace than have, say, Nigel Kennedy and David Garrett. His versions of Bach sound like no others. He weds strong timbral individuality to comprehensive technical command and deep musical insight. Urgently recommended! A young violinist, synthesizing much of value from the past with much of value from the present. Intensely interesting\u2014and riveting\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n \n Filmportr\u00e4t von brainworkers & more\n Iskandar Widjaja bei YOUTUBE\n Iskandar Widjaja: Pulling all the Right Strings, Article in the Jakarta Post dated 9 June 2013\n Iskandar Widjaja: K\u00fcnstler nicht in Schubladen stecken\n\nGerman classical violinists\nMale classical violinists\n1986 births\nLiving people\nMusicians from Berlin", "machine_abstract": "Iskandar Widjaja (born September 8, 1953) is the son of Indonesian tycoon Robert Kuok and younger brother to Victor Liem.

{"id": "Ashburn Alley", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashburn%20Alley", "title": "Ashburn Alley", "text": "Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to \"The Yard\" kids area, and features a \"street-fair\" like atmosphere before and during a game.\n\nAshburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.\n\nFeatures\n\nAshburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.\n\nOn the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.\n\nOn top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.\n\nThere are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.\n\nReferences\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nSports in Philadelphia", "machine_abstract": "Ashburn Alley is the name of several streets in London, England and elsewhere named after Sir Henry Ashburn (1753\u20131829), who was Chief Justice of Ireland from 1784 to 1829.\nSir Henry's father Thomas Ashburn had been MP for County Down between 1741\u20131761", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Ashburn Alley\".

{"id": "Third Mind Records", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third%20Mind%20Records", "title": "Third Mind Records", "text": "Third Mind Records was a British independent record label, founded in February 1983 by Gary Levermore.\n\nName\nThe label derived its name from the book The Third Mind, a work compiled by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and artist Brion Gysin using the cut-up technique.\n\nHistory\nThird Mind originated from the group and fanzine Tone Death that Levermore had founded in the middle of 1982 together with two friends. During that time Levermore started contacting bands he had discovered through diverse media and on concerts which would finally be featured in Tone Death. While writing the editorial for the second issue of the fanzine, to be released around February 1983, Levermore \"began considering the possibility of releasing a cassette containing contributions by some of the groups that had been featured in the two issues to date.\" His considerations led to the double cassette release Rising From The Red Sand Vols. I&II which was followed by volumes III and IV in 1983. The compilations featured a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial bands some of which would be later on the label's roster, and sped up Levermore's \"transition from zine enthusiast into label owner.\"\n\nThe Rising From The Red Sand series was met with stronger demands than Levermore had anticipated. Sending promo copies to some shops and getting a five star review in Sounds magazine led to a great number of order requests. The London-based shop of Rough Trade ordered a substantial number of copies. \"Those compilations sold quite well\", remembered Levermore, \"and more or less provided the fund base to actually put out three or four albums.\"\n\nAfter this initial success Third Mind developed slowly, with an annual quantity of seven or eight records in the first years. Levermore had to deal with tight budgets, the label's artists recorded \"for very, very low sums of money.\" Signing Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly and British singer-songwriter Bill Pritchard in 1987 meant a major step forward for the label making them the label's flagships in different markets and entailing also further post-Third Mind management duties.\n\nAll of the label's releases until after Front Line Assembly's 1990 album Caustic Grip were licensed to American independent label Wax Trax.\n\nThird Mind started off with Rough Trade as distributor which changed between 1987 and 1988 when the label switched to Play It Again Sam. Due to \"policy differences\" Third Mind and Play It Again Sam terminated their partnership and in 1992 Levermore moved on to partner with American metal label Roadrunner Records. In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore \"a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases.\" Before Roadrunner, Levermore said, \"there's been many occasions over the years when I've seen a band that I wanted to work with go somewhere else and have a bit of success.\"\n\nLevermore and Roadrunner ended their collaboration in April 1994. When Third Mind ended its business activities in the same year, it had released more than 100 titles. The rights to all releases passed over to Roadrunner.\n\nFourth Dimension Records\nIn 1983 Levermore started Fourth Dimension Records as an offshoot of Third Mind. After two releases he handed over business to Richard Johnson from British fanzine Grim Humour. The second release was born out of collaboration between Levermore and Johnson as flexi disc for Grim Humour. Johnson had already thought about starting a label by himself and \"when Gary told me he wouldn\u2019t be operating FD after this second release, it just made sense for me to continue with the name.\"\n\nArtists\n\nSee also \n List of record labels\n\nReferences\n\nBritish independent record labels\nRecord labels established in 1983\nIndustrial record labels\nElectronic music record labels\nNew wave record labels\nCassette culture 1970s\u20131990s", "machine_abstract": "Third Mind Records is the record label founded by producer and songwriter Paul White in 1998, based out of Los Angeles California.

{"id": "USS Hollister", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%20Hollister", "title": "USS Hollister", "text": "USS Hollister (DD-788) was a  of the United States Navy, named for the three Hollister brothers, who were killed in 1943 while serving in the Navy during World War II.\n\nConstruction and career \nHollister was launched on 9 October 1945 by Todd Shipyard, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Howard J. Hollister, mother of the three Hollister brothers; and commissioned on 29 March 1946, Commander W.\u00a0T. Samuels in command.\n\nService in the United States Navy \nAfter shakedown along the California coast, Hollister departed San Diego, California on 9 November 1946 for operations in the Far East. She arrived Shanghai, on 1 December and later that month assisted the Korean Government in the prevention of smuggling. She continued operations in Far Eastern waters until returning to San Diego on 22 June 1947. For the next 14 months Hollister engaged in training exercises and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast.\n\nHollister departed on 1 September 1948 for her second deployment in the western Pacific where she joined the 7th Fleet on peacekeeping operations. She returned to Long Beach on 24 April 1949 and operated in California waters until July 1950.\n\nKorean War \nImmediately after North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, the United States committed its military might to halting aggression. Hollister was among the first reinforcements rushed to the battle area, departing San Diego on 5 July. Operating with Fast Carrier Task Force 77 (TF\u00a077), she served as a screening ship and performed plane guard duty. In mid-September Hollister engaged in support of the highly successful landing at Inchon.\n\nThe 3d Battalion, 5th Marines landed at 06:33, 15 September. Later that day General Douglas MacArthur praised the performance saying that \"The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\" A week later Hollister took Rear Admiral Ewen (TF-77) for a conference with Commander 7th Fleet. In a message to his command, Admiral Ewen echoed MacArthur in praising its work: \"The performance of Task Force 77 throughout the Inchon operations has added another page to the glorious history of our Navy and its airpower. It has been made possible only through the determination, the relentless effort and the esprit de corps of a team that is really great. Task Force 77 will sail for the high seas soon and will stay at sea until the North Korean Communists have their bellies full ...\" In late September the destroyer was detached for diversionary bombardment in Communist-held areas, effectively weakening enemy positions as American forces smashed north.\n\nIn early November 1950, Hollister sailed with the Formosa Straits patrol, returning to Korea in mid-December for support of the H\u016dngnam evacuation. She continued support operations, anti-junk patrols and shore bombardment before returning to San Diego on 11 April 1951. Hollister operated in the San Diego area until she returned to Korean action a year later. In late April 1955, she resumed duties with Task Force 77, including fire-support missions, patrol, antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and screening duty. Hollister joined the Formosa patrol in August, but resumed operations in Korea before returning to San Diego on 18 November.\n\nThe veteran ship operated out of San Diego until 21 July 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour. Hollister engaged in patrols both off Korea and Formosa to make clear America's objective of protecting her allies. After six months in this area she returned home on 19 February 1954. In September, she was deployed to the Western Pacific at a time when the Chinese Communists were stirring trouble in the South China Sea. During the next three months she engaged in hunter-killer operations off Japan and had patrol duty in the South China Sea. In late January 1955, Hollister accompanied the 7th Fleet in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalists from the Tachen Islands. Constant aerial coverage from this powerful carrier force enabled the Nationalists to move from an untenable position. This was considered by some as \"the most forthright U.S. action against communism since the Korean War.\" She returned to San Diego on 13 March for local operations.\n\nAnother deployment to the Far East from 27 September 1955 to 11 March 1956, saw Hollister resume her important peace keeping operations in this explosive area. Only six months passed before departing on another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, this time visiting Samoa, New Zealand, Manus, and Guam en route to the South China Sea. In January and February 1957, she operated with the Formosa Patrol and conducted training out of Japan before returning to San Diego 24 March.\n\nHollister deployed on 25 October on her ninth Western Pacific tour. In the early months of 1958 she operated with units of the 7th Fleet on Formosa Patrol. Units in this area were placed on alert as a crisis in Indonesia threatened the existing government. The presence of U.S. seapower exerted a powerful influence; the crisis subsided. The destroyer returned to San Diego 23 April but sailed again for the Western Pacific on 18 December to operate with the 7th Fleet. Returning San Diego on 13 June 1959, Hollister spent the remainder of the year engaged in tactical exercises out of San Diego.\n\nHollister departed on 6 February 1960 for her 11th Western Pacific deployment and began patrol duty in the Formosa Straits. This tour of duty also saw her engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises with the Philippine Navy. She returned to San Diego on 14 June to resume training and readiness operations.\n\nHollister entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 March 1961 for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul, remaining there through the end of the year for an addition of a helicopter deck and hangar aft. After refresher training, she departed Long Beach, California on 7 June 1962 for duty with the 7th Fleet. This cruise came after the Laos crisis and Communist insurgency threatened Thailand.\n\nShe remained in the Far East until 21 December 1962 when she returned to Long Beach. During 1963 Hollister engaged in shore bombardment exercises and antisubmarine training off the coast of California and in Hawaii water.\n\nIn the first half of 1964, Hollister engaged in antisubmarine exercises on the American West Coast. On 19 June, she departed Long Beach, California, with an antisubmarine group bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 June. After passage to Japan, she took up a station for contingency operations in the South China Sea on 4 August, and received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her patrol services off Vietnam. After continuing these operations intermittently until 17 November, Hollister began transit from Yokosuka, Japan, to Long Beach on 23 December, arriving on 6 January 1965.\n\nWith three months of overhaul complete, the ship engaged in continuous training exercises from 28 May to 20 August. Deploying again to the western Pacific in August, Hollister was ordered to Taiwan Patrol duty on 14 September.\n\nVietnam War \nBy 22 September, she returned to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, to commence plane guard and anti-submarine screen duties supporting . Hollister accompanied the aircraft carrier on \"Yankee Station\" off Vietnam, giving valuable support to the naval operations exercised in opposing the North Vietnamese Communists.\n\nOn 19 December she left the station and arrived in Yokosuka on 30 December, prior to her departure for the United States the following day.\n\nAfter a six-month repair and training period, Hollister left Long Beach on 25 June for the Far East once again. Arriving on 15 July, she screened carriers and prevented infiltration of supplies to the Viet Cong. Hollister remained in the Far East, where she was on station in May 1967.\n\nAfter completing a Fleet in-depth overhaul in 1972, Hollister again departed Homeport, this time for her eighteenth deployment to the Western Pacific, carrying a new missile configuration. On 10 August 1972 Hollister became the first U.S. Naval Vessel to ever fire a Surface-to-Surface missile in anger. The missile silenced a North Vietnam Radar site. Only a day before, while on a three ship daylight raid on the Quang Yien storage complex, Hollister received at least 250 rounds of hostile fire. The Task unit destroyed a huge ammunition cache with Hollister returning 193 rounds of fire against enemy shore batteries on the heavily fortified island of Hon Me. This was considered the most daring Destroyer operation of the Vietnam War. The target was destroyed and the Task Unit retired without damage or a single casualty.\n\nHollister returned from the Western Pacific for the last time in February 1973. Hollister's record included completing 21 Western Pacific deployments and action in two major conflicts.\n\nIn September 1973 \"Hollister\" was entered into the Reserve Fleet unit Desron 27, NAVSUPACT, Long Beach, California, with four other ships, the USS McKean DD784, USS Higbee DD806, USS DeHaven DD727 and the USS Henderson DD785. She operated as a training vessel for approximately 124 Naval Reservists. She had an active duty crew of approximately 212. During her reserve assignment she maintained high standards of preparedness to meet any assignment to which she was called.\n\nHollister was decommissioned in September 1979. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1979.\n\nOn 3 March 1983, Hollister was transferred to the Republic of China.\n\nService in the Republic of China Navy \nShe was commissioned on 15 November 1984 in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS Shao Yang (DD-929).\n\nOn 1 September 1988, Hui Yang was training in the open sea of Zuoying, and her shells on board the ship jammed. She was advised not enter the Zuoying Naval Base as her jammed shells pose a danger to the dangerous goods but she did moored in the base despite the warning. On the next day, 2 September, there was a non-commissioned officer whom fired her gun by mistake, and the shell directly penetrated the bridge of Shao Yang, killing 2 non-commissioned officers on the spot. The shells finally landed in the storage room of a family member's village. After these two deaths, the weapon commander, gunners and sergeants of the ship were sent to court martial, and an award from Colonel Lei Guangshu was also stripped.\n\nOn 26 December 1990, she underwent the Wu-Chin III modernization.\n\nIn June 2002, the case of leaking secrets by Liu Yuelong on the ship broke out and Liu was later sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nShe was scheduled for decommissioning on 1 June 2004 at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After the ship was decommissioned, she was temporarily berthed at the No. 4 Shipyard of the Qijin Navy Base in Kaohsiung Port to undergo disassembly for usable materials.\n\nIn mid-June 2006, she served as a target ship for the Han Kuang 22 exercise for naval and air force training, and berthed at the Suao Zhongzheng base. After the exercise of Hanguang 22, the ship was towed back to Qijinhai No. 4 Shipyard.\n\nShe was towed out to sea to be sunk as an artificial reef.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n hazegray.org: USS Hollister\n\nGearing-class destroyers of the United States Navy\nShips built in Seattle\n1945 ships\nMaritime incidents in 2006\nWorld War II destroyers of the United States\nCold War destroyers of the United States\nKorean War destroyers of the United States\nVietnam War destroyers of the United States\nUnited States Navy South Dakota-related ships\nChao Yang-class destroyers\nShips sunk as artificial reefs", "machine_abstract": "The U.S. Navy ship USS Hollister (FFG-58) was the lead ship of her class, and is now decommissioned after serving in the United States Navy from 1974 to 1991.\nHollister-class frigates were designed by Lockheed as modified versions of their LST-1 amphibious assault ships that had been built during World War II.

{"id": "Cruising (driving)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruising%20%28driving%29", "title": "Cruising (driving)", "text": "Cruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or \"strip\") is often the focus of cruising. \"Cruise nights\" are evenings during which cars drive slowly. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.\n\nSome ethnic groups identify with lifestyles related to cruising, such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States along U.S. Route 66. Meets, like those at lowrider and auto shows, are popular across the United States and worldwide in large part due to these ethnic communities.\n\nUnited States\n\nHistory\nThere is no clear-cut date when casual driving turned into cruising along a specific route, although it generally began in the years after World War II with youths of Mexican heritage driving lowriders in Southern California towns, and it rapidly became a popular teenage activity.\n\nCruising culture was an evolution of old traditions of strolling down Main Street or around the town square. Although cruising was predominantly boys showing off their cars (ostensibly to meet girls), groups of girls joined in cruising as well. One appeal of cruising was that youths could evade the supervision of parents and family.\n\nDriving slowly down long, straight streets, preferably with many traffic lights to increase opportunities to talk to other cruisers or pedestrians, was only one part of cruising. Cruisers would also gather in parking lots, particularly those of drive-ins. As a Tucson journalist noted, \"Cruisers, like moths and June bugs, eventually congregate around brightly lighted areas.\" Cruisers were also apt to arrange impromptu races with other cruisers.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, some towns established ordinances to prohibit driving through parking lots without stopping and the police issued tickets for loitering and curfew violations. Increasingly, cruisers would travel from wider areas to gather on popular strips, with police viewing these visitors as troublemakers. Reports of clashes between groups of cruisers began to appear in local newspapers.\n\nHowever, cruising continued to remain popular, with wildly painted vans and pickup trucks joining hot rods and muscle cars in the 1970s. In many locales, there was a generally positive relationship with law enforcement. Racing in populated areas was discouraged by police surveillance and traffic, but cruisers engaged in other games such as mooning onlookers, laying rubber when a signal turned green, and \"chinese fire drills\" in which all occupants of a car stopped at a light would get out, run around the car, and jump back in.\n\nThere was some decline in cruising in the 1970s, possibly connected to the rise of gas prices but also due to a growing change in community attitudes toward cruising. The San Francisco Bay Area had a \"cruising summit\" in 1977 for area police to discuss \"our mutual problems with cruising\". The gathering numbers of vehicles and increases in tensions and violence led many communities to begin looking for ways to discourage cruising, despite many adults retaining a permissive acceptance of cruising with nostalgia for their own cruising days. Although business merchants and shoppers had been inconvenienced for years by cruisers, tolerance had dissipated and law enforcement was encouraged to step in.\n\nDuring the summer of 1974, Los Angeles police began cracking down on cruising, first by banning parking along Van Nuys Boulevard and then in August making it a one-way street. The following summer, as many as 15,000 youths from as far away as San Diego converged on Van Nuys, encouraged by local disc jockeys. A similar crackdown on Whittier Boulevard led to the formation of a cruiser's rights group. Police barricaded portions of Whittier in an attempt to disrupt cruising, but even local adults objected to this practice. Other measures were tried, such as shutting portions of Whittier down completely at night. Cruisers moved to Highland Avenue, resulting in the arrest of 170 during the second weekend of September 1979. The following summer, a section of Van Nuys was closed after 9 p.m. The rationale for the blockade was that it only required fifteen police to close the road, but they would need at least 150 officers to police the 15,000 cruisers who had gathered there. \n\nAs quickly as one strip became unusable, cruisers would find new sites. It became a persistent battle between authorities and cruisers. In 1982, the California state legislature passed a law that gave cities express sanction to shut down streets being used for cruising, when driving \"for purposes of socializing and assembling interferes with the conduct of businesses, wastes precious energy resources, impedes the progress of general traffic and emergency vehicles, and promotes the generation of local concentrations of air pollution and undesirable noise levels\".\n\nEfforts to stop cruising continued, with increasing blockades and mass arrests. In 1985, random checkpoints began to appear, with police stopping cars passing the spot more than once in a given timeframe. Computers were added in 1988 to help track the cars. New curfews for minors were established. Cruising in southern California was generally suppressed by 1990. Other regions used tactics similar to southern California's, with similar mixed results. Police in Galveston, Texas began arresting cruisers, but had to back down in the face of parental complaints. Joplin, Missouri attempted a ban on cruising, but had to repeal it. Merchants in Portland, Oregon complained that they were losing business because of the crackdowns. Multiple towns across the U.S. adopted the checkpoint system.\n\nOther towns tried creative alternatives, such as Laurel, Mississippi and Princeton, West Virginia, which both channeled cruisers onto routes that would not interfere with local businesses. Setting aside parking lots specifically for cruisers was tried in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Indiana. The town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia chose to embrace cruising, awarding prizes for the best customized vehicles.\n\nCities continue to struggle with the problems of cruising into the 2000s. In 2006, Milwaukee, Wisconsin even explored letting police confiscate cruisers' cars. \n\nWhile communities try to prevent impromptu cruising, multiple towns have embraced organized cruising revivals. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000\u00a0muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles. Waukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called \"Scoopin' Genesee\". and Modesto, California celebrates \"Graffiti Summer\" with an annual cruise parade. Renton, Washington hosts \"Cruz the Loop\" each summer, and in 2020 erected a sculpture to honor cruising the loop.\n\nWell-known strips\nOne of the oldest cruising strips in East Los Angeles is located on Whittier Boulevard. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.  Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd. depicted the cruising culture on the strip. In the late 1970s, the Wednesday night cruise on Van Nuys attracted up to 40,000 cars. Sunset Boulevard was another popular cruise strip.\n\nPerhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California.  The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film American Graffiti. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual \"Graffiti Summer\" celebration in the film's honor.\n\nCruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from Car and Driver, Motor Trend, and CBS World News Roundup. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US\u00a024 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nDescription\nThere are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.  The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise \u2013 often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.\n\nMeets\nA meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.\n\nOne-off cruises\nA one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.  The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.\n\nOne-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.  This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.\n\nSome large cruises operate a \"convoy-only\" policy.\n\nLocations\nCruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.\n\nCruising and the law \n\nAlthough cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it, and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents, and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.\n\nAs a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.  This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.\n\nMany city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.\n\nMagazines \n\nCruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline.  In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene \u2013 preferring to concentrate on \"dream\" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.\n\nSee also \n Car customizing\n Hot rod\n Cal-Style VW\n Import scene\n Street racing\n Back to the Bricks\n\nSweden \n Raggare\n\nUK and Republic of Ireland \n Boy racer\n Chav\n Supercar Season\n Scanger\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\nAutomotive events\nDriving\nKustom Kulture\nTransport culture", "machine_abstract": "The following is the list of highways in Croatia by type and length.\nHighways are divided into national, regional or local roads depending on their importance to traffic flow within country borders as well as between countries.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Cruising (driving)\".

{"id": "Fairwater, Cardiff", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairwater%2C%20Cardiff", "title": "Fairwater, Cardiff", "text": "Fairwater () is a district and community in the west of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is located a few miles from Culverhouse Cross which connects Cardiff to the M4 motorway. The population taken at the 2011 census was 12,981.\n\nHistory \n\nThe name Tyllgoed, meaning \"dark wood\" goes back to the 15th century. This leafy district is divided between the mainly privately owned 1930s semi-detached housing developments at the southern end, and more 1950s public housing stock towards the northern end closer to neighbouring Pentrebane. It includes Fairwater Park (known locally as \"the Dell\"), Fairwater Leisure Centre, a skatepark and numerous playing fields.\n\nFairwater is the historic name of one of the canons' stalls at nearby Llandaff Cathedral.\n\nAmenities\n\nFairwater has two secondary schools. The larger of the two, with over a thousand pupils, is the Welsh-medium Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr. The other is Cantonian High School, which has nearly 700 pupils. The building in which Plasmawr stands was originally opened in 1959 as Waterhall Secondary Modern School. Pupils at the school included Martyn Woodroffe an Olympic swimming Silver Medalist in 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. It is on the grounds of old Cantonian lower school, but in recent times has had many new developments built on the site. Peter Lea Primary and Fairwater Primary schools are in the area. Cantonian has produced several Welsh international football (soccer) players. In recent times Ryan Green (once Wales' youngest international), Jermaine Easter and Joe Ledley and, a little further back, John Toshack. Famous former pupils also include the model and Gary Lineker's wife Danielle Bux and director of the film Human Traffic, Justin Kerrigan.\n\nFairwater Brook was a childhood haunt of Roald Dahl, who lived in Radyr and studied in nearby Llandaff.\n\nFairwater Park, known locally as \"The Dell\" is the site of one of Britain's first artificial ski slopes, built in 1969.\n\nFairwater Green is a local area of shops, supposedly named for the area of grass nearby. \n\nFairwater Library opened in 1960, is a small branch library with a small book collection, public access computers and study space is open five days a week.\n\nElectoral ward\nFairwater is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff.  There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Fairwater falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff West.  It is bounded by Creigiau & St. Fagans to the west; Llandaff to the east; Canton to the southeast; Ely to the south; and Radyr to the north. Previously represented by the Labour Party it has since May 2008 been represented on Cardiff Council by Plaid Cymru councillors.\n\nTransport\nFairwater is well served by public transport with three railway stations - Fairwater in the heart of the area, Danescourt in the north and Waun-Gron Park in the south. All 3 stations are on the Cardiff City Line with services northbound to Radyr and southbound to Cardiff Central via Ninian Park. \n\nFairwater has bus services provided by Cardiff Bus operating bus service 61 through the area to Pentrebane, while route 64 runs through to Heath Hospital and route 66 serves Keyston Road. Easyway run an infrequest bus service through Fairwater to St Fagans. \n\nThe main road running through the east of the area is Western Avenue (A48) linking it to Ely Bridge, Ely, Canton and the city centre to the south and Gabalfa, eastern districts and the M4 J30 Cardiff East to the north. St Fagans Road is a country road leading west out of Fairwater to St. Fagans, Ely, Culverhouse Cross and M4 J33 Cardiff West\n\nNotable people from Fairwater\n John Toshack football player, former Welsh football manager, attended Cantonian High School.\n Patti Flynn jazz singer, author and founder of Black History Wales lived in Fairwater in later life.\n Terry Holmes Wales and British Lions international rugby union player\n Joe Ledley Wales football (soccer) international, who attended Cantonian High School.\n Martyn Woodroffe Olympic swimming silver medalist at the Mexico 1968 Summer Olympics\n Justin Kerrigan, Welsh film maker who wrote and directed Human Traffic, attended Cantonian High School.\n Neil McEvoy Political Party Leader, founding father of Wales' Propel Party.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nwww.geograph.co.uk : photos of Fairwater and surrounding area\n\nCommunities in Cardiff", "machine_abstract": "The Fairwater area of the city is located in south-east Wales and includes parts of Cathays, Grangetown, Roath Park, St Mary's Primary School (Cathays), The University Hospital of Wales, Taff Vale Railway Station, and the former site of Fairwater Prison.\nFairwater was originally part of the parish of Llandaff Cathedral but became independent when it gained its own church in 1730.

The novel is the third book in a four book mystery-adventure series set in Edwardian England. The first book in the series was The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow which was Waterstones Children's Book of the Month in June 2015.\n\nPlot\nSophie Taylor and Lillian \"Lil\" Rose, the main female protagonists, are quite bored from lack of mysteries to solve and the business of everyday life in Sinclair's. An art exhibition of some of the finest and most renowned work in the country is to be displayed in Sinclair's and one of the focal pieces is the Green Dragon by Benedetto Casselli, the second artwork in the Casselli sequence, a painting which was especially presented to the exhibition by His Majesty the King Edward VII. On the first day of the exhibition, the cloth supposedly covering the Green Dragon is removed and everyone is shocked to see that the original painting has been stolen and the copy painting of an art student at the Spencer Institute for Art, Leonora \"Leo\" Fitzgerald is replaced. Leo is present and insists that she didn't do it, as she disposed of her artwork after a rich art benefactor Mr Raymond Lyle criticised it, saying it did not resemble the original painting whatsoever despite its imaginative flair demonstrated in the artwork. Investigation by Detective Inspector Worth is held and he recruits Billy as his assistant in interviews, to which Billy is quite proud of. Sophie, Lil, Billy and Joe decide to investigate further and help Leo to discover the truth. They have perilous encounters, make risky decisions and face many obstacles. Will they find out who stole the painting, before it is too late?\n\nCharacters\n -The main female protagonist, along with Lillian Rose. She was left penniless by her father, who died, after a failure to include her in his will. She went to work in the Millinery Department in Sinclair's Department Store, helping people choose and fit hats. She was bullied by her colleagues after turning up to training on her first day wearing her best clothes, instead of plain blouse and skirt. She quickly made friends in Billy Parker and Lillian Rose. She is quite cautious as she fears she is being hunted down by the Baron, as she has seen him and recognises his identity, which poses a threat to the Baron of being exposed to the police. She is a smart, kind girl who has wits and charm about her. She is described as mousy and short.\n -The main female protagonist, along with Sophie Taylor. She comes from a wealthy background and her parents despised her ambitions to become an actress, wishing her to become a debutante in high society. She pursues her dreams carefully. She works as a chorus girl in several productions, mainly \"The Shop Girl\" and she also played Arabella in \"The Inheritance\". Besides her theatrical work, she is a \"Captain's Girl\" (a manikin for the latest fashions). She is described as being tall, dark and being wonderfully beautiful.\n -The secondary female protagonist. She comes from an aristocratic background and her family is well-known. Her parents refused to let her go to art school, but eventually gave in after persuasion of Lady Tremayne, Leo's godmother. Leo's family home is Winter Hall. She goes to the Spencer Institute of Art in London and she is described by many people as a brilliantly talented artist who needs to rise up in confidence. Mr Raymond Lyle, an art benefactor, requested her to make a copy of Benedetto Casselli's Green Dragon. When the Green Dragon is stolen, Leo's copy is left in its place, which arouses suspicion on Leo as the thief of Casselli's Green Dragon. It is up to her and her new-found friends to find it in time...\n\nReferences\n\n2017 British novels\n2017 children's books", "machine_abstract": "The film is set in China during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).

Without any strict method or criticism, he expressed preference for the art of the 15th century. He contributed greatly towards recovery of the neglected art of the Middle Ages.\n\nLife\nRio was born in Island of Arz, Morbihan, Bretagne.\n\nHe was educated at the college of Vannes, where he received his first appointment as instructor, which occupation however proved to be distasteful. He proceeded to Paris, but was temporarily disappointed in his hope of obtaining there a chair of history.\n\nHis enthusiastic championship of the liberty of the Greeks attracted the attention of the Government, which appointed him censor of the public press. His refusal of this appointment won him great popularity and the lifelong friendship of Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert. In 1828 he published his first work, \"Essai sur l'histoire de l'esprit humain dans l'antiquit\u00e9\", which brought him the favour of the minister Auguste de La Ferronays and a secretariate in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This position allowed him (as Montalembert later wrote to him) to become for Christian, what Winckelmann had been for ancient, art.\n\nHe spent the greater portion of the period 1830-60 in travels through Italy, Germany, and England. In Munich he became acquainted with the spokesmen of contemporary Catholicism - Sulpiz Boisser\u00e9e, Franz Xaver Baader, Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Karl Friedrich von Rumohr - and also with Friedrich Schelling. Schelling gave him an insight into the aesthetic ideal; Rumohr directed him to Italy, where the realization of this ideal in art could be seen.\n\nAfter contact with the Pre-Raphaelites of England, where he lived for three years and married, and especially of Montalembert's encouragement, he visited again, in company with his wife, all the important galleries of Europe, although he had meanwhile become lame and had to drag himself through the museums on crutches.\n\nWorks\n\nIn 1835 the first volume of his Art chr\u00e9tien appeared under the misleading title, De la po\u00e9sie chr\u00e9tienne - Forme de l'art. This work, which was received with enthusiasm in Germany and Italy, was a complete failure in France. Discouraged, he renounced art study and wrote a history of the persecutions of the English Catholics, a work which was never printed.\n\nProminent men like Gladstone, Manzoni, and Thiers became interested in his studies, which he published in four volumes under the title \"L'art chr\u00e9tien\" (1861-7). This work is not a history of all Christian art, but of Italian painting from Cimabue to the death of Raphael.\n\nRio describes the more notable incidents of his life in the two works, Histoire d'un coll\u00e8ge Breton sous l'Empire, la petite chouannerie (1842) and Epilogue \u00e0 l'art chr\u00e9tien (2 vols., 1872). He also published the following works: Shakespeare (1864), in which he claims the dramatist as a Catholic; Michel-Ange et Raphael (1867); L'id\u00e9al antique et l'id\u00e9al chr\u00e9tien (1873).\n\nReferences\n\nLef\u00e9bure, Portraits de croyants (2nd ed., Paris, 1905), 157-284.\n\nExternal links\nCatholic Encyclopedia article\narthistorians.info page \n\n1797 births\n1874 deaths\nPeople from Morbihan\nFrench art historians\nFrench male non-fiction writers", "machine_abstract": "Alexis Fran\u00e7ois Rio (17 September 1753 \u2013 29 May 1828) was a French painter, sculptor and engraver of the 18th century who specialized in portraits.

{"id": "Albert Schultens", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert%20Schultens", "title": "Albert Schultens", "text": "Albert Schultens (; 22 August 168626 January 1750) was a Dutch philologist.\n\nBiography\nHe was born at Groningen, where he studied for the church. He went on to the University of Leiden, applying himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His thesis Dissertatio theologico-philologica de utilitate linguae Arabicae in interpretenda sacra lingua (\"The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture\") appeared in 1706. After a visit to Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his degree in theology (1709), he returned to Leiden, and devoted himself to the study of the manuscript collections there until 1711, when he became pastor at Wassenaer.\n\nHe disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the collegium theologicum, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden.\n\nSchultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens' treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine. Schultens vindicated the value of comparative study of the Semitic tongues against those who, like Jacques Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do.\n\nHis principal works were Institutiones ad Fundumenta Lingu\u00e6 Hebraic\u00e6 (1737), Origines Hebraeae (2 vols., 1724, 1738), a second edition of which, with the De defectibus linguae Hebraeae (1731), appeared in 1761; Job (1737); Proverbs (1748); Vetus et regia via hebraezandi (1738); and Monumenta vetustiora Arabum (1740). He left unfinished Institutiones Aram\u00e6\u00e6 (1745\u201349).\n\nReferences \n \n\n1686 births\n1750 deaths\nDutch Arabists\nDutch orientalists\nDutch philologists\n17th-century philologists\nLinguists from the Netherlands\nPeople from Groningen (city)\nLeiden University alumni\nUniversity of Franeker faculty\nLeiden University faculty", "machine_abstract": "Schulten, Albert (Albertus) (born 29 May 1898 in Utrecht \u2013 died 16 September 1977) was a Dutch historian and archaeologist who specialized on the Roman Republic period of ancient Rome.\nHe studied at Leiden University where he received his doctorate under Jacob Cornelis van Oorschot's supervision in 1927.

He was appointed as reader in Aligarh Muslim University, later becoming professor of Urdu Language and then honorary consultant of the department. \n\nKhan journeyed to acquaint himself with the centres of Islamic importance in India, where he met Sheikh ul-Hadith Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi (1898\u20131982) and the reformer Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi, from whom he learned dawah and reformation.\n\nSoon after, he attended Lucknow University and earned a PhD.\n\nWork \nKhan is a prolific writer in Urdu.  Perhaps his best-known work is A history in Urdu Journalism (1822\u20131857) (1991), which examines newspapers from nine different cities.\n\nHis works are part of the syllabi in various universities, and several have been translated into English.  His wide-ranging study of Urdu journalistic literature is a contribution of abiding value to the appreciation of India ethos at a crucial moment in Indian history.  His extensive study of contemporary Urdu literature, his rare insight into the process of social change and, above all, his unique faculty of analysis and interpretation are each reflected in his study which opens fresh vistas for the interpretation of socio-political history of modern India.  Lately the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has studied the culture of the small French village Montaillou on the basis of Jacques Fouiern's Register's.  His work is rightly claimed as constituting a landmark in modern historiography.  No such work has so far been undertaken in India.  The newspapers from Mirzapur, Benaras, Meerut, Bareilly, Rampur, etc., brought to light by Khan, will hopefully one day attract scholars to undertake similar studies of the intellectual and social milieu of the Indian towns.  He prepared grounds for the utilization of journalistic literature for the reconstruction of the cultural history of India during the 19th century.\n\nDue to his sermons and simple and modest lifestyle, Dr Nadir Ali Khan commands respect from Muslims all over the world.

Ferritin, a routine investigation for anemia, is an acute-phase reactant, and may be elevated in states of inflammation, thereby falsely indicating that iron stores are adequate. Because sTfR is insensitive to inflammation, it can detect anemia in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, and is particularly useful in distinguishing between the anemia of chronic disease and anemias caused by lack of iron intake.\n\nTo date, the conventionally identified soluble transferrin receptor has not been itself implicated in intracellular delivery of transferrin and associated iron stores.\n\nA soluble receptor for any ligand could also refer to a molecule present is solution (for example a secretory protein) which would bind with the target ligand and then  effect cellular delivery. In this context the multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been reported as a soluble receptor for transferrin.

{"id": "Chicago City Railway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago%20City%20Railway", "title": "Chicago City Railway", "text": "The Chicago City Railway Company (CCRy) was an urban  transit company that operated horse, cable, and electric streetcars on Chicago's South Side between 1859 and 1914, when it became merged into and part of the Chicago Surface Lines (CSL) metropolitan-wide system. After that time it owned electric streetcars, along with gasoline, diesel, and propane \u2013 fueled transit busses. Purchased by the government agency  Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in 1947, it was liquidated in 1950.\n\nBeginnings (C.C.Ry.)\nIn the 1850s,  Chicago was growing and better public transportation was needed. Horse drawn omnibuses were shuttling passengers between several recently built interstate railroad stations for radiating lines like spokes of a wheel by 1853, but city/town  streets, roads and turnpikes were often muddy, rutted and potholed with travel  very difficult. In 1858, omnibus operator Frank Parmelee and a group of investors were awarded a city franchise for a rail horsecar line, but legal challenges caused them to seek a state charter instead. On February 14, 1859, the Chicago City Railway Company (C.C.Ry.) was incorporated and in two months horsecars were running on State Street between Randolph and 12th Streets.\n\nHorsecars \nThe horsecars were a success from the start. The smooth rail and reduced rolling resistance allowed larger cars to be used in all weather. A typical car was  long,  wide, and could carry 20 passengers.\n\nAlthough horsecar lines were inexpensive to build, they were expensive to operate. Horses could be up to  of the value of a company. They were expensive to buy, needed people to maintain them, were subject to illness, and made a huge amount of manure/waste. By 1880, the C.C.Ry. was looking for a better, mechanical replacement.\n\nCable cars \nIn 1880, superintendent Charles Holmes visited San Francisco to see the new and successful cable car lines there, and could see a use for cable cars in Chicago. As with most cities which would use cable cars, the problem in flat-landed Chicago was not one of grades and steep hills and valleys, but of pure transportation capacity.\n\nConstruction began in 1881 on a system designed by William Eppelsheimer, with lines going south from the downtown area on main thoroughfare State Street and Wabash-Cottage Grove Avenues. This system was to become the largest and most profitable cable car system in the world.\n\nState Street service started on January 28, 1882, Cottage Grove Avenue on February 26. Counter to some people's expectations, the cable cars did not suffer much from the elements, and the harsher Chicago climate with extreme variations in summer heat and winter cold was no problem for them.\n\nThe number of passengers caused a different approach to the cars than the San Francisco cable car system. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like the \"California Cars\", CCRy used short bi-directional grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.\n\nThe cable cars did not completely replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to trolleys, the electrical cars from some feeder lines had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown area, due to the lack of trolley wires there.\n\nElectric streetcars \n\nAs the cable system was being built electric traction was being developed. Although the individual cars cost more, stringing wire cost far less per mile than digging conduits. In 1892, the Chicago City Council allowed C.C.Ry.'s first electric lines. Since the cable lines were already effective, and there was opposition to wires downtown, electric cars were used to replace horsecars on feeder routes when they became available. It was not until 1906, that all CCRy lines were converted to electricity. From then on, the CCRy primarily operated electric streetcars.\n\nChicago Surface Lines (C.S.L.) \nBy 1900, political corruption, unscrupulous actions by other companies, and public opinion made it difficult for the street railways to plan ahead. Length and terms of franchises, fare caps, taxes, and property owner consent were some of the problems.\n\nPublic ownership was discussed, but instead, city ordinances controlling the private companies were passed and appealed for years. One was the Unification Ordinance of November 13, 1913 by the Chicago City Council, which combined management and operations of all Chicago streetcar companies as the Chicago Surface Lines  (C.S.L.), taking effect in 1914. The C.C.Ry. became a \"paper company\". It continued to own equipment, but the equipment was operated by the C.S.L. and used systemwide throughout the metropolitan area.\n\nThe CSL was eventually sold to the publicly owned, government agency, Chicago Transit Authority after 88 years of private operations and 34 years since consolidation, on April 22, 1947, and the CCRy was liquidated on February 15, 1950.\n\nRemnants \nIn 2015  yard switcher CSL #L202 and flat car CTA #314 are at the Fox River Trolley Museum in South Elgin, Illinois. CCRy #209 cable trailer and CSL #9020 electric trailer are at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. Horsecar #10 and grip car #532 were on exhibit in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry in 1979.\n\nOne CCRy streetcar station from 1893 survives at 5529 South Lake Park Avenue in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. The former cable car station and waiting room currently serves as the home of the Hyde Park Historical Society.\n\nA shop building from 1902 and streetcar barns from 1906, still  remain in service by 2014 at the CTA's 77th Street and Vincennes Avenue yards. Another streetcar barn remains on Wabash Avenue just north of 63rd Street.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n </ref>\n\nExternal links\nHyde Park Historical Society\nForgotten Chicago\nPublic Transportation at Encyclopedia of Chicago\nStreet Railways at Encyclopedia of Chicago\n\nRailway lines in Chicago\nDefunct Illinois railroads\nCable car railways in the United States\n1859 establishments in Illinois\n1950 disestablishments in Illinois", "machine_abstract": "The Chicago City Railway (CCR) was the first electric streetcar system in North America, and one of the earliest such systems anywhere in the world.

Under the Lanteen Laboratories brand, Riddlesbarger operated a chain of clinics in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan, which were promoted through radio advertising. \n\nRiddlesbarger is believed to have been an Army Air Corps pilot during World War I.  He later worked for the U.S. Post Office, flying air mail starting in 1920, but was grounded in 1921 for failing to promptly report a forced landing, resulting in delay to the mail. Riddlesbarger invented a diaphragm that was successfully marketed through his firm, Lanteen Laboratories, using storefront clinics called \"Medical Bureaus of Birth Control Information\" and a variety of media, including radio, direct mailings to doctors, and in packages of sanitary napkins. One of Riddlesbarger's clinic operators, Adele Gordon, was, with her husband John, unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1935 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for selling birth control devices. Lanteen Laboratories had been organized in 1928, with 90% of its stock owned by Riddlesbarger. Lanteen sold a comprehensive line of products, including contraceptive jellies, douches, tampons and suppositories. \n\nThe proceeds from Riddlesbarger's venture went to purchase a ranch in southern Arizona which he named Lanteen Ranch, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kinjockity Ranch. Riddlesbarger commissioned Phoenix architect Edward C. Morgan to design the Pueblo Revival house and guest house, and the interior was decorated by designer and sculptor  Raymond Phillips Sanderson. Riddlesbarger, through the Lanteen Arabian Foundation, bred Arabian horses at the ranch, most notably owning Antez, a famous sire originally owned by Will Keith Kellogg. Antez sired Palominos while with Riddlesbarger. Bamboo Harvester, who played Mister Ed in the eponymous television show, was a grandson of Antez. \n\nAlthough he intended to live at the ranch full-time, Riddlesbarger sold the ranch in 1946 and moved to Tucson. He had lost a substantial judgment in tax court over Lanteen's purchase of the ranch lands and subsequent payment of the ranch to him as a dividend. He was unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1948 for statutory rape for an alleged affair with a house servant,  and left the United States shortly thereafter. A final divorce decree was granted in favor of his former wife Fay Riddlesbarger in 1948,  following proceedings that began in 1931,  and allegations of coercion,  but further proceedings continued into 1952, reaching the Illinois Supreme Court.  Rufus had two daughters with Fay. Legal proceedings in the 1950s indicate that Rufus settled in east Africa in what was then Tanganyika.\n\nReferences\n\n20th-century American inventors\n1890s births\nYear of death missing", "machine_abstract": "Rufus Riddlesberger (born September 16, 1943) is the former mayor of Santa Clara, California and current member of the Santa Clara City Council representing District 1 since 2005.

{"id": "Hollow fiber bioreactor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow%20fiber%20bioreactor", "title": "Hollow fiber bioreactor", "text": "A Hollow fiber bioreactor is a 3 dimensional cell culturing system based on hollow fibers, which are small, semi-permeable capillary membranes arranged in parallel array with a typical molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) range of 10-30 kDa. These hollow fiber membranes are often bundled and housed within tubular polycarbonate shells to create hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges. Within the cartridges, which are also fitted with inlet and outlet ports, are two compartments: the intracapillary (IC) space within the hollow fibers, and the extracapillary (EC) space surrounding the hollow fibers.\n\nCells are seeded into the EC space of the hollow fiber bioreactor and expand there. Cell culture medium is pumped through the IC space and delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells via hollow fiber membrane perfusion. As the cells expand, their waste products and CO2 also perfuse the hollow fiber membranes and are carried away by the pumping of medium through the IC space. As waste products build up due to increased cell mass, the rate of medium flow can also be increased so that cell growth is not inhibited by waste product toxicity.\n\nBecause thousands of hollow fibers may be packed into a single hollow fiber bioreactor, they increase the surface area of the cartridge considerably. As a result, cells can fill up the EC space to densities >108 cells/ml. However, the cartridge itself takes up a very small volume (oftentimes the volume of a 12-oz soda can). The fact that hollow fiber bioreactors are very small and yet enable incredibly high cell densities has led to their development for both research and commercial applications, including monoclonal antibody and influenza vaccine production. Likewise, because hollow fiber bioreactors use up significantly less medium and growth factors than traditional cell culture methods such as stirred-tank bioreactors, they offer a significant cost savings. Finally, hollow fiber bioreactors are sold as single-use disposables, resulting in significant time savings for laboratory staff and technicians.\n\nHistory \nIn 1972, the Richard Knazek group at the NIH reported how mouse fibroblasts cultured on 1.5\u00a0cm3 hollow fiber capillary membranes composed of cellulose acetate were able to form 1\u00a0mm-wide nodules in 28 days. The group recorded the final cell number as approximately 1.7 x 107 cells from a starter batch of only 200,000 cells. When the same group cultured human choriocarcinoma cells on polymeric and silicone polycarbonate capillary membranes totaling less than 3\u00a0cm3 in volume, the cells expanded to an amount approximating 2.17 x 108 cells.\n\nThe Knazek group was awarded the patent for hollow fiber bioreactor technology in 1974. Based on this patented technology, companies began building different and larger (commercial) scale hollow fiber bioreactors, with significant development and technological improvement occurring in the late 1980s to early 1990s. By 1990, at least three companies were reported to offer commercially available hollow fiber bioreactors.\n\nOne engineering advance included adding a gas exchange cartridge, which enabled better control of system's pH and oxygen levels. Similar to a mammalian lung, the gas exchange cartridge efficiently oxygenated the culture medium, allowing the bioreactor to support higher numbers of cells. Combined with the ability to add or remove CO2 for precise pH control, the limitations commonly associated with large-scale cell culture were eliminated, resulting in densely packed cell cultures that could be maintained for several months.\n\nIn addition, control of the fluid dynamics within each hollow fiber bioreactor led to further optimization of the cell culture environment. By alternating the pressure gradient across the hollow fiber membrane, media could flow back and forth between the EC side (cell compartment) and the IC side (hollow fiber lumen). This process, combined with the axial media flow created when media passes down the length of the fibers, optimized the growth environment throughout the entire bioreactor.\n\nThis concept is termed EC cycling, and was developed as a solution to the gradients that form within hollow fiber bioreactors when media is pushed down the length of their fibers. Higher hydrostatic pressure at the axial end (media entering the fiber lumen) compared to the distal end of the bioreactor creates a Starling flow in the EC space, which is similar to what is observed in the body. This phenomenon also creates a nutrient-rich axial region and a nutrient-depleted distal region within the bioreactor. By incorporating EC cycling, the effects of Starling flow are eliminated and the entire bioreactor becomes nutrient-rich and optimized for cell growth.\n\nOptimal IC and EC space perfusion rates must be achieved in order to efficiently deliver media nutrients and growth supplements, respectively, and to collect supernatant. During the cell growth phase within these bioreactors, the media feed rate is increased to accommodate the expanding cell population. More specifically, the IC media perfusion rate is increased to provide additional glucose and oxygen to the cells while continually removing metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. When the cell space is completely filled with cells, the media feed rate plateaus, resulting in constant glucose consumption, oxygen uptake and lactate production rates.\n\nApplications \nWith the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, cell culture could be applied towards the generation of secreted proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and even some categories of vaccines. In order to produce these proteins on a commercial scale, new methods for culturing large batches of cells had to be developed. One such technological development was the hollow fiber bioreactor.\n\nHollow fiber bioreactors are used to generate high concentrations of cell-derived products including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, growth factors, viruses and virus-like particles. This is possible because the semi-permeable hollow fiber membranes allow for the passage of low molecular weight nutrients and wastes from the cell-containing EC into the non-cell-containing IC space, but they do not allow the passage of larger products such as antibodies. Therefore, as a cell line (e.g., hybridoma) expands and expresses a target protein, that protein remains within the EC space and is not flushed out. At a given time point (or continually during the culture), the harvest supernatant (product) is collected, clarified and refrigerated for a future downstream application.\n\nSmaller hollow fiber bioreactors are often used for selection and optimization of cell lines prior to stepping up to larger cell culturing systems. Doing so saves on growth factor costs because a significant portion of the cell culture media does not require the addition of expensive components like fetal bovine serum. Likewise, the smaller hollow fiber bioreactors can be housed in a laboratory incubator just like cell culture plates and flasks.\n   \nRecently, hollow fiber bioreactors have been tested as novel platforms for the commercial production of high-titer influenza A virus. In this study, both adherent and suspension Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cells (MDCK) were infected with two different strains of influenza: A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and the pandemic strain A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1).

{"id": "Lorraine 37L", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine%2037L", "title": "Lorraine 37L", "text": "The Lorraine 37L or , (\"tank supply tractor 1937 L\") is a light tracked armoured vehicle developed by the Lorraine company during the interwar period or interbellum, before the Second World War, to an April 1936 French Army requirement for a fully armoured munition and fuel supply carrier to be used by tank units for front line resupply. A prototype was built in 1937 and production started in 1939. In this period, two armoured personnel carriers and a tank destroyer project were also based on its chassis. Mainly equipping the larger mechanised units of the French Infantry arm, the type was extensively employed during the Battle of France in 1940. After the defeat of France, clandestine manufacture was continued in Vichy France, culminating in a small AFV production after the liberation and bringing the total production to about 630 in 1945. Germany used captured vehicles in their original role of carrier and later, finding the suspension system to be particularly reliable, rebuilt many into tank destroyers () of the Marder I type or into self-propelled artillery.\n\nDevelopment\nIn 1934, the order was given to design a munition supply vehicle to increase the operational range of independent tank units. The same year, the Renault 36R was selected for further development; three hundred were ordered from 1938. However, this tractor was only partially armoured; on 17 April 1936, a new set of specifications was drafted for a fully armoured vehicle to deliver fuel and munitions to tanks fighting on the frontline.\n\nEarly in 1937, the  company finished a prototype. It was a lengthened version of a proposed replacement type for the 1931 model Renault UE Chenillette tracked infantry supply tractor. In February 1937, the mat\u00e9riel commission, the , was ordered to test the prototype and to complete an evaluation before 1 November 1937, even if testing had not been finished. The prototype was only presented on 9 July and tested until 4 August. It was equipped with a 2371 cc Delahaye four cylinder 124 F engine. Although the vehicle attained a maximum speed of , this dropped to an unacceptably low  when an intended fuel trailer was attached. It was therefore returned to the factory and a more powerful Delahaye 135 engine and stronger clutch were fitted. This vehicle was tested between 22 September and 29 October and achieved the desired .\n\nProduction\nThe commission approved the type during late 1937, being especially impressed by the rugged suspension system. It was decided in September 1939 to reserve the total production capacity of the suspension elements for the larger tractor. This implied that the shorter Lorraine replacement for the Renault UE, though also favoured over other candidates, would not be taken into production: an order of hundred made early 1939 was that month shifted towards the longer version.\n\nIn 1938, three orders were made: of 78, 100 and another 100 vehicles of the  (TRC 37L); in 1939, before the war, a fourth order of 100 followed, and then a fifth of 74, to which was added the replacement order of 100 for a total of 552. The first vehicle was delivered by Lorraine on 11 January 1939; 212 had been delivered on 1 September 1939.\n\nThe ambitious plans made after the outbreak of war for the expansion of the number of armoured divisions meant that the Lorraine 37L orders had to be enlarged accordingly, bringing the total to 1012. The intended initial production rate was fifty per month, to be expanded to seventy. To assist in the manufacture, a second assembly hall was erected by Fouga at B\u00e9ziers, where it was hoped that it could produce at first twenty and later thirty vehicles per month. In reality, this number was never attained; e.g. 20 were made in January, 32 by both companies in May 1940. On 26 May 1940, 432 vehicles had been delivered to the army by Lorraine and Fouga out of 440 produced. Production continued after that date and an estimated total of about 480 to 490 had been reached by 25 June 1940, the end of the Battle of France.\n\nDescription\nBeing derived from a  project, the Lorraine 37 L was a rather small vehicle, just 1.57 metres wide. Space had been found by lengthening the chassis to 4.22 metres, making it rather oblong. Lacking a turret or superstructure its height was also not excessive at just 1.215 metres. The small dimensions combined with a light armour \u2014 nine millimetres for the vertical riveted plates, six for the top and bottom and twelve for the cast rounded nose section \u2014 ensured a low weight: the basic TRC 37L weighs just 5.24 metric tonnes empty, the trailer adding 1.2 tonnes.\n\nGiven the vehicle's low weight, the suspension was quite robust and exceptionally reliable in comparison with other systems used on French armour of the time, that were either too complicated or too flimsy. Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie was allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the upper track run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks were  wide. The drive sprockets were in the front and driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them. Entrance to the compartment was by two wide horizontal hatches, the upper hinging upwards, allowing the driver an unobstructed view if opened, the lower hinging downwards.\n\nThe centrally positioned engine compartment was separated by a bulkhead from the driver compartment in front of it. The external silencer was on the left of the vehicle under an armoured covering. All vehicles in the series were powered by a Delahaye Type 135 six-cylinder 3.556 litre engine developing  at 2800 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 35\u00a0km/h and an average speed of 20\u00a0km/h. The wading capacity was 60 centimetres, a trench of 130 centimetres could be crossed and an incline of 50% climbed. There was a fuel supply of 114 litres, allowing for a range of 137 kilometres. There were five forward drives and one rear drive.\n\nAt the back was an armoured ammunition bin; a load of 810 kilograms can be carried, bringing the weight to 6.05 tonnes. As with the Renault UE, the TRC 37L was supplied with a tracked, armoured trailer with two road wheels per side, mostly used to carry a 565-litre fuel tank to supply the tank units; total load capacity is 690\u00a0kg for a total for the combination of 1.5 tonnes and a total weight of the trailer of 1890\u00a0kg. At 155\u00a0cm, the trailer was somewhat narrower than the main vehicle, and higher at 133\u00a0cm. It increased the length of the combination to 6.9 metres. The trailer also carried a Vulcano fuel pump and stowage boxes for lubrication oil, greases, water and assorted equipment to serve the tank maintenance teams.\n\nThe Lorraine 37Ls were painted in the standard army green, a rather greyish colour, over which a brown pattern of dark earth was sprayed.\n\nTactical function and operational history\nIn 1939, the Lorraine 37 L was gradually introduced to the supply units of the tank battalions. This coincided with a change in tactical thinking about the use of armour. In the early thirties, French doctrine had favoured the construction of ever deeper defensive belts to counter infantry infiltration tactics to defeat enemy attacks before they could develop into full-scale manoeuvre warfare, a field at which the French were aware being less adept than their most likely adversary, Germany. Expecting any possible enemy to defend himself likewise, the armour branch of the French Infantry became much preoccupied with the vexing problem of how to break through similar in-depth positions itself, emphasizing close cooperation with the foot soldier. Far less attention was paid to the next phase: the envelopment of the enemy forces.\n\nThe situation changed in the late thirties. Having at last built a considerable number of modern and well-armoured tanks, the Infantry became confident in its ability to break the enemy line, if sufficient artillery and air support was provided within a combined arms tactic. At the same time the political situation made it likely that large-scale offensives were needed to bring Germany to its knees. Though few officers advocated the creation of armoured divisions able to execute both the breakthrough and the strategic exploitation phase \u2014 these required trained personnel in numbers that simply would not be available \u2014 it was understood that the \"manoeuvre mass\" of tanks effecting the break would immediately have to envelop the defensive enemy position and defeat counterattacking enemy armour reserves, otherwise the momentum of the attack would be lost and the breach would not be kept open long enough for the motorised divisions and cavalry armoured divisions to be launched to quickly occupy and hold strategic key positions.\n\nHowever, this posed a serious logistical problem: trucks would not be able to closely follow the tanks on the battlefield. The prescribed procedure for resupplying was for the tanks to return to their start positions to be refitted. While this had still been practical in the previous war with its much slower tempo of operations, it was unacceptable in modern warfare. The tanks would have to be supplied in the field to continue their advance as soon as possible. Thus a tracked supply vehicle was needed that could overcome the expected poor terrain conditions, with many shell-craters and trenches, and it had to be armoured to protect against shell-fragments, given that the breakthrough sector would likely be in range of concentrated enemy artillery.\n\nThe type was provided to the armoured units of both the Infantry and the Cavalry. Each independent tank battalion of the Infantry, or , had an organic strength of twelve Lorraine tractors: four in the  (supply platoon) of each of its three companies. The BCCs incorporated in the armoured divisions and equipped with the Char B1 or Char B1 bis had 27 TRC 37Ls: each of their three companies had six tractors in its supply platoon and furthermore a single tractor organic to each of its three tank platoons. This extra allotment was made to compensate for the large fuel consumption of these heavy tanks, that, apart from being simply bigger, had also a rather limited range. Each group of three tanks was in their case thus directly followed by its own fuel supply.\n\nWhen, during the Battle of France, independent companies were formed, these, too, had their Lorraine tractors \u2014 an increased allotment of eight if a Char B1 bis unit, otherwise the standard allotment of four. However, the older FT 17 battalions only used fuel trucks. Likewise, the TRC 37L was not in common use in the colonies; however, when the 67e BCC, which was equipped with the Char D1, was brought over from Tunisia in June, it was provided with tractors. The motorised infantry divisions did not use the TRC 37L.\n\nIn the Cavalry, each squadron of twenty tanks had three Lorraine tractors, for a total of 24 for each mechanised light division. The AMR 35 or Panhard 178 units did not use the type, just trucks as its speed was considered insufficient. It was proposed to remedy this by fitting a stronger engine, bringing the speed to 50\u00a0km/h. The TRC 37L was also not present in the cavalry light divisions.\n\nIn practice, the supply vehicles would mainly move by road and meet with the tanks at predetermined rendez-vous points. Refuelling was relatively quick as the Vulcano could theoretically pump 565 litres in fifteen minutes. To completely refill a heavy tank would normally take about forty to sixty minutes. The trailer fuel reservoirs could themselves be replenished by the company fuel truck carrying 3600 litres of petrol. The company supplies could again be restocked from battalion stocks, moved by trucks loaded with fifty litre fuel drums. This method of distribution ensured a sufficient fuel supply on the tactical level, but was too cumbersome for strategic movements: if large distances had to be covered on track, the tanks would be directly refuelled from fuel trucks.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded on 10 May, French tank units had an organic strength of 606 Lorraine 37Ls; the numbers produced were thus insufficient to provide each unit with its official complement. About a third had to do without. That day French general headquarters decided to increase the TRC 37L strength of  and  by a half; these armoured divisions had been earmarked as reserves against an expected German breakthrough attempt in the Gembloux Gap and the low range of the Char B1 bis worried French command. To free enough tractors, , still in the process of being constituted, had to give up its twelve TRC L37s to . However, contrary to French expectations, the main German breakthrough would be at Sedan and  was sent to block it \u2014 and despite its larger number of fuel tractors,  was still surprised by  while refuelling on 15 May.\n\nDuring the campaign, the TRC 37L crews quickly saw the need for some armament and began to improvise machine-gun mounts on their vehicles.\n\nVariants\n\nThe first development from the TRC 37L was an armoured personnel carrier, the  (\"Armoured mounted infantry vehicle 38L\"). Like the TRC 37L, this Lorraine 38L was equipped with an armoured tracked trailer. The total capacity was twelve men: the driver and one passenger in the driving compartment, four in the former cargo bay, and six in the trailer. To protect the infantry squad, high box-like armoured superstructures were built over both the bin and the trailer, with doors at their back. The loaded weight of the main vehicle was 7.7 tonnes. A total of 240 VBCP 38L vehicles were ordered, of which nine had been delivered on 1 September 1939 and around 150 by 25 June 1940. In view of the war threat, the order was made before the prototype could be tested. Of all participants in the Battle of France, the French army would thus be the only to employ a fully tracked APC. The vehicles were intended for the , the (single) mechanised infantry battalion within the , or armoured division of the Infantry. However, on 10 May, they had not yet been allocated to these units, who still used half-tracks. During May, the vehicles were hurriedly taken into use by the 5e BCP and 17e BCP of the 1re DCr and 2nd DCr respectively. The 4e DCr did not receive any.\n\nAn improved model, the VBCP 39L, was created by expanding the cargo bay to carry eight passengers, apart from the two crew members. This model had no trailer and a total capacity of ten persons; extra room was found by raising the upper deck \u2014 the passenger compartment was open-topped \u2014 and constructing a more forward sloped armour glacis, contiguous with the nose section; the type thus resembled postwar APCs. Some two hundred VBCP 39L vehicles were ordered, to replace the 38L on the production lines from the 241st vehicle onwards, but none had been delivered by June 1940, the manufacture remaining limited to a single prototype. Experimental and limited production models included tank destroyers armed with 47\u00a0mm SA 47 guns () and command post vehicles; probably a  prototype was produced.\n\nVichy production\n\nIn 1939 and 1940 the type had been mainly produced in the Lorraine factory at Lun\u00e9ville. Early 1939 it was decided to erect a factory in a more southern location, less vulnerable to German bombing, at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre. This  had not made a single vehicle by the time of the armistice between France and Germany, but it was, like the other tractor-producing Fouga factory at B\u00e9ziers, located in the unoccupied zone of Vichy France. Limited production continued after June 1940 for a total of about 150, although military models were not officially produced. Some of these vehicles had a shortened chassis, their suspension consisting of only two bogies per side. Lorraine tractors were ostensively fitted for use in forestry and construction; in reality they constituted a clandestine armoured fighting vehicle production as they could be easily rebuilt. The AMX factory secretly produced armoured bodies for these vehicles, which were stockpiled. The type was called the . After the German occupation of the south of France in November 1942, many of these chassis were hidden. In the spring of 1944, the French resistance attacked the Bagn\u00e8res factory on orders from London, the allies assuming that it produced vehicles for Germany. To prevent further attacks, the resistance was informed of and involved in the affair in the summer of 1944 by the promise to arm existing vehicles for their use. The first twenty of these were delivered in January 1945, after the liberation, and the factory continued modifying vehicles for the duration of the war at a rate of about twenty a month, often by fitting an armoured superstructure, armed with a light or heavy machine-gun, to the front or back of the chassis.\n\nGerman use\nA considerable number of Lorraine tractors, about 360, fell into German hands. Due to its reliability, the type was well suited to the mobile tactics the Germans favoured in 1941 and 1942. They were first used as such, renamed the . As the Germans themselves had not produced a similar type, the Lorraine tractors filled a requirement for fully tracked supply vehicles as  or . In July and August 1942, Major Alfred Becker directed the conversion of 170 of these vehicles into the  or Marder I, a 75\u00a0mm equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun. At the same time, 106 were converted into self-propelled artillery: 94 into the  and twelve into the . Also, an artillery observation vehicle was provided: the , thirty of which were produced. A single conversion entailed the fitting of a Soviet 122\u00a0mm howitzer: the .  The Germans also employed the VBCP 38L as the Lorraine 38L(f).\n\nFor a time, it has also been assumed that a 47\u00a0mm tank destroyer conversion existed: the presumed \"4.7cm Pak181(f) auf PanzerJ\u00e4ger Lorraine Schlepper (f)\", based on preserved photographs that, however, in reality depicted the French  mentioned above, an ad hoc conversion built in June 1940.\n\nGerman designations\n  - The Lorraine tractor as captured.\n  - Supply vehicle\n  - Ammunition carrier\n  - 170 Marder I, a 7.5cm PaK40/1 equipped self-propelled anti-tank gun.\n  - 94 self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 15cm sFH13/1 howitzers.\n  - twelve self-propelled artillery vehicles, mounting 10.5cm leFH18/40 L/28 howitzers.\n  - An artillery observation vehicle, thirty of which were produced.\n  - A single conversion mounting a Soviet 122\u00a0mm howitzer on the Lorraine chassis.\n\nGallery\n\nAfter the war\nLorraine tractors were used after World War II for various experimental roles. A number were sold on the civilian market, being used to carry cranes and digging equipment. However, the factory did not secure, despite lobbying, an order from the French Army, due to the fact that so much discarded Allied mat\u00e9riel could be obtained for free. Likewise, an attempt in 1946 to export the type to Switzerland failed. Some were listed in the army inventories for a few years after the war; the last known user was Syria. The Maurice Dufresne Museum, in Azay-le-Rideau, and the State Military Technical Museum, at Ivanovskoje, exhibit surviving vehicles of the shortened version. Two vehicles of the long version are part of the collection of the  at Dresden.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  Vauvillier, Fran\u00e7ois & Jean-Michel Touraine,  Paris: Editions Ch.

The underground lake is a popular swimming spot, but it has been known to test for high levels of various pollutants, since it is fed by ground runoff.\n\nHinagdanan Cave is made of limestone. Its entrance is a hole about 1 metre in diameter, visible from a limestone hill. Cement steps lead to the interior. The cave is slippery, but there's a rope railing to hold on to. The cave is filled with sleeping birds in small holes in the ceiling. The sunlight that enters the cave make it iunsuitable for bats.\n\nHinagdanan Cave was accidentally discovered when the area's owner was clearing decaying branches. He threw a stone into the hole and heard a splash. After building a ladder to enter the cave, be named it Hinagdanan (\"laddered\").\n\nThe cave is about 100 metres long, with many beautiful stalagmite and stalactite rock formations. There is a lagoon with a green hue produced by the green limestone at its bottom. People used to bathe there, but it is no longer advised due to karst pollutants in the water.\n\nExternal links\nBohol.ph\nBohol caves\nHinagdanan Cave\nHinagdanan Cave\nHinagdanan Cave\n\nCaves of the Philippines\nLandforms of Bohol\nTourist attractions in Bohol", "machine_abstract": "The Hinagdanan cave is located in the southern part of Mount Agung, Bali Indonesia and it was discovered by I Gede Nyoman Wenten on August 18, 2005 during his expedition to find new caves along the south slope of Mt.

{"id": "T\u014dg\u014d Onsen", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Onsen", "title": "T\u014dg\u014d Onsen", "text": "T\u014dg\u014d Onsen (\u6771\u90f7\u6e29\u6cc9) is an onsen in the town of Yurihama in Tottori Prefecture, Japan. It was the second most popular onsen area in Tottori Prefecture during the beginning of the Sh\u014dwa era.\n\nHot spring type\nT\u014dg\u014d Onsen is classified as a chloride and sulfate type hot spring, with a spring source temperature of 85 to 94 degrees Celsius.\n\nT\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u2019s hot spring waters can be found near Matsuzaki station. Here, there is a 300-meter deep cavity in the layer of granite bedrock. This cavity is filled in with conglomerate sedimentary rock, called the Oshikagawa pyroclastic layer, along with diluvium and alluvium layers on top of it. T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u2019s water originates from the granite, Oshikagawa, and diluvium layers, and its heat source is thought to be waste heat from the granite layer.\n\nDescription\nThere is a large multipurpose health resort at the edge of T\u014dg\u014d Lake. Nearby is Japan\u2019s largest Chinese garden, Ench\u014d-en. The main hot spring resort area is to the east, where several Japanese ryokan inns operated up until and during Sh\u014dwa period. Currently, only two establishments, Y\u014dsh\u014dkan and the town-managed Suimeis\u014d, are in operation. Hot spring water flows out of the central part of the lake, causing steam to hang over its surface.\n\nThere are two ashiyu footbaths in the area, which are free for anyone to use. At T\u014dg\u014d-Hawai Seaside Park, there is a hot water fountain that can be used to create boiled eggs, known as onsen tamago. The other footbath is at Lake T\u014dg\u014d Lakeside Park, which also has a station for making onsen tamago. According to figures reported by the local government, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen reached its peak number of visitors from the early to mid-1970\u2019s, with more than 350,000 visitors per year. In contrast, most other hot spring areas within Tottori Prefecture reached their peak visitor count from the late 1980\u2019s to 1993.\n\nHistory\nThe existence of the hot spring was referenced in a document written in 1749. At the time, hot spring water was drawn out by bamboo tubes inserted into the bottom of the lake, in conjunction with bamboo gates. Other documents show that the residents of Kami-Asozu village in modern-day Yurihama received permission from the Tottori Domain to draw water from the hot spring in 1843; during the Ansei Period, the hot spring water was used to treat low back pain.\n\nThe origins of T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\n\nUse of the hot springs for bathing began in 1868, at the start of the Meiji Period; in 1872, a large bath tub was constructed on Ry\u016byu-t\u014d Island, which was located on the lake. A wealthy local farmer created a well for drawing spring water on the western bank of T\u014dg\u014d River, as well as a separate building called the Y\u014dsh\u014dkan, and gave access to the villagers. In 1884, this building began operating as a ryokan business. With the opening of the San'in Main Line and Matsuzaki station at the end of the Meiji Period, the number of yearly visitors reached 10,000 and the name T\u014dg\u014d Onsen was given to the area. Japanese novelist Naoya Shiga once visited the Y\u014dsh\u014dkan, and he mentions it in his short story collection Tottori. The Y\u014dsh\u014dkan is still operating today.\n\nThe origins of Matsuzaki Onsen\nAt the start of the Taish\u014d period, other areas near Matsuzaki station experienced an increase in onsen excavation. Around this time, many books about travel such as Japanese novelist Katai Tayama\u2019s Nihon Issh\u016b  (\u201cA trip round Japan\u201d) were being published, and public interest towards domestic travel was growing. Scientific surveys for onsen were also being conducted; this led to the discovery of a new hot spring source during the late Taish\u014d period, located near Matsuzaki station in T\u014dg\u014d River. As a result, many new inns were built. These inns became collectively known as \u201cMatsuzaki Onsen\u201d, and soon the names T\u014dg\u014d Onsen and Matsuzaki Onsen began to appear in documents.\n\nConsolidation into T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\nSoon after Matsuzaki Onsen was created, it was formed into an association with T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. According to the Nihon onsen taikan (Japan Onsen Encyclopedia) published in 1939, the total number of yearly lodging guests to the association\u2019s seven inns at the time was 62,000. This made it the second most-visited onsen district in Tottori Prefecture, following Misasa Onsen\u2019s 80,000 guests per year to its 20 inns.\nDuring the Edo Period, the narrow lakeshore on the eastern bank of the T\u014dg\u014d River was a strategically important location for military and transportation purposes, so there was a lodge there. During the Meiji Period, the area had grown to become Matsuzaki Village, and had its own local government. Similarly, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen and the surrounding areas formed T\u014dg\u014d Village. In 1951, Matsuzaki Village and T\u014dg\u014d Village merged to become T\u014dg\u014d-Matsuzaki Town; in 1953, this entity merged with surrounding villages to form T\u014dg\u014d Town. After this, the names of the hot springs were consolidated into \u201cT\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u201d.\n\nFrom the Meiji Period to the Sh\u014dwa Period, many famous people visited T\u014dg\u014d Onsen, such as politicians Shigenobu \u014ckuma, Shinpei Got\u014d, Yukio Ozaki, and Hiroshi Shimomura.

Cerruti's racing career began after her father Aldo 'Baronio' Cerruti, also a racing driver, decided to enrol her in a safe driving course with Mario Ferraris, son of Romeo Ferraris, a race-car tuner and constructor. Impressed by Michela's 'speed and instinctive car control', Ferraris convinced Cerruti's father to let her race.\n\nShe debuted in the Italian Touring Endurance Championship (CITE) in 2008, racing an Alfa Romeo 147, sharing the drive with Mario Ferraris, finishing third in the class standings. She remained in CITE in 2009, racing an Abarth 500.\n\nFor 2010 she stepped up to the Superstars Series, racing a Mercedes C63 AMG for the Romeo Ferraris team. She also competed in the Italian GT Championship for the team in a Ferrari F430.\n\nRemaining in the Superstars Series for a second season in 2011, Cerruti impressed at the opening weekend of the season at Monza, topping the two free practice sessions. She then went on to finish the first race in second position, before winning the second race and taking the championship lead.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Cerruti would drive for Trulli GP in the inaugural season of Formula E. After four races, she was replaced by Vitantonio Liuzzi; Cerruti had failed to record a points finish during the season, with a best finish of 12th.\n\nRacing record\n\nComplete International Superstars Series results\n(key)\n\nComplete FIA Formula 3 European Championship results\n(key)\n\nComplete Auto GP results\n(key)\n\nComplete Formula E results\n(key)\n\nComplete TCR International Series results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\u2020 Driver did not finish the race, but was classified as she completed over 90% of the race distance.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1987 births\nLiving people\nRacing drivers from Rome\nItalian racing drivers\nItalian female racing drivers\nToyota Racing Series drivers\nEuroformula Open Championship drivers\nSuperstars Series drivers\nGerman Formula Three Championship drivers\nFIA Formula 3 European Championship drivers\nBlancpain Endurance Series drivers\nEurocup M\u00e9gane Trophy drivers\nAuto GP drivers\n24 Hours of Spa drivers\nFormula E drivers\nTCR International Series drivers", "machine_abstract": "Cerruti 1881 is the fashion house founded by Italian designer and entrepreneur, Nino Cerruti in 1967.

She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the May 1958 issue, with her centerfold photographed by Ron Vogel.

In 1972, she married Roger Heffron; they had a child and divorced in 1980. In 1990, she married her third husband, director George Sidney, with whom she worked on the 1966 film The Swinger.

The subspecies E. terrestris bormansi occurs only in northern Italy and southern Switzerland.\n\nHabitat\nThis species occurs in warm mountain meadows and pastures, in open rocks and in dwarf shrubs, at an elevation of  above sea level.\n\nDescription\n\nEphippiger terrestris can reach a body length of about  in males, of about  in females, while ovipositor can reach about .\n\nThese bush crickets are usually bluish-green. However, in both sexes the body color is quite variable and often olive-green, beige and sepia-brown color variations occur. A yellowish line runs from the lower edge of the pronotum to the abdomen end. Two bright longitudinal lines run along the back sides.\n\nThe back of the head is black. The form of the pronotum is rather smooth and gently concave and resembles a saddle (the Latin name ephippium means 'saddle of a horse'). They have round small atrophied wings, protruding a few millimeters below the pronotum, that are unfit to flight and only used for the emission of sounds (stridulation). In the females the ovipositor is long and slightly curved upwards. In the male cerci stand out clearly and are cylindrical and relatively long.\n\nBiology\nAdults can be found from July to October. The larvae go through about 5 stages. These bush crickets are omnivorous. Both the male and the female can produce sounds, even if the female does so rarely and only in response to other males.\n\nBibliography\n Eades D.C., Otte D., Cigliano M.M., Braun H., Orthoptera Species File. \nBellmann & Luquet (1995), Guide des sauterelles, grillons et criquets d'Europe occidentale, Delachaux et Niestle, Lausanne 1-383 \nFontana, La Greca & Kleukers. 2006.

{"id": "Ettore Ciccotti", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore%20Ciccotti", "title": "Ettore Ciccotti", "text": "Ettore Ciccotti (Potenza, 23 March 1863 - Rome, 20 May 1939) was a historian, lecturer and politician from Italy, member of both the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Italian Senate.\n\nEarly life\nBorn into a liberal family of the lawyer Pasquale Ciccotti, a landowner and several times mayor of Potenza, he studied in the local high school. In 1879 he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Naples. He became a follower of Mazzini and adhered to Italian irredentism. He had a particular interest in both ancient history and for the social problems of Southern Italy, inspired by the example of the historian Giustino Fortunato.\n\nCiccotti, raised in the poor southern region of Basilicata, adhered to the group of socio-political thinker's known as meridionalisti (\"southernists\"), aspiring to solve the economic problems of Southern Italy after the Italian unification. They claimed that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north.\n\nAcademic and political activist\nIn 1889, Ciccotti attended the University of Rome and gained a teaching qualification in classical antiquities. He won the competition for the ancient history chair at the Scientific-Literary Academy (Accademia scientifico-letteraria) in Milan in 1891. Meanwhile, he started to cooperate with the socialist Filippo Turati and his journal Critica Sociale. He adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), where he raised the issue of the underdevelopment of Southern Italy. His political involvement caused him the hostility of the Milanese conservatives, and in 1897 he lost his position at the Academy.\n\nHe was appointed professor of ancient history at the University of Pavia, but his attacks on the government and solidarity for the workers on the occasion of the tragic events in Milan in May 1898 earned him an arrest warrant for subversive incitement. He went into exile, taking refuge in Geneva (Switzerland), hosted by Maffeo Pantaleoni. Here he met Vilfredo Pareto and the German social-democrat August Bebel, and wrote a report on the events in Milan, The revolt of Milan: Notes of a refugee, but lost his job at Pavia.\n\nAs a historian, Ciccotti was the first to give a Marxist economic account of the decline of slavery in the Roman Empire, in contrast to religious-ethical explanations in his book Il tramonto della schiavitu nel mondo antico (The Sunset of Slavery in the Ancient World), published in 1899. Economic changes rendered slavery expensive and inefficient, and doomed it to extinction.\n\nPolitical career\nIn June 1900, he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies (1900-1904) in the Vicaria district of Naples, upsetting the traditional electoral alliance between local politicians and the Camorra. In 1904, he lost his seat due to active campaigning of the Camorra against him. He was re-elected in 1909 and remained a Deputy until September 1919. Meanwhile, Ciccotti initiated the translation in Italian of the major works of the Socialist theorists Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ferdinand Lassalle.\n\nIn the decade before the First World War, he gradually distanced himself more and more from the official line of the Socialist Party, although he kept on contributing to the socialist newspaper Avanti!. He criticized the party, which he considered to be too much focused on the problems of the \"Northern\", industrialist working man, and too little inclined to understand the problems of the impoverished rural populace of the South. Ciccotti defined the prejudices against southern Italians as the anti-Semitism of Italy. In contrast with the PSI, he was in favour of an Italian intervention in the First World War.\n\nSenator and death\nHis pro-war stance and dislike of the liberal Giovanni Giolitti \u2013 Ciccotti called Giolittianism the \"death of political life\" \u2013, and in opposition to the post-war revolutionary movements, he looked sympathetically at the rising Fascism an its leader Benito Mussolini. \"In today's evident scarcity of political personalities, Mussolini is the one that more than any other, if not the only one, can deserve this name,\" Ciccotti wrote in September 1922.\n\nIn September 1924, he was rewarded with a seat for life in the Italian Senate. He opposed the move to authoritarian rule of Mussolini, but did not resign. He mainly dedicated his time to study history. In 1931, when demanded to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, Ciccotti initially protested, but eventually took the oath all the same. Finally he opposed, and openly, to the dictatorship of Mussolini when he sensed that the regime was heading to the adventure of a war, which he considered the inevitable conclusion of authoritarian and populist regimes. He died in Rome on 20 May 1939 at the age of 76.\n\nReferences\n\n De Grand, Alexander J. (2001).

{"id": "When God Writes Your Love Story", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When%20God%20Writes%20Your%20Love%20Story", "title": "When God Writes Your Love Story", "text": "When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. The authors advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the spouse that God has planned for them. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.\n\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nOther American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,\" in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.\n\nBackground\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,  is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nEric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.\n\nBefore the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.\n\nContent\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, \"Desiring a Love Story\", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, \"Preparing for a Love Story\", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, \"Waiting for a Love Story\", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, \"Sweetening a Love Story\", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, \"Discovering a God-written Love Story\", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.\n\nEarly in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a \"sweeter song\" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the \"sweeter song\" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is \"the beautiful side of love\"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.\n\nThe Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, \"if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry\u00a0... is alive and wandering the earth\" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of \"true love\" as an emotion; instead, they define \"true love\" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that \"there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied\u00a0... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others\u00a0... our deepest needs are met as well!\"\n\nLeslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question \"How will I know when a relationship is from God?\" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a \"team\u00a0... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective.\" She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nCritical response\n\nDiscussions of context\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and \"desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks.\" Gardner argues that the result \"was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.\"\n\nIn the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.\n\nChristian responses to the book's advice\n\nChristine A. Col\u00f3n and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Col\u00f3n, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that \"the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God\" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Col\u00f3n and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states \"the more delay'd, delighted.\" Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.\n\nCol\u00f3n and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Col\u00f3n and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that \"God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.\"\n\nMargaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called \"Christian Marriage\" and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story.\" They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, \"it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.\" In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that \"it is the entire genre that is problematic.\"\n\nRick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.\n\nCommentators have also noted the song \"Faithfully\" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies \"Faithfully\" as one of her favourite songs.\n\nIn 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because \"it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together \u2014 because it wasn't happening for me.\" She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be \"mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples.\"\n\nIn 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis pregnancy center operated by Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles \u2014 Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n Ellerslie, official website of Eric and Leslie Ludy\n\n1999 non-fiction books\n1999 in Christianity\n1999 in the United States\n20th-century Christian texts\nAmerican non-fiction books\nBooks about spirituality\nChristian devotional literature\nChristian theology books\nDating\nEnglish-language books\nEvangelicalism in the United States\nCollaborative non-fiction books\nMarriage in Christianity\nRandom House books\nSexual abstinence and religion\nNon-fiction books about sexuality\nSexuality in Christianity\nYoung adult non-fiction books", "machine_abstract": "The film is about the life of American missionary Jim Elliot, who was murdered by natives in Ecuador on March 21, 1956.\nIt stars Kevin Sorbo and Amy Jo Johnson as Jim's wife Jeannie", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"When God Writes Your Love Story\".

It is located on the Greater London border with Kent, bordering the Dartford Borough. It is located north west of Dartford.\n\nHistory\n\nUp until the Victorian era it was a hamlet a kilometre downstream of Crayford where no more than sixteen homes were clustered. A calico-printing works drew water power from the culverted River Wansunt in early Victorian times, being later adapted for the manufacture of rubber goods, then felt and finally Brussels carpets. This carpet mill was demolished by 1890 and Barnes Cray House, the next largest building, was cleared by 1933, ending its days as a nursing home.\n\nThe remnants of the settlement became absorbed into Crayford with the building of a munition village to facilitate the expansion of Vickers' armaments factory during the 1915 to 1919 period.\nIn 1920 the area became part of the Crayford Urban District of Kent (having previously been in Dartford Rural District). \nFollowing World War I Crayford Urban District Council erected further housing estates to the north, eventually merging with estates spreading southwards from Erith. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the urban district was abolished and its area transferred to Greater London to form part of the present-day London Borough of Bexley.\n\nThe Geoffrey Whitworth Theatre is in Barnes Cray.\n\nThe site of the current Barnes Cray Primary School is the proposed site for a new Academy for ages 3\u201319, which was consulted upon from September - December 2008, and the primary school will convert to the Academy in September 2009, with the secondary part of the Academy due to open in September 2010.\n\nTransport\nBarnes Cray is served by the Transport for London bus service 428 to Erith via Slade Green and to Bluewater via Dartford.

{"id": "Unicase", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase", "title": "Unicase", "text": "A unicase or unicameral alphabet has just one case for its letters. Arabic, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Old Hungarian (Hungarian Runic), Hebrew, Iberian, Georgian, and Hangul are unicase writing systems, while (modern) Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Armenian are bicameral, as they have two cases for each letter, e.g., B/b, \u0392/\u03b2, \u0411/\u0431, \u0532/\u0562. Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, \u02bbokina (), used in Polynesian languages, and glottal stop (\u0294) as used in Nuu-chah-nuulth.\n\nMost alphabets today with two cases were once unicase, Latin, used to be written with a unicase alphabet in imperial Roman times; it was only later that scribes developed new sets of symbols for running text, which became the lower case of the Latin alphabet, while the letterforms of Ancient Rome came to be called capitals or upper case.\n\nA unicase version of the Latin alphabet was proposed by Michael Mann and David Dalby in 1982 as a variation of the Niamey African Reference Alphabet. This version has apparently never been actively used. Another example of unicase Latin alphabet is the Initial Teaching Alphabet. Occasionally some fonts use unicase designs to create an unusual effect; this was particularly popular in the 1960s.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet only uses lowercase Latin (and Greek) letters and some scaled upper-case letters (small caps), effectively making it a unicase alphabet, although it is not used for ordinary writing of any language.\n\nLatin alphabets in modern times that are unicase include Saanich (uppercase except for the suffix -s) in Canada, and palawa kani (lowercase) of Tasmania in Australia.\n\nSee also\nAlphabet 26\nLetter case\n\nReferences\n\nGeorgian Nuskhuri, Unicode 4.1.0, \n\nWriting systems\nOrthography\nTypography", "machine_abstract": "The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0 (2015), defines the following categories of characters as unicase:[3][4]\nCharacters in category Unicase are those that have no uppercase or lowercase form.\nCharacters in subcategory Letterlike_Symbols_Unicase are letter-like symbols which do not use any part of their shape to indicate case and therefore cannot be distinguished from each other by means of upper- and lower-case forms alone; they may also include punctuation marks such as quotation marks.

Owned by Canadian Refractories Limited, the railway's 20km mainline stretched from CRL's magnesite mine in Kilmar, through an extremely rugged mountain route to its final terminus at Marelan. Originally a narrow-gauge railway from 1916 to 1933, the Dominion Timber and Minerals Railway expanded to include a 65-ton locomotive and several freight cars.\n\nDue to rising operating costs and decreasing sustainability, the railway was decommissioned in 1981, with many of the railway ties being dumped into lakes along the route by workmen. Until 2012 the abandoned rail route has been popular among ATV and dirt bike riders, however the upcoming sale of the land will permanently limit trespassing on this now-closed trail.\n\nExternal links\nhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19810723&id=0qMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5u4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1189,1544893\n\nhttp://www.exporail.org/can_rail/Canadian%20Rail_no368_1982.pdf\n\nDefunct Quebec railways", "machine_abstract": "The Dominion Timber & Mineral Railway (DTMR) was built in the 1920s to transport timber from logging camps on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada westward across the Georgia Strait into Alaska.\nIt is now part of Canadian National Railways' Pacific Great Eastern Division network as CN Route 761", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Dominion Timber and Minerals Railway\".

{"id": "Ruth Cardoso", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth%20Cardoso", "title": "Ruth Cardoso", "text": "Ruth Vila\u00e7a Correia Leite Cardoso (September 19, 1930 \u2013 June 24, 2008) was a Brazilian anthropologist and a former member of the Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and Human Sciences at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (FFLCH-USP). She was the wife of 34th President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and First Lady of her country between January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002. She too was a Ph.D in anthropology from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nAs professor and researcher Cardoso taught at the Latin American College of Social Sciences (Flacso/Unesco), University of Chile (Santiago), Maison des Sciences de L'Homme (Paris), University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University (New York City). She was an associate member of the Center for Latin American Studies of the University of Cambridge. With her husband, the sociologist and former president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  she founded and later directed the research institute Cebrap (Centro Brasileiro de An\u00e1lise e Planejamento \u2013 Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning), which continues to be a leading site of social science research in Brazil.\n\nDr. Cardoso\u2019s academic reputation rests primarily on a series of highly influential articles and book chapters on popular movements and political participation that she published in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil\u2019s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the \"new\" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.\n\nUnlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program.  She published a book about these experiences,  Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office.\n\nShe died in S\u00e3o Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest. She had been discharged from the S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas Hospital the previous day, June 23, 2008, having previously been admitted with chest pains.\n\nPublications \n\nBooks\n\n Bibliografia Sobre a Juventude (with Helena Sampaio, Edusp, 1995)\n Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002)\n\nArticles and miscellaneous works\n\n 1983: Movimentos Sociais Urbanos: Balan\u00e7o Cr\u00edtico.

{"id": "Paul Drinkhall", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20Drinkhall", "title": "Paul Drinkhall", "text": "Paul Drinkhall (born 16 January 1990) is a British table tennis player. He won the English Championship in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017.\n\nCareer\n\nDrinkhall was born in Middlesbrough. He enjoyed much success as a youngster, winning numerous national championships at his age level, and at levels above his own age. This success did not go unnoticed, as he was shortlisted for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2005, and finished in second place after Theo Walcott in 2006. He was again shortlisted for this award in 2007. He once again finished in 2nd place in 2007.\n\nIn April 2008 Drinkhall signed with the German team TTC Indeland J\u00fclich for the 2008\u201309 season, having previously played for another German club, Goennern. In December 2008 he was runner-up at the World Junior Table Tennis Championships in Madrid, losing to Chen Chien-an in the final. In 2010 Drinkhall signed with the Belgian Super Division club Nodo TTC Ekeren.\n\nAt the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi he won a silver medal in the Men's Team event and a bronze medal in the Mixed Doubles events.\n\nDrinkhall has been National Champion in every age group so far eligible to compete in - Under 10, Under 11, Under 12, Under 14, Under 17, and Senior Men. Paul became the youngest player since Chester Barnes to win the English Senior Men's title in Sheffield in March 2007 when he overcame the much more experienced former champion Alex Perry from Devon in the 4 - 1 contest.\n\nDrinkhall moved to Italy in September 2011, joining the Sterilgarda club with the intention of raising his performances in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\n2012 Olympic Games\nPaul Drinkhall qualified for the 2012 Olympic games through a host nation place. In the singles event, Paul defeated Kuwait's Ibrahim Alhasan 4\u20130 in the preliminary round then beat world ranked 52, Yang Zi from Singapore. In the last 32 stage, Paul lost to Germany's Dimitrij Ovtcharov.\n\nPost-2012 Olympics\nIn 2012 Drinkhall joined Werder Bremen's table tennis team and returned to the table tennis Bundesliga after previous spells with Goennern, TTC Indeland J\u00fclich and SV Pl\u00fcderhausen. Paul was part of the Werder Bremen team that won the Bundesliga that season.\n\nPaul Drinkhall married Joanna Parker, also a professional table tennis player and a multiple English champion, in August 2013.\n\nDrinkhall became only the second English player (after Carl Prean) to win a tournament on the ITTF World Tour Open circuit when he won the Spanish Open in April 2014. This was the first win for a British player in a World Tour singles event in 18 years.\n\nThe following month he was part of the England men's team which clinched promotion to the top level of world table tennis at the World Team Championships in Japan.\n\nIn June 2014 it was announced that he would be leaving Werder Bremen and rejoining TTC Nodo for the 2014\u201315 season in order to obtain more playing time, although Werder said that Drinkhall would continue to train with the German club when he was not playing for Nodo or the English national team. Paul won the Belgian League that same season with Nodo.\n\nDrinkhall represented England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, winning a silver medal in the team competition as Singapore took gold in a repeat of the 2010 result. Paul and Joanna Drinkhall subsequently won a gold in the mixed doubles competition, defeating fellow English pairing Liam Pitchford and Tin-Tin Ho in the final. \n\nIn November 2014, Drinkhall reached the final of the Russian Open, beating several top-25 players along the way, including top seed Dimitrij Ovtcharov and third seed Marcos Freitas. His results on the ITTF World Tour meant he qualified for the Grand Finals to be played in Bangkok in December, becoming the first Englishman to compete at the event since 1996. His performances also lifted him to a new career high of No 33 in the ITTF world rankings.\n\nAt the inaugural European Games in Baku in June 2015, Drinkhall was seeded 16 and reached the semi-finals, losing to top seed Dimitrij Ovtcharov. He was then beaten in the bronze medal play-off by Lei Kou.\n\nIn November 2015, Drinkhall won the men's singles at the Aquece Rio International Tournament - the test event for the Rio Olympics.\n\nIn March 2016, Drinkhall was part of the England team, alongside Liam Pitchford and Sam Walker, which won bronze medals at the World Team Championships in Malaysia, England's first medal at that level since 1983 and the first time a newly promoted team had earned a podium place at the event.\n\nThe same month, he won the national men's singles title for the fifth time in his career.\n\nDrinkhall represented Team GB in singles and team event at the Rio 2016 Olympics, becoming only the third Brit in history to reach the last 16 stage of the singles. In the team event, alongside Liam Pitchford and Sam Walker, he helped GB beat France in the first round, before GB were knocked out by China.\n\nIn March 2017, Paul became the English Senior National Champion for the 6th time with a 4\u20132 victory over Sam Walker in the final.\n\nIn February 2018, Drinkhall was part of the England squad alongside Liam Pitchford, Sam Walker, David McBeath and Tom Jarvis which won bronze medals by reaching the semi-finals of the ITTF Team World Cup in front of a home crowd at the Copper Box Arena in London.\n\nAt the Commonwealth Games in Australia in 2018, Drinkhall won the gold medal in the men's doubles alongside Liam Pitchford and was part of the England squad which won men's team bronze, alongside Pitchford, Sam Walker and David McBeath.\n\nIn 2019, Drinkhall became the first English player to win two ITTF World Tour events when he won the Serbia Open.\n\nIn 2021, Drinkhall qualified for the Tokyo Olympics at the last minute following Samsonov's abrupt withdrawal from the event.\n\nSee also\n List of England players at the World Team Table Tennis Championships\n\nReferences\n\n1990 births\nLiving people\nEnglish male table tennis players\nCommonwealth Games silver medallists for England\nCommonwealth Games bronze medallists for England\nTable tennis players at the 2010 Commonwealth Games\nTable tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics\nTable tennis players at the 2016 Summer Olympics\nOlympic table tennis players of Great Britain\nTable tennis players at the 2014 Commonwealth Games\nTable tennis players at the 2015 European Games\nEuropean Games competitors for Great Britain\nCommonwealth Games gold medallists for England\nCommonwealth Games medallists in table tennis\nTable tennis players at the 2018 Commonwealth Games\nTable tennis players at the 2019 European Games\nTable tennis players at the 2020 Summer Olympics", "machine_abstract": "Paul David Drinkhall (born 16 May 1986) is a British professional tennis player who reached his highest singles ranking of No. Paul has won two ATP Challenger Tour titles, in 2009 and 2010 at the Nottingham Open.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Paul Drinkhall\".

{"id": "Hot game", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot%20game", "title": "Hot game", "text": "\n\nIn combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics, a hot game is one in which each player can improve their position by making the next move. \n\nBy contrast, a cold game is one where each player can only worsen their position by making the next move.  Cold games have values in the surreal numbers and so can be ordered by value, while hot games can have other values.\n\nExample\nFor example, consider a game in which players alternately remove tokens of their own color from a table, the Blue player removing only blue tokens and the Red player removing only red tokens, with the winner being the last player to remove a token.  Obviously, victory will go to the player who starts off with more tokens, or to the second player if the number of red and blue tokens are equal.  Removing a token of one's own color leaves the position slightly worse for the player who made the move, since that player now has fewer tokens on the table.  Thus each token represents a \"cold\" component of the game.\n\nNow consider a special purple token bearing the number \"100\", which may be removed by either player, who then replaces the purple token with 100 tokens of their own color.  (In the notation of Conway, the purple token is the game {100|\u2212100}.)  The purple token is a \"hot\" component, because it is highly advantageous to be the player who removes the purple token.  Indeed, if there are any purple tokens on the table, players will prefer to remove them first, leaving the red or blue tokens for last.  In general, a player will always prefer to move in a hot game rather than a cold game, because moving in a hot game improves their position, while moving in a cold game injures their position.\n\nTemperature\nThe temperature of a game is a measure of its value to the two players.  A purple \"100\" token has a temperature of 100 because its value to each player is 100 moves.  In general, players will prefer to move in the hottest component available.  For example, suppose there is a purple \"100\" token and also a purple \"1,000\" token which allows the player who takes it to dump 1,000 tokens of their own color on the table.  Each player will prefer to remove the \"1,000\" token, with temperature 1,000 before the \"100\" token, with temperature 100.\n\nTo take a slightly more complicated example, consider the game {10|2}\u00a0+\u00a0{5|\u22125}.  {5|\u22125} is a token which either player may replace with 5 tokens of their own color, and {10|2} is a token which the Blue player may replace with 10 blue tokens or the Red player may replace with 2 blue tokens.\n\nThe temperature of the {10|2} component is \u00bd(10\u00a0\u2212\u00a02) =\u00a04, while the temperature of the {5|\u22125} component is 5.  This suggests that each player should prefer to play in the {5|\u22125} component.  Indeed, the best first move for the Red player is to replace {5|\u22125} with \u22125, whereupon the Blue player replaces {10|2} with 10, leaving a total of 5; had the Red player moved in the cooler {10|2} component instead, the final position would have been 2\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0=\u00a07, which is worse for Red.  Similarly, the best first move for the Blue player is also in the hotter component, from {5|-5} to 5, even though moving in the {10|2} component produces more blue tokens in the short term.\n\nSnort \n\nIn the game of Snort, Red and Blue players take turns coloring the vertices of a graph, with the constraint that two vertices that are connected by an edge may not be colored differently.   As usual, the last player to make a legal move is the winner.  Since a player's moves improve their position by effectively reserving the adjacent vertices for them alone, positions in Snort are typically hot.  In contrast, in the closely related game Col, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color, positions are usually cold.\n\nApplications\n\nThe theory of hot games has found some application in the analysis of endgame strategy in Go.\n\nSee also\n\n Domineering, another game in which hot positions arise\n Cooling and heating (combinatorial game theory), operations to make hot games amenable to the same type of analysis as cold games\n\nReferences \n\n \n \n\nCombinatorial game theory", "machine_abstract": "The hot game is played on the beach, in which players throw sticks at each other's feet to remove them from their sandals.\nHot Game (also known as Hot Foot) - The object of this game is to get your opponent\u2019s footwear off by throwing sticks or stones into his/her sandal straps and sole.

It stars Mammootty in the title role. The film tells the story of B. R. Ambedkar, known mainly for his contributions in the emancipation of the downtrodden and oppressed classes in India and shaping the Constitution of India, as the chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constituent Assembly.\n\nDr. Babasaheb Ambedkar won the National Film Awards for Best feature film in English, Best Actor (Mammootty) and Best Art Direction (Nitin Chandrakant Desai) in 1999. The film was screened retrospective on August 15, 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defence, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day.\n\nPlot\nBhimrao Ambedkar studying in Columbia University library is approached by Lala Lajpat Rai to join his home rule league but Ambedkar refuses to do so as he came here on the scholarship of his highness Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda State. Ambedkar is unable to afford studying in America so he also works part-time jobs washing plates and cleaning. \n\nHe passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of sociology, history, philosophy and anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy. In 1916 he completed his second thesis, National Dividend of India - A Historic and Analytical Study for another M.A. In October 1916, he enrolled for the Bar course at Gray's Inn, and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. 1917 The term of his scholarship from Baroda ended, so that he was obliged to go back to India in June with his work unfinished; he was, however, given permission to return and finish within four years. He sent his precious and much-loved collection of books back on a steamer\u2014but it was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine Ambedkar went to Baroda State to work as a probationer in the Accountant General's Office . A scholarship of 11.50 British pounds a month, for three years, was awarded to the young Ambedkar and per the agreement he has to serve baroda for 10 years after the completion of his studies. However, upon arriving in Baroda, he realized that none of the Hindu hotels would allow his to stay due to his lower caste. He found a Parsi inn, but here, non-Parsis were not allowed to stay. He and the Parsi inn-keeper reached a compromise, where by Ambedkar gave his name as a Parsi, and was allowed to stay. After joining the new office as a new senior officer (Probationary officer) being an untouchable the peon of the office doesn't give him file in his hand he throw files on his table, Ambedkar feel thirsty and ask for a glass of water, the peon says there is no water when he goes on to drink water from the pot, Upper caste people finds this very uncomfortable and insult him and he is not allowed to drink water from that pot as they think by his touch it will pollute the water so they tell him to bring his own water and call him dirty and untouchable. After a few days of stay in Baroda it is discovered by other Parsis, that he is not Parsi and on the eleventh day of his stay, a group of angry Parsi men, armed with sticks, arrived to remove him from the inn. He had to leave the inn that very day, and not having a place to stay, was forced to leave Baroda and return to Bombay to find work elsewhere.\n\nIn Bombay, Ambedkar applies for the post of professorship as professor of political economy in Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics. On the first day of his job the students makes fun of him thinking what this untouchable will teach them does he know how to speak English. In the staff room when Ambedkar approaches towards water pot to drink water a professor named Trivedi doesn't like it and insults him. Ambedkar is approached by Shri Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur and Ambedkar starts a newspaper called Mooknayak in the year 1920. Ambedkar took a conference in Mangaon in Kolhapur it was attended by Shri Shahu Maharaj. The Maharaj declared in a prophetic vein \"You have found your saviour in Ambedkar and I am confident that he will break your shackles\".\n\nCast\nMammootty as Dr. B. R.

It was made at a budget of  8.95 crore. The production was managed by the government-owned National Film Development Corporation of India.\n\nIn an interview with  Pritish Nandy  of Rediff.com, director Jabbar Patel said that the research and filming took three years each. The government said they wanted a film on the scale of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. For the role of Ambedkar, they considered hundreds of actors around the world. Patel claimed that, in that search, they also sought Robert De Niro who was very keen on the role but backed off when he was told that he had to drop his American accent and speak the way Ambedkar did -- in his typically \"clipped Indo-British accent\". Mammootty was cast by chance when Patel saw his picture on a magazine and felt he had some resemblance with Ambedkar. Mammootty was initially resistant to be cast as that would have meant shaving off his mustache, recalls Patel. Since there were no footage of Ambedkar available to them, his body language and way of talking was to be done out of imagination. The film was simultaneously shot in English and Hindi.\n\nAlthough Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was certified in 1998, it was released commercially in 2000.\n\nMusic\n\nAwards\nThe film won  National Film Awards (India) in 1999.\n Best Actor - Mammootty\n Best Art Direction - Nitin Chandrakant Desai\n\nSee also\n List of artistic depictions of Mahatma Gandhi\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nIndian films\n2000 films\n2000 biographical drama films\nFilms about B.

The first issue was published on 22 July 1922, and for the first four weeks it was published only on Saturday evenings; from 16 August 1922 it introduced a Wednesday afternoon edition. Printed on pink paper, it was published by Walter R. May for The Herald and Weekly Times at corner Flinders and Russell streets, Melbourne. Initially the Saturday edition was priced at 2d, and the larger Wednesday edition at 3d. With the introduction of the Wednesday edition it also widened its coverage beyond purely sport, acquiring the subtitle \"A Journal of Sport, the Stage and the Screen\". However, during 1924 it dropped the subtitle and returned to covering purely sport.\n\nThe Saturday edition of the newspaper played an important part in Melbourne's football culture, particularly before the introduction of television to Australia in 1956: the newspaper was released one to two hours after the completion of the afternoon's Victorian Football League games, and contained results and match reports. \n\nFormer writers at the newspaper noted that the expansion of television coverage of football reduced the Sporting Globes utility and readership, along with the preference for cars over public transport; ultimately the Saturday evening edition was discontinued in 1979, with the final Wednesday edition being published on 2 September 1996.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nDefunct newspapers published in Melbourne\nPublications established in 1922\nPublications disestablished in 1996\nWeekly newspapers published in Australia\nNewspapers on Trove\nSports newspapers published in Australia", "machine_abstract": "The Sporting Globe was the first British sports newspaper, founded in 1845 by John Graham Chambers and William Henry Harrison as The Sportsman (later renamed to The Athlete).

It is a freeway for its entire length. Its southern terminus is at County Road\u00a02209 (CR\u00a02209) in St. Johns County. Its northern terminus is at the southeast-most point on Interstate\u00a0295 (I-295). The highway is planned to be renamed to Interstate\u00a0795 (I-795) when the designation is approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).\n\nRoute description\nState Road 9B begins at an interchange with Saint Johns Parkway (County Road 2209) in St. Johns, heading north as a four-lane divided highway. The road heads through Peyton Parkway (Race Track Road Connector) and Interstate 95 before expanding as a six lane expressway. The road continues north for  where it passes over Phillips Highway (US 1). The road then continues north for another  where it terminates at an interchange with Interstate 295.\n\nHistory\n\nIn May 2008 the project was suspended by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) but it was reinstated in 2010 when funding was acquired via stimulus funds.\n\nPhase 1\nPhase 1 of the SR\u00a09B/I-795 project, consisting of a  spur from the Eastern Beltway of I-295 to US\u00a01, began in the middle of 2010 and was scheduled to be completed in early of 2013, at an estimated cost of $68.5 million. The winning contract went to Archer Western Contractors / GAI Consultants, who also reconstructed the I-10/I-95 interchange in downtown Jacksonville. The roadway was originally planned to open in the end of 2012, but was pushed back to 2013 to allow for the construction of a wider paved area to facilitate future expansion. In late July 2013, southbound I-295 was closed a few nights to install new overhead signs for the SR\u00a09B interchange, one of the final construction projects of Phase 1. Phase 1 opened September 19, 2013.\n\nPhase 2\nSuperior Construction and Arcadis US was awarded a $95 million design-build contract for the second phase of SR\u00a09B, from US\u00a01 to I-95. Construction began in April 2013 and was fully completed on June 13, 2016. Phase\u00a02 includes a new four-lane road between US\u00a01 and I-95. The Phase\u00a01 interchange at US\u00a01 is upgraded with additional exit ramps and an overpass over US\u00a01 and Veveras Drive in addition to utility work along US\u00a01. A cloverstack interchange at I-95 was constructed, along with noise walls in the northwest and southeast corners.\n\nPhase 3\nPhase 3 consisted of extending State Road 9B  south of the Interstate 95 interchange. The third and final phase connected I-95 to County Road 2209 and Race Track Road via a connector road (named Peyton Parkway) in St. Johns County. Construction began on September 9, 2015 and opened to traffic on August 9, 2018.\n\nExit list\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official project site\n Plans for SR 9B in St. Johns County\n St. Johns River Crossing Corridor Study\n\n009B\n009B\n009B\n009B\nRoads in St. Johns County, Florida\nExpressways in Duval County, Florida\n\nFreeways in the United States", "machine_abstract": "The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) maintains and operates the state highway system in Florida, United States.\nState Route 9B is one of several numbered routes that make up part of Interstate 4's southern bypass around Jacksonville, Florida.

{"id": "Alpha Rho Upsilon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%20Rho%20Upsilon", "title": "Alpha Rho Upsilon", "text": "Alpha Rho Upsilon ( in Greek, ARU in Latin/English; pronounced A-roo) was a fraternity at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1946 until it was disbanded in 1990. Until then it occupied a late Victorian wood-frame house at 238 Maine Street.\n\nFounding and history\nAn offshoot of the Thorndike Club, a dining club formed in 1937 for non-fraternity students at the college, ARU was founded in 1946 by a group of Bowdoin students, who included World War II veterans, in reaction to the exclusion of Jewish and African American students from the other campus fraternities at the time. The letters ARU stood for \"All Races United,\" and they lived up to their name by, for example, sponsoring a Japanese student in 1951. History Professor Ernst Christian Helmreich was the faculty adviser to the Thorndike Club from 1937\u20131946. German Professor Fritz Carl August Koelln was the fraternity's long-time faculty adviser. Recognizing the discriminatory practices of the fraternity system of that era against African American and Jewish students, Professors Helmreich and Koelln played significant roles in the formation of ARU as a fraternity that welcomed students of all religions and ethnic backgrounds into its fellowship. That the Thorndike Club and, hence, ARU came into existence is a testament to the sadness of the family of man divided on the basis of skin color, ethnicity or religious belief. The meaning of ARU was never lost by its Brothers.\n\nARU initially resided in Moore Hall, one of Bowdoin's dormitories, then moved to a former faculty housing hall at 264 Maine Street before purchasing their 238 Maine Street home from the Sigma Nu fraternity.\n\nAn architectural hybrid of Colonial Revival and the Shingle Style featuring Palladian windows, gambrels, peaked dormers and a balconied front porch with Ionic columns, the ARU house was built between 1894 and 1900 as the residence of George Taylor and Edith Davis Files. An 1889 Bowdoin graduate, George Files was a German professor at the college until his death in 1919 upon returning from France, where he had helped the YMCA with the war effort. In 1921, Mrs. Files endowed the George Taylor Files Professorship in Modern Languages at Bowdoin and sold their house to Sigma Nu, who in turn sold it to ARU in 1951 upon relocating to the college's present Hartley Cone Baxter House.  The \"new wing\" was added in the rear in 196? [NEED DATE] with six double rooms and two bathrooms.\n\nThe other college-sanctioned fraternities at Bowdoin were local chapters of national fraternities that opposed admission of \"minorities\" and women to their ranks.  Bowdoin first admitted women as freshmen in 1971, but admitted women as exchange students, and then transfers, starting in 196? NEED DATE. ARU voted to become co-ed immediately when women were first female exchange students were accepted, and many joined ARU.  Bowdoin's first woman graduate, transfer Susan Jacobs '70, is an ARU.\n\nGovernance\nThe ARU Executive Board, elected by popular vote of the fraternity members, comprised a President, Vice President, Treasurer, Social Chairman, Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretary, Steward, Freshman Orientation Chairman, Guest Night Chairman and Historian. In honor of the fraternity's World War II veteran origins, coinciding with the \"Flyers\" nickname (see below), the Executive Board was informally called the Strategic Air Command, and its first six positions were nicknamed Pilot, Co-pilot, Navigator, Tailgunner, Log Keeper and Radioman, respectively. Each elected official gave his/her own report at the fraternity's weekly house meetings. For a period in the early 1970s into the mid-1980s there was an ad hoc \"Joint Chiefs\" committee.\n\nActivities and traditions\nAnnual ARU activities and traditions included:\n Work Week, the week prior to the start of a new school year, when fraternity members arrived early to clean and prep the house for Rush Week.\n Rush Week, the week before college classes began, when all fraternities sought new members from the incoming freshman class by holding open-invitation parties at their houses. Selected freshmen were invited to join a fraternity by receiving \"bids\" from its underclassmen, by consent of the entire membership.\n Drop Night, when fraternities held dress-up banquets to welcome new members, who would join by showing up at the fraternity they had chosen.\n Hell Night, ARU's new-member initiation, which included a comically spooky ritual in which each new member was asked questions about why they joined ARU, what they planned to contribute to it, etc.\n Sacrifice of the Virgin Pumpkin, a purification ceremony that non-believers may have viewed as a Halloween costume parade around campus.  At the high point of the event, a senior class member designated as \"High Priest\", chosen by his predecessor, ritually sacrificed the Virgin Pumpkin - one not tainted by commercialism and procured illicitly - by casting it from ARU's front, second story balcony onto the granite carriage step (removed during street reconstruction) next to the Maine Street curb, smashing the Pumpkin into pieces. A sherry reception (Harvey's Bristol Cream) followed. The rite started in reaction to a notorious event that occurred in the House in the mid-1960s that almost caused the House to be closed.  The Sacrifice warded off the evils that almost destroyed the House. In 1971, a brother composed a processional hymn for the Sacrifice to the tune of an old Yiddish song: \"Holy and pure virgin pumpkin, solemn we follow thee / Holy and pure virgin pumpkin, solemn we follow thee / Fertile, undefiled, regal in satin clad / Blessed vegetable in the ninth year of the bag.\"  (The \"ninth year of the bag\" would indicate that the Sacrifice dated back to 1962; presumably, the hymn composer had done some research.)  The emphasis of the Sacrifice ceremony was on purity.  The High Priest, in particular, needed exceptional pureness.  English majors were preferred, although majors in other pure subjects, such as Classics, Religion, and Math, were looked on favorably.  The High Priest would consult with other seniors before selecting his successor from the junior class.  The other celebrants, also selected carefully, were the Pumpkin Bearer, who carried the Blessed Vegetable on a silk pillow, and two Guards who ritualistically defended the entire procession and ceremony from the insults and attacks of the Devil's Advocate.  All ARU's were expected to participate in the ceremony by first getting as purified as possible at the house.  At about 1130 pm the High Priest and his entourage would don their mystical vestments.  All the other Ru's would at least throw a sheet over their shoulders.  The procession crossed Maine Street and went to the Chapel steps for the Consecration of the Virgin.  The priest then led the devoted to the Walker steps where he delivered an Oratory.  The procession then returned to Chapel Walk and crossed to block Maine Street while the High Priest, Pumpkin Bearer, and Guards ascended to the balcony over the front porch.  Raising the Blessed Vegetable over his head, the High Priest would shout something profound (Chris Gahran in '73: \"Cancel my rumba lessons!\") as he threw the Chaste Gourd to the ground to the acclaim of the faithful, now assured that ARU was protected from untoward events for another year.  Light refreshments and further purification followed.\n The Art Exhibit, where members showed off their creations. A team of judges picked a winner.\n The Butterman, the annual mysterious appearance of a pat of butter on a structural component of the dining hall (a ceiling beam, etc.) with no fraternal knowledge of who put it there.\n Beethoven's Birthday, an interfaith winter holiday party for members and invited guests, which included a \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. The event originally started as a celebration of the founding of the House, which occurred close to Beethoven's Birthday.  Beethoven's evolved into a \"formal\" party.  The Ru's dressed up and Beethoven symphonies played on the downstairs sound system.  The faculty were cordially invited to a good dinner and to partake of an open bar.  ARU's bar was acknowledged as the best on campus, and many faculty attended.  President Howell was a regular.  This event served the dual purpose of a chance to blow off steam before first-semester finals while simultaneously brown-nosing the faculty.\n Mr. ARU, a talent contest where selected contestants presented comic acts, song-and-dance acts, etc., vying for the \"Mr. ARU\" and \"Mr. Congeniality\" prizes.\n The Prom, a dance for members and their in-house or guest dates.\n Shot-A-Minute, a drinking contest to see who could down the most shots of beer without vomiting, running to the bathroom, etc. Each contestant drank one shot-glass full of beer per minute until s/he could hold no more.  These contests were held in the dining room.  The equitable and humanitarian \"one go, no blow\" rule was added to allow a contestant to use the \"new wing\" john to relieve him/herself, once, so long as s/he constantly blew a whistle from the house Risk game.  This assured that the \"no blow\" part of the rule was observed.\n The St. Patty's Day Drinkoff, a celebration of St. Patrick's Day (March 17) in the form of a drinking contest or free-for-all boozefest.\n  Les Biens, This was the name of ARU's intra-fraternity teams in the early 1970s. It was meant as a parody of Les Owls from the Psi Upsilon (Psi U) fraternity down the street.  Of course, it merely looked like it would translate from French to \"The Goods.\"\n The Green Hornet Construction Company, on-campus construction project on May 4 akin to MIT's \"hacking\" tradition. It evolved from something spontaneous to a more formal project to commemorate some key event on campus at the time. The first project in 1965 was the construction of a temple using smudge pot lanterns and the granite curb stones to be placed along Twelve Rod Road now named Park Row. As it evolved, the projects were sometimes pre-assembled in the confines of the fraternity house. In the dead of night and as silently as possible, construction took place on the Quad. At completion, the Company retreated to the fraternity house \"buzzing\" in unison. Then, with the aid of liquid refreshment, the Bill was written for submission to the Dean of the College. By agreement with the Dean circa 1969, the project could stand for one day and was disassembled by the Company during the next night. Some of the projects were:-1970, The Lake Bowdoin Recreation Facility was constructed to take advantage of the spring flooding of the quad, -1971, Piippo Hall, The first newly constructed women's dormitory named after Mrs. Piippo, the ubiquitous administrative secretary. -1973, Will Hughes Pre-Med Memorial Cemetery, to commemorate the failure of many promising freshmen in an intro science class.  The \"Green Hornet Society\" at contemporary Bowdoin continues the Green Hornet Construction Company's tradition albeit with costumed revelers and in the light of day.\n Various campus-wide parties and coffeehouses, some in conjunction with Bowdoin's annual Parents' Day, Winter's Weekend and Ivies Weekend celebrations. Parents' Weekend in particular was another occasion when the quality of ARU's bar impressed guests.\n The Hurtdance Corporation Presents, a weekly or biweekly typed recap of unusually funny or off-the-wall events, happenings, actions or quotes members said or did in the house over that one or two weeks. A \"hurtdance\" is an ultimate all-nighter in which a student attempts to complete an unusually large amount of procrastinated schoolwork in one night. The initial letters of The Hurtdance Corporation were THC, an ingredient in marijuana.\n Ralph Adolph (or Adolf), the fictitious ARU Brother whose home address was 727&1/2(?) Boylston Street, Boston.  Ralph received magazines to which the fraternity subscribed.  He also became the President of the Green Hornet Construction Company.\n Charles Paisley, another fictitious ARU Brother, named for a character in Monty Python's \"The Piranha Brothers\" sketch, whom a non-member posed as on the fraternity's 1979 composite picture. At many special dinners such as Beethoven's Birthday and Winter's Weekend, \"a toast to Charles Paisley\" was proposed.\n ARU Flyers, a derogatory nickname embraced by ARUs in the late 60's-early 70's. A flyer was defined by one brother of the era as \"one whose feet are firmly planted in mid-air.\"\n The ARU Runway, annually the tarmacked walkway across the park separating Twelve Rod Road from Maine Street that led to ARU was painted for the ARU Flyers landing benefit as they returned to the fraternity house.\n Defenestration, the act of tossing a fraternity member out of a first-floor window for unbecoming conduct of one kind or another.\n  Sock-a-Nuck's Heroes of the Week, in the early 1970s, two fraternity brothers recognized people (or things) who demonstrated valor (or not).  This evolved into a weekly Heroes List, posted every Monday by the semi-secret Heroes List Editor, naming the ten most Heroic ARU's of the previous week or weekend accompanied by the editor's summary of the outstanding exploits of each Hero.  Editorial discernment was important.  Legends were born, especially when hither-to unnoticed freshmen vaulted into stardom. \n Senior Night, an end-of-the-year banquet where the graduating members received roasts from underclassmen and gave farewell speeches. Awards presented at the banquet included: Freshman of the Year, determined by the Executive Board; Outstanding Junior, chosen by the senior class; the Kitchen Help Award, given by the Steward; the Trashmouth Award, for creativity in the use of expletives; and the Log Keeper's award, for the member mentioned the most often (some years, the least often) in Log Keeper's reports at house meetings.\n\n\"Freshmen Raid\" and \"Freshman Prank\" were designed to inculcate brotherhood among the incoming class.  The Raid required the frosh to plan a secret, middle-of-night attack to take control of the House, waking up upper-classmen by tying them in their beds or locking them in their rooms or such.  The Prank involved a trick played elsewhere on campus, and ideally would add to the reputation for zaniness that ARU enjoyed.  Stealing TD's front door and stealing all the toilet seats at the Zate house were examples.  Both houses got back their missing items, and ARU's reputation for crazy stunts was polished.\n\nARU also established a college-wide award, the James Bowdoin Cup, given annually to a distinguished scholar-athlete at the school.\n\nDissolution\nArrears with the college forced ARU's closing in 1990, which initiated the conversion of all of Bowdoin's fraternities into a system of college-owned social houses, in which entering students are assigned a \"college house\" affiliation correlating with their first-year dormitory. Each house was thus renamed after a distinguished alumnus of said fraternity. The ARU fraternity house was renamed Helmreich House after Bowdoin history and political-science professor Ernst Christian Helmreich, the faculty adviser to the Thorndike Club. His grandsons, James '81 and Alan '83, were also members.\n\nDistinguished alumni\nOther distinguished ARU alumni include author & reporter Gordon Weil '54, Judge Berle M. Schiller '65, Congressman Tom Andrews '75, noted economist Larry Lindsey '76, opera singer Kurt Ollmann '77, and science fiction writer Walter H. Hunt '81.\n\nExternal links\n Bowdoin College\n Account of the founding of Alpha Rho Upsilon by one of the founding members\n\nReferences\n\nDefunct fraternities and sororities\nFraternities and sororities in the United States\nStudent organizations established in 1946\n1946 establishments in Maine", "machine_abstract": "Founded in 1902, Alpha Phi Omega is the oldest national fraternal service organization at Dartmouth College and one of its most prominent Greek-letter organizations (GLOs).

{"id": "Parafovea", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parafovea", "title": "Parafovea", "text": "Parafovea or the parafoveal belt is a region in the retina that circumscribes the fovea and is part of the macula lutea. It is circumscribed by the perifovea.\n\nEffect on reading\nIn reading, information within 1\u00b0 (approximately 6\u20138 characters) of the point of fixation is processed in foveal vision, while information up to 6\u00b0 of visual angle benefits from parafoveal preview. Studies have shown that people can tell the difference in the letters of a word in the fovea and near-parafovea (the part of the parafovea closest to the fovea), but not in the outer edges of the parafovea. In languages that read from left to right, the word immediately to the right of the fixated word is known as the parafoveal word. Information present in the parafovea can interact with information present in the fovea. The benefit the parafoveal preview has is also mediated by how common the word in the parafovea is, with less common words providing less of a reduction in fixation duration when they reach foveal fixation. As the clarity of information in the parafovea is not as great as in the fovea, the SWIFT model of eye movements in reading, while allowing for parallel processing, accounts for this difference by assigning the parafoveal less processing power the further away it is from the foveal fixation.\n\nEffect on scene perception\nInformation in the parafovea can influence the processing of a scene. In categorization tasks of natural scenes information from the parafovea can be used to determine the gist of a scene well enough for a categorization judgement, though with reduced sensitivity and speed in comparison to foveal vision. An effect of parafoveal preview has also been found for emotional scenes presented in the parafovea, with people more likely shift their fixation point on emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli, when both options are presented parafoveally.\n\nAdditional images\n\nSee also\n Eye movement in reading\n Eye movement in music reading\n Fixation (visual)\n Optical coherence tomography (OCT)\n\nReferences\n\nHuman eye anatomy\nVisual perception", "machine_abstract": "The parafovea is the region of retina surrounding and immediately adjacent to the foveal center, which contains cones that are most sensitive to light.\nParafoveal vision refers to visual information from this area; it has lower acuity than central vision but higher resolution than peripheral vision (see Figure below ).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Parafovea\".

Bilardi's background has been described as radically different from other Western recruits and symbolises youth issues more than ideological ones.\n\nLife, radicalisation and death\nBorn in Craigieburn, Victoria, Bilardi was a shy, lonely boy and student who was reportedly bullied by peers. Bilardi kept a blog describing his disdain for United States forces committing crimes against Muslims in the Middle East. He became radical after his mother died of cancer. By 2014, he expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden on Facebook. Concerned that the Australian government was monitoring him, Bilardi turned to building explosives in the event he would not be able to leave the country. A recruiter for Jabhat al-Nusra made contact with him in August 2014 and he left for Iraq.\n\nBilardi died in a suicide attack in Ramadi, Iraq on 11 March 2015. The Iraqi Army stated Bilardi's attack was unsuccessful, killing only himself. ISIL used his death as propaganda, in order to recruit more people to become suicide bombers. According to a friend, Bilardi was concerned his family would \"spend eternity in hell\" for being non-believers.\n\nReaction\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott, commented on Bilardi's death as an \"absolutely horrific situation\", stating, \"it's very, very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking, alien and extreme ideology.\" Greg Barton, director of the Centre for Islam and the Modern World considers Bilardi a self-radical motivated by underlying mental health issues instead of religious zealotry.\n\nSee also \n 2015 Parramatta shooting\n Jihobbyist\n Terrorism in Australia\n\nReferences\n\n1996 births\n2015 suicides\n21st-century Australian criminals\nAustralian Islamists\nAustralian Sunni Muslims\nConverts to Sunni Islam\nCriminals from Melbourne\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant members from Australia\nSuicide bombers\nPeople from Melbourne\nSuicide bombings in 2015", "machine_abstract": "Jake Bilardi (born September 16, 1987) is the current head coach of the University of Maine Black Bears men's basketball team in Orono, Maine.

{"id": "Vic Harris (outfielder)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic%20Harris%20%28outfielder%29", "title": "Vic Harris (outfielder)", "text": "Elander Victor Harris (June 10, 1905 \u2013 February 23, 1978) was an American professional baseball outfielder and manager in the Negro leagues. Listed at , 168\u00a0lb., Harris batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nNicknamed \"Vicious Vic\", he was noted as one of the toughest players of his era in black baseball; Harris managed the Grays to first place in the Negro National League eight times (most for any manager in the Negro leagues) along with a Negro World Series title while being named to the East-West All Star Game seven times.\n\nCareer\nA native of Pensacola, Florida, Harris was the brother of fellow Negro leaguer Neal Harris. He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1914 and played baseball at the local YMCA. Harris started his professional career shortly after his 18th birthday, playing two games for the Pittsburgh Keystones in 1922 before moving to the Cleveland Tate Stars in 1923 and the Cleveland Browns in 1924, before start a long association with the Homestead Grays in 1925 which lasted 23 years. At this time, Homestead were not a member of any established league as the team rarely played other top black squads in those years and so statistics are limited, but when the Grays did, they often showed themselves to be a superior team.\n\nWhen Homestead joined the Eastern Colored League in 1928, Harris hit an anemic .204 average before the league folded, but he improved significantly in 1929, batting .350 in the high-offense American Negro League. In 1933 he hit .321 with Homestead, and .384 for the 1934 Pittsburgh Crawfords. The 1935 season brought Harris back to Homestead. He hit .342, as his eight home runs tied for fifth in the league and were even with Hall of Fame slugger Turkey Stearnes. A year later, he hit .315. In 1938, when Homestead dominated the league and won the first half with an .813 winning percentage, Harris led his team with a .380 batting average.\n\nHarris managed the Grays during their years in league play, between 1935 and 1948, and piloted Homestead to eight pennants. He guided his team to six consecutive first-place finishes from 1937 through 1942 (with five pennants). He took a job with a defense plant after the 1942 season, for which he would play for the Grays when he could do so while Candy Jim Taylor stepped in to manage the team for the next two seasons (each resulted in Negro World Series championships); Harris went 4-for-28 in the 1943 Negro World Series while not playing in the latter.\n\nHe also played in six East-West All-Star games between 1933 and 1947, and managed the East team eight times, four more than Oscar Charleston, the next-most-frequent manager. He won the last held Negro World Series in 1948 as the Grays left the league not long after.\n\nIn the waning days of the Negro leagues, Harris coached for the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants and managed the 1950 Birmingham Black Barons. Additionally, he played winter baseball in the Cuban League and managed Santurce in the Puerto Rican League from 1947 to 1950.\n\nAvailable statistics indicate that Harris hit .305 (733-for-2,406), and his teams posted a 547\u2013278\u20132 mark in organized league play (with undoubtedly a higher total if one takes independent play into account) and a 10\u201315 mark during post-season play. An excellent motivator, he was well liked and respected by his players.\n\nPost-career and death\nAfter post-integration, he served as coach of the 1949 Baltimore Elite Giants, he took one last managerial job with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1950 before he retired. He became the head custodian for the Castaic Union Schools in Castaic, California. He died at the age of 72 in San Fernando, California from the after-effects of surgery for treatment of cancer. He was survived by his wife Dorothy and two children in Judith and Ronald.\n\nLegacy\nHarris has the most league pennants of any manager in Negro league baseball with seven. Just five other managers in baseball history have won seven pennants. Despite this, he has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was considered in the 2006 Hall of Fame balloting, but he was not selected. On November 5, 2021, he was selected to the final ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame's Early Days Committee for consideration in the Class of 2022. He received ten of the necessary twelve votes.\n\nManagerial record\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nSources\nBiographical Dictionary of American Sports, by David L.

It is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, who donated 281 books to the library after his death in 1447. Sections of the libraries were restored and expanded in the 16th and 17th centuries, including the addition of a second storey, an east wing and a west wing. The library currently functions as an additional reading room for the Bodleian Library.\n\nHistory\n\nDuke Humfrey's Library is named after Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, a younger son of Henry IV of England. He was a connoisseur of literature and commissioned translations of classical works from Greek into Latin. When he died in 1447, he donated his collection of 281 books to the University of Oxford. At the time, this was considered an incredibly generous donation as the university only had 20 books. All classes at that time were taught via oral lectures; books were handwritten and were only for the extremely wealthy. \n\nThe library was constructed as a second storey to the Divinity School between 1450 and 1480 in order to house the donated collection. In 1550, during the Reformation, the King's Commissioners despoiled the library of books in order to destroy the vestiges of Roman Catholicism in the country. The books were probably burnt, and in 1556 the furniture was removed by the university. Today, only three of Humfrey's original books remain in the library.\n\nThe Library was refitted and restored from 1598 by Sir Thomas Bodley and between 1610 and 1612, the east wing (now the Arts End) was added. The west wing (now the Selden End) was built 20 years later. The books in the oldest part are accommodated in oak bookcases which are at right angles to the walls on either side with integral readers' desks. The ceiling consists of panels painted with the arms of the university. Up until the opening of the new Weston Library in 2015, Duke Humfrey's Library functioned as a reading room for maps, music and pre-1641 rare books; it now serves as an additional reading room for users of the Bodleian Library.\n\nCollections \nServing as an additional reading room for all users of the Bodleian, the Library consists of the original medieval section (1487), the Arts End (1612), and the Selden End (1637). It houses collections of maps, music, Western manuscripts, and theology and art materials. It is the main reading room for researchers of codicology, bibliography and local history, as well as it containing the University Archives and the Conservative Party Archive.\n\nThe Library is on the first floor and forms an H-shape with the later parts as the uprights. The Arts End is above the Proscholium and is attached at two corners to the Old Schools Quadrangle. The medieval section is above the Divinity School and Selden End (named after John Selden a benefactor of the library) is above the Convocation House. \n\nA drawing of the medieval section with the Divinity School below in isolation is used as the emblem of the Bodleian Library. \n\nDuke Humfrey's Library was used as the Hogwarts Library in the Harry Potter films.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nBodleian Library", "machine_abstract": "The Duke Humfrey\u2019s Library is the oldest surviving library in Oxford, England and was founded by William Marshal (died 1219), 1st Earl of Pembroke as part of his college at New College, Oxford.

With partner Pascal Lavanchy, she is a two-time World medalist (1994 silver, 1995 bronze) and two-time European medalist (1995 silver, 1997 bronze).\n\nSkating career \nMoniotte/Lavanchy began competing internationally in the 1980s. In 1992, they competed at their first Winter Olympics, finishing ninth at the event in Albertville, France. \n\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, Moniotte/Lavanchy stood atop the podium at the 1993 Skate America and 1993 Skate Canada International. They placed fifth at the 1994 European Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark and at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. They were awarded silver at the final event of the season, the 1994 World Championships in Chiba, Japan.\n\nIn 1994\u201395, Moniotte/Lavanchy won the 1994 NHK Trophy and their third consecutive national title. The duo then won silver at the 1995 European Championships in Dortmund, Germany and bronze at the 1995 World Championships in Birmingham, England.\n\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, Moniotte/Lavanchy were invited to compete at two events of the inaugural Champions Series (Grand Prix), the 1995 Skate America and 1995 Nations Cup. They withdrew due to injury. On 19 October 1995, Moniotte fractured the lateral malleolus of her left ankle while training at the Colombes rink. Although she resumed training in January 1996, she had not recovered and the duo ultimately decided to withdraw from the 1996 World Championships. \n\nMoniotte/Lavanchy returned to competition in the 1996\u201397 season. In October 1996, they finished second to Marina Anissina / Gwendal Peizerat at the French Championships, having placed first in the compulsory and original dances and second in the free dance. Despite the loss of their national title, they edged out Anissina/Peizerat for the bronze medal at the 1997 European Championships in Paris, France. Moniotte/Lavanchy then placed fourth at the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, again finishing as the top French team.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, Moniotte/Lavanchy once again lost to Anissina/Peizerat at the French Championships and then slipped behind internationally, placing seventh at the 1998 European Championships in Milan, Italy. Moniotte/Lavanchy became three-time Olympians at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. They placed 11th and then retired from competition.

Thompson of Illinois from 1977 to 1984.\n\nFederal judicial service\nOn June 19, 1984, President Ronald Reagan nominated Rovner to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated by Judge Joel Flaum. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 12, 1984, and received commission the same day. Her service was terminated on August 17, 1992, due to elevation to the Seventh Circuit.\n\nOn July 2, 1992, President George H. W. Bush nominated Rovner to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated by Judge Harlington Wood Jr. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 12, 1992, and received commission on August 17, 1992.\n\nNotable cases\nOn April 20, 2018, Rovner ruled against Trump's policy punishing sanctuary cities. She said allowing federal agencies to add conditions to grant funds without explicit congressional authority could lead to \"tyranny.\" Rovner wrote, \"The Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds. It falls to us, the judiciary, as the remaining branch of the government, to act as a check on such usurpation of power.\"\n\nRovner was joined by William J. Bauer upholding the nationwide injunction against the policy. Daniel Anthony Manion partially dissented, saying he would narrow the injunction to protect only Chicago.\n\nOn August 27, 2019, Rovner joined David Hamilton in blocking Indiana's parental notification requirement for abortions. Michael Kanne dissented. On November 1, 2019, the 7th circuit denied en banc by a vote of 6\u20135, with Rovner in the majority. Frank Easterbrook, who provided a decisive vote, called on the Supreme Court to hear the case. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ordered a re-hearing in the case.\n\nReferences\n\n1938 births\n20th-century American judges\nAlumni of King's College London\nAmerican women judges\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nBryn Mawr College alumni\nIllinois Institute of Technology alumni\nIllinois lawyers\nIllinois Republicans\nJudges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\nJudges of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois\nLatvian emigrants to the United States\nLatvian World War II refugees\nLatvian Jews\nLiving people\nPoliticians from Chicago\nUnited States court of appeals judges appointed by George H.

{"id": "Henning Alexander von Kleist", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning%20Alexander%20von%20Kleist", "title": "Henning Alexander von Kleist", "text": "Henning Alexander von Kleist (1676/77\u20131749) was an 18th-century Prussian field marshal. He fought in the War of Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War, and in the Wars of Austrian Succession.  In particular, his actions at the Battle of Mollwitz brought him acclaim, although he had long been a stalwart supporter of Prussian military developments by the Prussian kings Frederick (1740\u20131786) and Frederick William I (1713\u20131740).\n\nFamily\nKleist belonged to an old Pomeranian family that stemmed from the year 1175, and the family served the Duke Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania in his wars. In the 14th century, the family divided into three lines, from three brothers.  The oldest line was the Dubberow-Tuchow line; the Muttrin-Damen line was second, and the third was Bilnow-Raddatz, which ended in 1784.  In total, the Kleist line produced more than 19 generals, and an assortment of poets, inventors, scientists, and philosophers.\n\nHenning Alexander von Kleist was born on 4 May in 1676 or 1677 in Raddatz in Pomerania. He was the third son of Joachim Daniel von Kleist. and his first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel.\n\nHis father married three times.  The first wife, Maria Catherine von Ramel, 18 May 1644, 1672 married, and died 3 January 1685.  She was the second daughter of Heinrich von Ramel and Else Sophia von M\u00fcnchow, from Bulgrin.  She bore four sons, and one daughter:\nJ\u00fcrgen (died before 1688)\nPhilipp Heinrich. Initially served in Prussian military, but after a duel, left Prussia and settled in Brussels.  There he married Antonia Catharine van der Linden on 26 February 1704.  He entered French service as a lieutenant in the Regiment de la Mare, fought in the War of Spanish Succession and died on 10 September 1709, in the Battle of Malplaquet.  He had one son, Ludwig, who died on 18 May 1780, without legitimate descendants.\nHenning Alexander (1676\u20131747)\nMaria Catherine 10 February 1677, 23 May 1701 married J\u00fcrgen Heinrich von Kleist (of Raddtz), 27 February 1753 (in Juchow).\nRichard Christian, called himself Richard; served in the military, Infantry Regiment Borck (No 33z)., By 7 May 1714, he was Major, 24 July\u20134 August 1718, stationed in Colberg as commander.  22 October 1718, Lt Colonel with the Infantry Regiment Mosel. Died in Wesel 1723.\nLeopold, died without male issue.\nBalthazar Gustav 16 April 1689\u20138 April 1694.\n\nMilitary service\n\nKleist served in the Prussian military during the reigns of three kings: Frederick I, Frederick William I, and Frederick the Great. He joined the Prussian military in the Alt-Anhalt Regiment in 1698 or 1699, and saw active service continuously from the War of Spanish Succession, which began in 1701, until the Peace of Utrecht in 1713: he served in campaigns in the Netherlands, France and the Italian states under the command of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, known as the Old Dessauer (der alte Dessauer). Consequently, he learned the military craft under the leadership of one of the foremost infantry commanders of the age. He fought at the memorable Battle of Blenheim in 1704 in the wing commanded by Prince Eugene of Savoy. During the 1704 campaign, he also saw action under the leadership of the legendary T\u00fcrken-Louis.  After the victories in southern Germany, his regiment went to northern Italy, where it participated in the fighting of Cassano in 1705.  He also helped to break the siege at Turin in 1706, as part of the relief column that attacked the French army. Subsequently, he served in the Great Northern War (1705\u20131721), and participated in the lengthy Siege of Stralsund (1711\u201315). He acquired the patent as Chief (Inhaber) of his regiment in 1718, which he held until retirement in 1723.\n\nIn 1726 he was recalled to service by Frederick William I. In 1730 he acquired the patent as proprietor of the Old Prussian Infantry Regiment, which, in 1806 became regiment No. 26.  He held that patent until his death in 1749. During the decade of the 1730s, he was in regular communication with the then-Prince Frederick, and became one of his trusted commanders.\n\nDuring the War of Austrian Succession, in 1741 as a lieutenant general he commanded the city Kolberg. As a participant in the Battle of Mollwitz, his infantry regiment not only held its line despite the flight of the Prussian cavalry, but subsequently attacked the Austrian line with such ferocity that he and his soldiers received special mention in Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin's report. He was wounded in the fighting. The regiment's actions here reflected the iron training imposed by the prince of Anhalt Dessau on his subordinates, and their subsequent training of their own regiments.  In addition, the Prussian infantry benefited not only from the discipline of drill but also the latest in military technology; unlike their Austrian counterparts, they had iron ramrods which allowed them to fire faster and more accurately. After the battle, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle on 15 April 1741, and later awarded the Order Pour le M\u00e9rite. During the Silesian Wars, in 1744 he acquired as war booty the gold-plated carriage originally belonging to Jan Sobieski; Kleist gave the carriage to his local church.\n\nIn 1745 Kleist was promoted to General of Infantry and two years later, in 1747, to field marshal, at the conclusion of a grand troop revue. He was promoted at the same time as Count Friedrich Ludwig, Graf zu Dohna-Carwinden, von Kalckstein (Frederick's educator and lifelong Councillor), Joachim Christof von Jeetze and Dietrich of Anhalt-Dessau. He became ill in 1749; von Kleist died on 22 August, at age of 73.\n\nDescendants\nKleist married Albertine Marie von Biedersee, daughter of Georg Burchardt of Biedersee from Ilberst\u00e4dt, who died on 23 June 1731 in Rindbett. She bore him seven sons and three daughters.\nNicholas Valentine, died as a child.\nCharlotte Louisa, married Conrad von der Golz\nFriedrich Wilhelm, born c January 1718. but this child also died young.\nLeopold, born 29 January 1719 in Hall. He entered military service in the Munchow regiment (later regiment No. 36) on 7 September 1738, and was promoted to first lieutenant on 6 August 1741. He attained the rank of colonel, and died in 1787 in Neuenhagen bei C\u00f6slin. \nWilhelmine Philippine, born 1720, 1745 married War and Land Minister Georg Ernst\nHelene Albertine Christiane, born 1722, in 174 married the Colonel of the Watch Casimir Ernst von Schmeling.\nFriedrich Albrecht Christian.  21 December 1723\u201311 March 1724\nWilhelm Alexander 1724\u201319 February 1725.\nAlexander Ludwig 25 October 1725\u201320 May 1751. \nWilhelm Christoph,  1 August 1727.  As a 19-year-old, he entered the Holy Orders of the Knights of St. John.  In 1749, he volunteered as a freicorporal in the Regiment of Major General Haut Charmon,  known on 8 June the following year as Gefreiter Corporal Wilhelm Christoph.  He eventually inherited the family properties of Raddatz line. He purchased a position as an ensign in 1755.  In the Seven Years' War he was a captain of the Pomeranian battalion Stosch,  and served from 1760\u20131762.  He y advanced to the position of major before he left military service.  In 1768 he lived in Dutzerow, a property he purchased. He married three times.  One wife bore him son, but died in 1760 with the boy. The male Raddatzline ended in 1793, with his death.\n\nOther family\nHis nephew, also named Henning Alexander von Kleist, the son of his sister Maria Katharine (married Johan Daniel von Kleist), also served in the Prussian military (1724\u2013?.)\n\nNotes and citations\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nLiterature\n K\u00f6nig, Anton Balthasar, Henning Alexander von Kleist, Biographisches Lexikon aller Helden und Milit\u00e4rpersonen: T.

{"id": "Anna Swanwick", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%20Swanwick", "title": "Anna Swanwick", "text": "Anna Swanwick (22 June 1813 \u2013 2 November 1899) was an English author and feminist.\n\nLife\nAnna Swanwick was the youngest daughter of John Swanwick and his wife, Hannah Hilditch. She was born in Liverpool on 22 June 1813.  The Swanwicks descended from Philip Henry, the 17th century nonconformist divine. Anna was educated chiefly at home, but, wishing to carry on her education beyond the typical age for girls in this country at that time, she went in 1839 to Berlin, where she studied German and Greek, and gained knowledge of Hebrew.\n\nShe returned to England in 1843 and began translating some of the German dramatists. Her first publication, Selections from the Dramas of Goethe and Schiller appeared in 1843. The selections included Goethe's Torquato Tasso and Iphigenia in Tauris, and Schiller's Maid of Orleans.  In 1850, she released a volume of translations from Goethe containing the first part of Faust, Egmont, and the two plays of the former volume. The translations are in blank verse.  In 1878, she published the second part of Faust; the two parts with Moritz Retzsch's illustrations appeared together in one volume the same year.  Miss Swanwick's Faust passed through many editions and was included in Bohn's series of translations from foreign classics. Her English version is accurate and spirited, and is regarded as one of the best in existence.\n \nAbout 1850, Bunsen advised her to try her hand at translating from the Greek, with the result that in 1865 she published a blank-verse translation of the Trilogy of Aeschylus, and in 1873 of the whole of his dramas. The choruses are in rhymed metres. Her translation has passed through many editions and ranks high among English versions. It keeps fairly close to the original.\n \nMiss Swanwick did not confine herself to literary work. She took a keen interest in many social issues of the day, especially women's education, and in raising the moral and intellectual tone of the working classes. She was a member of the councils both of Queen's College and Bedford College, London, and was for some time president of the latter.\n\nShe assisted in the founding of Girton College, Cambridge, and Somerville Hall, Oxford, and in extending the King's College lectures to women. To all these institutions she subscribed liberally. She was associated with Anthony John Mundella and Sir Joshua Girling Fitch in carrying out the provisions of the will of Mrs. Emily Jane Pfeiffer, who left in 1890 large sums of money for the promotion of the higher education of women. She strongly advocated the study of English literature in the universities, and herself lectured privately on the subject to young working men and women.\n \nMiss Swanwick's life was thus divided between literary pursuits and active philanthropy. She never sought publicity, but her example and influence had an important and invigorating effect on women's education and on their position in the community. She signed John Stuart Mill's petition to parliament in 1865 for the political enfranchisement of women. The University of Aberdeen conferred on her the honorary degree of LL.D. She was a Unitarian. Miss Swanwick was the centre of a large circle of distinguished friends, who included Crabb Robinson, Tennyson, Browning, Gladstone, James Martineau, and Sir James Paget, and these, with many others, were frequent visitors at her house. Her marvellous memory made her a delightful talker, and she was full of anecdotes in her later years about the eminent persons she had known.\n \nShe died on 2 Nov. 1899 at Tunbridge Wells, and was buried in the Swanwick family plot on the western side of Highgate Cemetery five days later.\n\nHer name appears on the south side of the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n\nSources\n Mary L.

{"id": "Duke Nukem (character)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke%20Nukem%20%28character%29", "title": "Duke Nukem (character)", "text": "Duke Nukem is a fictional character and protagonist of the Duke Nukem series of video games. The character first appeared in the 1991 video game Duke Nukem, developed by Apogee Software. He has since starred in multiple sequels developed by 3D Realms. Most recently, he starred in Duke Nukem Forever, released by Gearbox Software, which now owns the rights and intellectual property.\n\nThe character was created by Todd Replogle, George Broussard, and Scott Miller of Apogee Software. Duke Nukem was redesigned as the present tough guy incarnation by George Broussard and Allen Blum for the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D. A sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, was released in 2011, after remaining in development since 1997.\n\nPersonality and appearance\nIn the original game, Duke Nukem barely spoke and was portrayed as a disgruntled TV viewer hired by the CIA to save Earth from the mad scientist Dr. Proton, whom he took offense to for interrupting his soap opera. In the second game, he began to evolve into a more traditional action hero, but remained mostly silent. Since the third game, Duke's personality has been that of a confident, aggressive, politically incorrect, wise-cracking, hyper-masculine person. Although not superhuman, Duke manages to achieve incredible physical feats of violence and conquest through sheer machismo and expertise with automatic firearms. In Duke Nukem Forever, his massive ego is somehow capable of functioning like a shield from physical damage.\n\nHis missions generally involve killing aliens that have invaded Earth. He is apparently sexually adept and irresistible to females, and circumstances often find him surrounded by many buxom women. However, he frequently mentions an estranged love interest named \"Lani\", and she becomes the basis for many of his jokes. This is widely believed to be a reference to Lani Minella, a voice actress who did several voices for Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nDuke Nukem's current character is a pastiche of a number of Hollywood action heroes, including Dirty Harry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and John Wayne. Many of his lines are taken from the movie Army of Darkness, and his most famous line is from the movie They Live with Roddy Piper saying, \"I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum.\" Duke's appearance resembles that of The Boz as well as characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Voiced by Jon St. John since the third game, Duke's voice is based on that of Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry.\n\nDuke is best known for his trademark jet pack, his golden IMI Desert Eagle pistol or golden Colt M1911, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, which completely conceal his eyes and which he has been seen wearing even at night since Duke Nukem 3D. His other trademark is a blond military-style flattop haircut which has existed since the first game, and the radioactive trefoil symbol, which is found on his belt-buckle, the side of his signature pistol, and numerous other locations throughout the games.  He usually wears a red tank top (pink in the first game), military tactical harness, blue jeans and black army boots - in some of the games, Duke executes a maneuver known as the \"Mighty Boot,\" which is simply a strong front kick. He is also notable for constantly smoking a cigar.\n\nIn Duke Nukem II, Duke wrote an autobiography titled Why I'm So Great which he later autographed in Duke Nukem Forever. In Duke Nukem Forever, he's achieved immense fame and fortune since saving the Earth, now owning a casino on the Las Vegas Strip called The Ladykiller, in which the Damn! ... It's Late Show (hosted by Johnny O'Lenoman) is taped, and the Museum of Duke is housed, as well as a burger restaurant chain called Duke Burger. He is also linked to the EDF (Earth Defense Forces), answering to General Graves. In a news conference held at the end of Duke Nukem Forever, he announces his intention of running for president, which would make him the 69th U.S. president.\n\nAccording to the stats provided by the Duke Nukem Character Memory Card, he is 6'4\" (1,93 m) and at a body fat percentage of 8%, weighs 240\u00a0lbs. (109\u00a0kg).\n\nAppearances\nDuke Nukem was initially created in 1987 by chief programmer Todd Replogle of Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) as the protagonist for the video game he was designing titled Metal Future, which was set in the then-near future of \"one decade later from now\" in 1997. After hearing the character's name, producer and founder of Apogee, Scott Miller, suggested the game should have the same name, and he helped design the character. Artwork was produced by George Broussard, Allen H. Blum III, and Jim Norwood. Duke was not voiced, but spoke through on-screen text.\n\nIn the sequel, Duke Nukem II, which was released two years later, the same mostly-silent incarnation of the character was used, although he was now an American hero. Duke Nukem II features an intro with one line, spoken by Joe Siegler (\"I'm back\"), and a death scream by character co-creator Todd Replogle.\n\nFor Duke Nukem 3D, the character of Duke Nukem was dramatically redesigned by George Broussard and Allen Blum as the more familiar macho, wise-cracking character of today. Duke Nukem 3D was one of the most controversial games at the time due to its strong violence, cultural stereotypes, strong language, and sexual content. Duke Nukem 3D, as well as the dozen or so subsequent Duke Nukem games, feature Jon St. John as the voice of Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem 3D was the first game in which the character has a significant speaking role.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that John Cena will star in a Duke Nukem movie for Paramount Pictures & Platinum Dunes. However, in January 2019, Duke Nukem voice actor Jon St. John stated that no movie was in development. In a press statement announcing Embracer Group's acquisition of Gearbox Software, however, production of the film was reconfirmed.\n\nGames with Duke Nukem as a protagonist\n Duke Nukem (temporarily \"Duke Nukum\") \u2013 1991 \u2013 MS-DOS\n Duke Nukem II \u2013 1993 \u2013 MS-DOS, iPhone/iPod Touch, iPad\n Duke Nukem 3D \u2013 1996 \u2013 MS-DOS, Mac OS, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive, Game.com, Xbox Live Arcade, iPhone/iPod Touch, Nokia N900, Source ports, Android, iPad\n Duke Nukem 64 \u2013 1997 \u2013 Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown \u2013 1997 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Time to Kill \u2013 1998 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Zero Hour \u2013 1998 \u2013 Nintendo 64\n Duke Nukem \u2013 1999 \u2013 Game Boy Color\n Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes (temporarily \"Planet of the Babes\") \u2013 2000 \u2013 PlayStation\n Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project \u2013 2002 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Xbox Live Arcade\n Duke Nukem Advance \u2013 2002 \u2013 Game Boy Advance\n Duke Nukem Mobile \u2013 2004 \u2013 Tapwave Zodiac\n Duke Nukem Mobile - 2004 - Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project \u2013 2005 \u2013 Cellular phones\n Duke Nukem Mobile 3D \u2013 2005 \u2013 Cellular phones (updated port of the original Zodiac version with enhanced graphics)\n Duke Nukem Arena - 2007 - Cellular phones (updated port of Duke Nukem Mobile 3D that included an arena-style multiplayer)\n Duke Nukem: Critical Mass \u2013 2011 - Nintendo DS\n Duke Nukem Forever \u2013 2011 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\n Duke Nukem 3D: World Tour \u2013 2016 \u2013 Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch\n\nOther appearances\n Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure - 1992 - MS-DOS\n Death Rally - 1996 - MS-DOS\n Balls of Steel - 1997 - Microsoft Windows\n Blood - 1997 - MS-DOS\n Serious Sam 2 - 2005 - Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox\n Death Rally - 2011 - Microsoft Windows, iOS\n Choplifter HD - 2012 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition - 2017 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n Rad Rodgers: Radical Edition - 2018 - Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\n Wild Buster: Heroes of Titan - 2018 - Microsoft Windows\n Ready Player One - 2018 - Film\n Duke Nukem - TBA - Film\n\nReception\nDuke Nukem has been listed on many \"Best Characters\" and \"Best Heroes\" lists over the years, including being listed as number one in ScrewAttack's \"Top 10 Coolest Video Game Characters\" list in 2007. Featuring him in the section \"top ten forces of good\" in their 2004 list of top 50 retro game heroes, Retro Gamer called Duke \"the ultimate cheese hero, and a true remnant of 80\u2019s action flicks.\" He was listed at number 27 in the \"Top 50 Video Game Characters\" list by Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2011. GameDaily also ranked him sixth on their list of best anti-heroes in video games. In 2011, Empire ranked him as the 20th greatest video game character, calling him \"one of the best action characters ever devised\" and adding that \"Film might have Schwarzenegger, but Gaming's got Mr Nukem\".\n\nReception of the character by the time of Duke Nukem Forever's release was mostly mixed. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer elaborated on Duke Nukem's decreased relevance since 1996, and added that the character's \"half-hearted digs\" at rival franchises were ill-advised due to the game's datedness. Charles Onyett of IGN likened Duke Nukem's maturity to a \"12-year-old boy with Internet access\" and expressed disappointment in the character's datedness and the missed opportunity on the developers' part to \"[play] with the idea of Duke as an anachronism\". Ryan Winterhalter of 1UP.com noted that Duke Nukem had become \"a caricature of his former self. He's crossed the line from charmingly foul-mouthed to obnoxious and embarrassing.\" Cian Hassett of PALGN was more positive about the character, finding him to be \"genuinely hilarious\" due to his tongue-in-cheek rejection of video game traditions (such as finding a key to open a door or wearing a special suit of armor).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAction-adventure game characters\nDuke Nukem\nFictional alcohol abusers\nFictional American people in video games\nFictional cannabis users\nFictional characters from California\nFictional gamblers\nFictional super soldiers\nFictional mercenaries in video games\nFictional smokers\nFirst-person shooter characters\nMale characters in video games\nVideo game characters introduced in 1991\nVideo game characters with accelerated healing\nVideo game mascots\nVideo game protagonists", "machine_abstract": "Duke Nukem: The World's Greatest Athlete Duke Nukem is the protagonist of several video games, including first-person shooter and platformer titles developed by 3D Realms and published under their own label as well as other publishers such as Interplay Entertainment Group Inc., Sierra Entertainment Corporation, Take-Two Interactive Software, Apogee Software International Ltd.

{"id": "Jurisdiction stripping", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction%20stripping", "title": "Jurisdiction stripping", "text": "In United States law, jurisdiction-stripping (also called court-stripping or curtailment-of-jurisdiction), is the limiting or reducing of a court's jurisdiction by Congress through its constitutional authority to determine the jurisdiction of federal and state courts.\n\nBasis\nCongress may define the jurisdiction of the judiciary through the simultaneous use of two powers. First, Congress holds the power to create (and, implicitly, to define the jurisdiction of) federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court (i.e. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and various other Article I and Article III tribunals).  This court-creating power is granted both in the congressional powers clause (Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 9) and in the judicial vesting clause (Art. III, \u00a7 1). Second, Congress has the power to make exceptions to and regulations of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  This court-limiting power is granted in the Exceptions Clause (Art. III, \u00a7 2).  By exercising these powers in concert, Congress may effectively eliminate any judicial review of certain federal legislative or executive actions and of certain state actions, or alternatively transfer the judicial review responsibility to state courts by \"knocking [federal courts] ... out of the game.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton had this to say about the issue in The Federalist:\n\nFrom this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the system.  If some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences.\n\nTransfer of authority to state judiciaries\nFramers of the Constitution, such as Roger Sherman of Connecticut, did not envision jurisdiction stripping as invariably insulating a law from judicial review, and instead foresaw that state judiciaries could determine compatibility of certain types of state statutes with federal laws and the federal Constitution.  In 1788, Sherman publicly explained that,\n\nIt was thought necessary in order to carry into effect the laws of the Union, to promote justice, and preserve harmony among the states, to extend the judicial powers of the United States to the enumerated cases, under such regulations and with such exceptions as shall be provided by law, which will doubtless reduce them to cases of such magnitude and importance as cannot be safely trusted to the final decisions of the courts of particular states; and the constitution does not make it necessary that any inferior tribunals should be instituted, but it may be done if found necessary; 'tis probable that courts of particular states will be authorized by the laws of the union, as has heretofore been done in cases of piracy, &c. ...\n\nThus, there are two kinds of jurisdiction-stripping: one which changes the court that will hear the case (as Sherman envisioned), versus one which essentially insulates statutes from judicial review altogether.  Jurisdiction-stripping statutes usually take away no substantive rights but rather change the court that will hear the case.\n\nCongress has sometimes limited federal involvement in state cases, for example by setting a minimum amount in controversy in order to bar the lower federal courts from hearing diversity cases that involve less than that amount (currently $75,000), combined with precluding a right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Likewise, Congress has never required that state court cases involving federal questions be removed or appealed to federal court, and so the federal courts are unable to exercise power in many of those cases.\n\nLimits\nCongress may not strip the U.S. Supreme Court of jurisdiction over those cases that fall under the Court's original jurisdiction defined in the U.S. Constitution. Congress can limit only the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in, \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party. ... \"  This last state-shall-be-a-party language has not been interpreted by the Court as meaning that it has original jurisdiction merely because a state is a plaintiff or defendant, even if a provision of the U.S. Constitution is at issue. Rather, the Court has started that the controversy must be between two or more states, or between a state and citizens of another state, or between a state and foreigners.  Additionally, in 1892, the Court decided that it has original jurisdiction in cases between a state and the United States.\n\nStory's theory\nJustice Joseph Story, in his opinion in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee and in his other writings, wrote extensively about how Congress should ensure that the judicial power is properly vested in the federal courts.  Professor Akhil Amar credits Story with the theory that Congress may not concurrently remove the jurisdiction of inferior courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over certain categories of claims, as doing so would violate the Constitution's mandatory grant of jurisdiction over such claims to the judiciary as a whole.  Story wrote in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee:\n\nThe judicial power shall extend to all the cases enumerated in the constitution.   As the mode is not limited, it may extend to all such cases, in any form, in which judicial power may be exercised.  It may, therefore, extend to them in the shape of original or appellate jurisdiction, or both; for there is nothing in the nature of the cases which binds to the exercise of the one in preference to the other.\n\nAccording to Amar, Story's exposition of federal court jurisdiction \"has generated considerable confusion\" and furthermore, as Amar understands Story's theory, it \"simply cannot be right\".  Professor Henry M. Hart instead argued that Congress may strip the power of the federal judiciary to hear certain classes of cases. Hart wrote: \"In the scheme of the Constitution [state courts] are the primary guarantors of constitutional rights, and in many cases they may be the ultimate ones.\"\n\nCalabresi's theory\nIn 2007, law professors Steven Calabresi and Gary Lawson opined that Congress can strip the U.S. Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction only to the extent that Congress expands the Court's original jurisdiction.  Calabresi and Lawson acknowledged that their theory contradicts the holding of Marbury v. Madison, according to which the Constitution's description of the Court's original jurisdiction is exhaustive.\n\nAccording to Calabresi and Lawson, Congress has no ability to alter or make exceptions to the judicial power of the United States, or to do anything less than bring the full judicial power into execution.  The Calabresi theory finds support in a 2010 article by Washburn University Law Professor Alex Glashausser.  On the other hand, Judge William A. Fletcher wrote an article in 2010 taking the opposite point of view.\n\nRelated issues\nGenerally speaking, the word \"power\" is not necessarily synonymous with the word \"jurisdiction\".  For instance, courts will often assert a modest degree of power over a case for purposes of determining whether it has jurisdiction, or for purposes of receiving jurisdiction.\n\nThe Constitution vests the judicial power \"in one supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time establish\" (emphasis added).  Scholars have debated whether the word \"in\" means that the entire judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and is also vested entirely in the inferior courts; that possibility has implications for what the vesting of such power means.\n\nOther relevant Supreme Court cases\nDuring Reconstruction, Congress withdrew jurisdiction from a case the U.S. Supreme Court was then in the process of adjudicating.  In terminating the case Ex Parte McCardle, 74 US 506 (1869), the Justices acknowledged the authority of Congress to intervene.\n\nWe are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature.  We can only examine into its power under the Constitution; and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words. ... It is quite clear, therefore, that this court cannot proceed to pronounce judgment in this case, for it has no longer jurisdiction of the appeal; and judicial duty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws confer.\n\nIn 1882, the Supreme Court again conceded that its own \"actual jurisdiction is confined within such limits as Congress sees fit to describe.\"\n\nIn 1948, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter conceded in a dissenting opinion that \"Congress need not give this Court any appellate power; it may withdraw appellate jurisdiction once conferred.\"\n\nIn 1972, Chief Justice Warren Burger made it known, concurring with the denial of certiorari to Volpe v. D. C. Federation of Civic Associations, that he believed Congress could do anything in its power to make its intentions clear, \"even to the point of limiting or prohibiting judicial review of its directives in this respect.\" This was recorded in reference to a particular dispute with a court of appeal, which he accused of \"unjustifiably frustrat[ing] the efforts of the Executive Branch to comply with the will of Congress.\" However, 10 days earlier, President Nixon had made a statement indicating his opposition to school busing for racial integration. In that context, Burger's statement was interpreted at the time as suggesting that Congress prohibit busing with legislation and enforce that legislation with jurisdiction stripping.\n\nFurther federal statutes\nMore recent examples of jurisdiction stripping include the following:\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (inter alia, stripped the federal judiciary of its jurisdiction to review certain Immigration and Naturalization Service decisions),\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (restricting the remedies available to prison inmates),\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (limiting the number of habeas corpus petitions available to prison inmates),\nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, ruled as unconstitutional denial of the right of habeas corpus pursuant to the Suspension clause in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006).\nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006 (Strip all Federal Courts of the U.S. jurisdiction to hear appeal or cases from Guantanamo Bay Detainee) Ruled Unconstitutional in the case of Boumediene v.

He also served as Duke of Cieszyn.\n\nBorn in Vienna on 8 September 1633, and baptised as Ferdinand Franz,  Ferdinand IV was the eldest son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. At a young age, Ferdinand IV took his father's role as Archduke of Austria. In 1646, Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia as he shared the role with his father Emperor Ferdinand III. He was crowned on 5 August 1646, and also shared the role of Duke of Cieszyn with Ferdinand III. Ferdinand IV also shared the role as King of Hungary and Croatia with his father; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg, present-day Slovakia.\n\nAfter the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans, Emperor Ferdinand III made an opportunity of a recent decline in the prestige of France, and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans, and de facto heir to the Holy Roman Empire. He was crowned in Ratisbon (Regensburg, present-day south-east Germany) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653. However, Ferdinand IV unexpectedly died of smallpox in Vienna on 9 July 1654, and was later succeeded by his brother Leopold I as King of the Romans. Prior to his death, it was planned that he would marry Philip IV of Spain's daughter Maria Theresa of Spain, his cousin. Upon the death of Ferdinand III, Leopold I was elected as Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nAncestors\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1633 births\n1654 deaths\n17th-century Kings of the Romans\nHabsburg kings of Bohemia\nKings of Hungary\nDukes of Teschen\nKnights of the Golden Fleece\nNobility from Vienna\nDeaths from smallpox\nBurials at the Imperial Crypt\n17th-century House of Habsburg\nHeirs apparent who never acceded", "machine_abstract": "Ferdinand IV (Italian: Fernando; German: Ferdinand) (6 May 1673 \u2013 10 September 1726) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1700 to his death in 1726 and Duke of Milan from 1701 until he renounced it on 24 February 1714.\nHe was born at Monza as the son of Charles II by Maria Theresa of Spain.

His parents were Matthew Robinson (1694\u20131778) of Edgely and West Layton, Yorkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Drake of Cambridge; his sisters included the novelists Elizabeth Montagu and Sarah Scott. Of his six brothers, Thomas the second was known as a legal writer, William the fifth as a cleric, and the youngest, Charles, as a Member of Parliament. His father inherited property in the neighbourhood of Rokeby from his great-uncle Matthew Robinson, rector of Burneston; and his mother inherited the Mount Morris estate at Monks Horton, near Hythe, Kent, from her brother Morris Drake Morris, which Rokeby in turn succeeded to in 1746.\n\nRobinson was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1730, and to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1731. He became a Fellow there in 1734. In 1746 his mother died and he inherited her Monks Horton property. As a consequence, he then assumed the additional name of Morris.\n\nIn November 1746 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society citation reads: Mathew Robinson Esqr, A Gentleman well versed in Philosophical Learning, and polite Literature; being desirous of becoming a fellow of this Society, We on our personal knowledge do recommend him as every way qualified and likely to become a usefull Member of our Body. His proposers were Edw Montagu (brother-in-law); Daniel Wray; Geo Lewis Scott (brother-in-law); Henry Baker; Robt Smith; M Folkes.\n\nHe was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the Bedford Level Corporation in 1756, a position he held until 1763.\n\nRobinson-Morris represented Canterbury in Parliament, from 1747 to 1761; in politics he was a Whig. He inherited the title Lord Rokeby in 1794 after the death of his father's second  cousin, The 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh.\n\nSupposed eccentric\n\nThe 2nd Lord Rokeby became an enthusiastic supporter of baths during a holiday in the spa town of Aix-la-Chapelle. When he returned to Kent, he began to make daily trips to the seashore to swim in salt water regardless of the weather. He preferred this environment to such an extent that his servant had to persuade him to come home. Sometimes he fainted and had to be rescued. He had a hut built for him on the sands at Hythe and drinking fountains along his route to the beach. He walked all the way and let his servant follow him in the carriage with full livery. If he found people drinking from a fountain, he gave them a half-crown coin.\n\nHe also let his beard grow, which was against the contemporary fashion. Eventually it was so thick that it stuck out under his arms and could be seen from behind.  In a couple of years he decided to build a swimming pool in his mansion - it was built under glass and was heated by sun. There he spent hours at the time, preferably alone. He refused to have a fire in his house even in the coldest weather.\n\nHis increased isolation bred rumours, including one that he was a cannibal or ate only raw meat - when he ate mainly beef tea and nibbled at venison. He also refused to see any doctors. As for church service, he claimed that God was best worshipped at natural altars of the earth, the sea and the sky - not to mention that the sermons were boring.\n\nWhen Lord Rokeby did indeed agree to accept visitors, he might \"entertain\" them with lengthy, boring poems. He arranged a sumptuous meal for Prince William of Gloucester but ate very little himself. He very rarely visited the court and then was an embarrassment to his socialite sister, Elizabeth Montagu. When he stayed at the Chequers Inn at Lenham in 1796 so he could vote in the general election, curious locals took him for a Turk.\n\nIn January 1755 Mrs. Montagu wrote to their sister, Sarah Scott:\n'Brother Robinson is emulating the great Diogenes and other ... doctors of the stoic fur; he flies the life of London and leads a life of such privacy and seriousness as looks to the beholder like wisdom', and in 1756 she reported that he now lived upon almost raw meat, never touched bread, considering corn exotic, and for the same reason substituted honey for sugar.\n\nDeath\nLord Rokeby died in December 1800, peacefully in his bed.  His title and estates passed to his nephew Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby. His tomb in Armagh Cathedral is sculpted by John Bacon.\n\nReferences\n\nEdith Sitwell, English Eccentrics: A gallery of weird and wonderful men and women, Harmondsworth: Penguin (1983), pp.\u00a047\u201355.\n\nAttribution\n\n.\n\n1712 births\n1800 deaths\nBarons in the Peerage of Ireland\nFellows of Trinity Hall, Cambridge\nMembers of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies\nBritish MPs 1747\u20131754\nBritish MPs 1754\u20131761\nFellows of the Royal Society", "machine_abstract": "Matthew Henry \"Robinson\" (born 21 May 1943) is the second son of Sir Matthew Robinson and his wife Lady Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\"; he was born in London but grew up at their family home near Wolverhampton where they lived until moving to Buckinghamshire when he left school.\nHe has been married twice; first to Susanne Hutton from 1967 to 1974 then to Christine Muirhead since 1977.

Jones, Diggs, and Young were high school classmates at Awalt High School in Mountain View, CA.  Jones and Young went on to UC Davis, while Diggs graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles.  PDP Systems started during Jones's time as a student at UC Davis as an OEM builder of computer memory chips into DRAM modules for many of the major PC manufacturers.\n\nStarting in 2003 PDP Systems released their own branded Patriot Memory line of DDR SDRAM to be sold in the retail and online market. Unlike the SDRAM manufacturers that released their SDRAM as bare modules, the Patriot Memory modules featured a bladed metal heat shielding across the entire DDR module. Patriot Memory continued the use of full module heat sinks across each generation of DDR generations to include DDR4.\n\nThe Patriot Memory brand eventually became the company name. Patriot Memory has two assembly lines at their facilities in Fremont, California, and Taipei, Taiwan. Jones credits keeping manufacturing in the US as a result of having highly automated machines and reduced shipping costs. Patriot continues to evolve their \"VIPER\" brand of memory modules, accessories (keyboards, mice, headsets, headset stands, mousepads, and USB flash drives), and \"BURST\" solid state drives.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nComputer hardware companies\nCompanies established in 1985\nCompanies based in Fremont, California\n1985 establishments in California", "machine_abstract": "The Patriot Memory is the first computer game developed by The Creative Assembly and published in 1992, based on the board game of the same name created by Games Workshop.\nPatriot Memory was released as shareware (a distribution method where software can be downloaded free-of-charge but users are encouraged to pay) under the title \"Operation Flashpoint\" before being re-released commercially after its success at retailers such as Virgin Megastores and EBay.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Patriot Memory\".

{"id": "Tropical Storm Pakhar (2017)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Pakhar%20%282017%29", "title": "Tropical Storm Pakhar (2017)", "text": "Tropical Storm Pakhar, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Jolina, was a strong tropical storm that impacted South China during late August 2017. This storm followed Typhoon Hato which affected the area a few days prior. Pakhar was the fourteenth named storm of the Pacific typhoon season. Pakhar developed from a tropical depression to the east of Luzon during August 24, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. Pakhar made landfall over in Aurora on August 25. Pakhar gradually intensified and peaked as a severe tropical storm by August 27, making landfall over Taishan, Jiangmen in Southern China.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nOn August 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed about 895\u00a0km (556\u00a0mi) to the north of the island of Palau. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours after the TCFA, the JMA began issuing advisories on the depression after they have determined that the system contained winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). By 15:00 UTC of the same day, the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning the numerical designation 16W. Three hours later, the JMA tracked that 16W had already strengthened into a tropical storm, giving 16W the name Pakhar. Around the same time, the PAGASA began issuing advisories under the local name Jolina. After it was depicted by satellite imagery that there were deep convection obscuring its low-level circulation center (LLCC), the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical storm.\n\nBy August 25, Pakhar slightly intensified after convective banding wrapping to its LLCC was depicted by imagery. Pakhar was also located in a very favorable environment such as low wind shear along with warm sea-surface temperatures of 31\u00a0\u00b0C (87.8\u00a0\u00b0F). Pakhar slightly intensified after a burst of deep convection developed just prior of making landfall over in Luzon in the province of Aurora. However, due to land reaction from the archipelago and the inclusion of a weakened convective structure, Pakhar weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity.\n\nAfter emerging to the South China Sea on August 26, Pakhar began to re-intensify as the storm entered in an area of a much lower amount of wind shear. However six hours later, Pakhar maintained its intensity after its LLCC became exposed and its deep convective banding became fragmented. By 18:00 UTC of the same day, the JMA upgraded Pakhar's intensity as a severe tropical storm, despite its central convection remaining disorganized. The PAGASA also stated that the storm had already exited their area of responsibility, issuing its final bulletin on Pakhar. By 00:00 UTC of August 27, Pakhar reached its maximum intensity of 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) with a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa while making landfall over in South China in the city of Taishan. The JTWC assessed Pakhar's maximum intensity slightly higher with winds of 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph), however. Three hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory. By 06:00 UTC, Pakhar began to rapidly weaken as the JMA downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm. The JMA tracked the system until 18:00 UTC of the same day when it fully dissipated.\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nPhilippines\n\nTropical Storm Pakhar was locally named as Jolina within the country by PAGASA. As soon as the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the storm, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal#1 was raised over most of Cagayan Valley and northern Aurora during August 24. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #2 was also raised in the same areas with the inclusion of the Cordillera Administrative Region while Signal #1 was extended to the Ilocos Region and Bicol Region. By August 25, a total of 16 provinces were placed in a warning as they were located within a  radius of the storm. Classes were suspended for all levels over in Albay, Bicol due to possible threats of flooding and landslides on August 25. The government also announced the suspension of classes for August 26 over in Metro Manila and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon. The province of Ilocos Sur declared the suspension of work in all public and private services that same day.\n\nThe Office of the Civil Defense warned residents of low-lying areas in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela of potential flooding. Kennon Road in Benguet were closed due to the threat of landslides. Hiking, trekking, and caving were suspended over in mountainous areas in the Mountain Province. Heavy rainfall from Pakhar caused the Magat Dam to overflow, which also submerged several bridges over in Isabela. A total of 11 flights to Hong Kong and South China from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were canceled due to the storm. Eight domestic flights were canceled throughout August 25.\n\nAccording to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 3,397 people were affected by the storm with 17 reports of flooding. The cities of Balatan, San Fernando and Ifugao suffered power outages throughout the storm. Overall, no casualties have been reported and damages were relatively minor. Recorded damages in Aurora province have reached PH\u20b141.27 million (US$808 thousand).\n\nHong Kong, Macau and South China\nStill recovering from the aftermath of Typhoon Hato which impacted the area four days earlier, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau issued a Tropical cyclone signal No. 8 for Macau late on August 26, as the storm approached. An orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai. A total of 206 flights were cancelled and another 471 delayed while 44 flights had to divert, including roughly 300 flights in total in Hong Kong being either cancelled or delayed, with 30 others diverted. There were 13 reports of flooding and 159 fallen trees over in Hong Kong. Two people were stranded in Kowloon Peak and moreover, the Government Flying Service deployed a Challenger 604 fixed-wing plane to locate 11 crew members waiting in the control room of a sinking Hong Tai 176 vessel.\n\nWhile making landfall, Pakhar brought winds of about 90 km/h (55 mph) with gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) over in Hong Kong, along with nearly 150 mm (6 in) of rainfall. A total of 9,000 emergency repairers, 97 emergency generator vehicles and 1,691 generators are in place in Guangxi and the Yangtze River flood control headquarters dispatched personnel for the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. \n\nAround 1:00 p.m local time, both the Macau and Hong Kong Observatory lowered their signal to a Tropical cyclone signal No. 3, but it wasn't until 10:10 p.m local time when all signals were down. The Home Affairs Department of Hong Kong opened 27 temporary shelters while the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui was closed temporarily. Ferry services across the Pearl River Delta were also suspended. Part of the Stonecutters Bridge was closed due to strong winds which made vehicles taller than 1.5 metres and motorcycles barred from using the bridge. Moreover, 51 people sought medical treatment in public hospitals and 231 people have sought refuge in shelters.\n\nAn orange typhoon warning was also raised over in the provinces of Shenzhen and Guangzhou while red warning was raised in Zhuhai. Furthermore, Hainan had a total of 24,124 fishing boats put into harbor. All of the water bus service was paused in Pearl River Delta.\nThe city of Taishan had recorded gusts of 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph). Pakhar drenched the Pearl River Delta region with the city of Shenzhen having total rainfall of 162\u00a0mm (6.4\u00a0in). The National Meteorological Center of China had forecast torrential rain over in the South China provinces from August 27\u201328, especially Guangdong and Guangxi could reach up to 1800\u00a0mm (71\u00a0in) of rain. A total of 9,000 emergency repairers, 97 emergency generator vehicles and 1,691 generators are in place in Guangxi and the Yangtze River flood control headquarters dispatched personnel for the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.\n\nA total of 83,000 people were affected by the storm, along with 14,000 people in which were evacuated over in the four main affected regions of Guandong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. One person died from a traffic incident while 62 were injured, while an additional two were confirmed hours later. Overall, 12 people were killed by Pakhar, and damages have reached CN\u00a5760 million (US$114.4 million).\n\nElsewhere\nThe remnants of Pakhar caused heavy rainfall in B\u1eafc K\u1ea1n Province, Vietnam. It cost 2 billion\u20ab (US$88,000) in damage. Pakhar brought extreme rainfall over in some parts of Thailand despite it not having any direct impact. Due to the torrential rain, a major reservoir in Sakon Nakhon had to be discharged, leading to a flood watch being issued in the northern parts of the country on August 28. The Nam Pung Dam also carried about 170 million cubic meters of water, about 3% over its usual holding capacity.\n\nSee also\n\nWeather of 2017\nTropical cyclones in 2017\n Other systems named Pakhar\n Tropical Storm Nida (2016)\n Tropical Storm Linfa (2015)\n Tropical Storm Soudelor (2009)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n JMA General Information of Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar (1714) from Digital Typhoon\n\n 16W.PAKHAR from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory\n South China Morning Post Topic : Typhoon Hato\n\n2017 disasters in China\n2017 disasters in the Philippines\n2017 in Hong Kong\n2017 Pacific typhoon season\nAugust 2017 events in China\nAugust 2017 events in the Philippines\nTyphoons in China\nTyphoons in Hong Kong\nTyphoons in the Philippines\nPakhar", "machine_abstract": "Tropical Storm Pakhar is the tenth tropical storm of the 2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and fourth named storm to form in May after Tropical Cyclone Gonu, Tropical Depression 01B, and Tropical Depression 02A.\nThe system formed on 5 May about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) south-southwest of Diego Garcia as part of a monsoon trough over South Asia.

{"id": "Scott Perry (politician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%20Perry%20%28politician%29", "title": "Scott Perry (politician)", "text": "Scott Gordon Perry (born May 27, 1962) is an American politician. He is the U.S. representative for . It was numbered the 4th district from 2013 to 2019. It includes Harrisburg, York and most of the inner suburbs.\n\nA member of the Republican Party, Perry represented the 92nd district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He is a retired Pennsylvania Army National Guard brigadier general. In November 2021, Perry was elected chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group among U.S. House Republicans.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack called for an interview with Perry \u2013 the first time it publicly sought to question a sitting member of Congress. Perry emphatically declined the request the next day. The panel's chairperson said it had evidence from several witnesses that Perry had \"an important role\" in efforts to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.\n\nEarly life and education\nPerry was born in San Diego, California. His family moved to Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a suburb of York, when he was seven. In 1980, he graduated from Northern High School in Dillsburg and Cumberland-Perry Vo-Tech School in York County, Pennsylvania. In 1991, Perry obtained a B.S. in business administration and management from Pennsylvania State University. In July 2012, he received a master's degree in strategic planning from the United States Army War College.\n\nMilitary service\n\nArmy National Guard\nPerry began his military career in 1980 when he enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and graduated from Advanced Individual Training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a technical drafting specialist. He graduated from Pennsylvania's Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery.\n\nAfter receiving his commission, Perry qualified as a helicopter pilot in the Aviation branch. He served in a variety of staff and command assignments as he advanced through the ranks, including executive officer of 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment during deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002\u20133, and commander of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 104th Aviation Regiment beginning in 2008.\n\nIraq war\nIn 2009\u201310, Perry commanded 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment during its pre-deployment training and service in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Task Force Diablo, 2-104th Aviation was credited with flying 1,400 missions, accruing over 13,000 combat flight hours, and transporting over 3 million pounds of cargo and 43,000 soldiers and civilians. Perry was credited with flying 44 missions and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours.\n\nPost-Iraq\n\nAfter returning from Iraq, Perry was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Pennsylvania National Guard's 166th Regiment (Regional Training Institute) (2010\u201312). From 2012 to 2014, he commanded the garrison at the Fort Indiantown Gap National Training Center. In May 2014, Perry was assigned as one of the assistant division commanders of the 28th Infantry Division, and he was promoted to brigadier general in November 2015. In May 2016, he was assigned as assistant adjutant general for Army at the Pennsylvania National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters. Perry retired from the Pennsylvania National Guard on March 1, 2019.\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1993, Perry founded Hydrotech Mechanical Services, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm in Dillsburg. The firm provides contract construction and maintenance services to municipal and investor-owned utilities from North Carolina to New York, specializing in large meter calibration. In 2002, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection accused the company of altering sewage monitoring reports while doing work for the Memphord Estates Sewage Treatment Company. Perry faced criminal charges of conspiring to falsify state-mandated sewage records. In the aftermath of the investigation and review, he was allowed to complete a diversion program and avoid any criminal charges, which allowed him to maintain his U.S security clearance.\n\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\n\nElections\nIn 2006, state representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House district decided to retire. Perry won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote, and took office on January 2, 2007. In 2008, Perry was reelected to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he was reelected to a third term unopposed.\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\n\n2012\n\nIn 2012, Perry gave up his state house seat to run for the 4th congressional district. The district had previously been the 19th district, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become U.S. Comptroller General, he spoke to Perry about running for the seat.\n\nPerry won a seven-way primary with over 50% of the vote. Although outspent nearly 2 to 1 in the campaign, he beat his closest competitor with nearly three times as many votes. Political newcomer Harry Perkinson, an engineer, advanced in a two-way Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 60%\u201334%.\n\n2014\n\nIn 2014, Perry was unopposed in the Republican primary and the former Harrisburg mayor, Linda D. Thompson, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 75%\u201325%.\n\n2016\n\nPerry won the 2016 election with no primary challenge and no official Democratic opponent. Joshua Burkholder of Harrisburg, a political novice, withdrew from the Democratic primary after too many signatures on his qualifying petition were successfully challenged. His subsequent write-in candidacy won the Democratic primary, but he was unaffiliated in the general election. Perry defeated Burkholder, 66%\u201334%.\n\n2018\n\nAfter ruling the state's congressional map an unconstitutional gerrymander, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new map for the 2018 elections. Perry's district was renumbered the 10th and made significantly more compact than its predecessor. It lost most of the more rural and Republican areas of York County to the neighboring 11th district (the old 16th). To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly to the north, absorbing the remainder of Democratic-leaning Dauphin County that had not been in the old 4th. On paper, the new district was less Republican than its predecessor. Had the district existed in 2016, Donald Trump would have won it with 52% of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 43%; Trump carried the old 4th with 58% of the vote.\n\nPastor and Army veteran George Scott won the Democratic primary by a narrow margin and opposed Perry in the general election for the reconfigured 10th. The two debated in October before Perry won with 51.3% of the vote to Scott's 48.7%, with the new district boundaries taking effect in 2019. Perry held on by winning the district's share of his home county, York County, by 11,600 votes. This was the district's closest race since 1974, when Bill Goodling won his first term in what was then the 19th with 51% of the vote.\n\n2020\n\nIn 2020, Perry had no Republican primary challenge, and the Pennsylvania auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, won a two-way Democratic primary. Perry was reelected with 53% of the vote in the general election.\n\nTenure\nPerry is a member of the Freedom Caucus. In November 2021, he was elected to chair the group, succeeding Andy Biggs in January 2022.\n\nIn October 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Perry accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of exaggerating the crisis in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn January 2018, Perry suggested that ISIS might have been involved in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities have maintained that gunman Stephen Paddock acted alone.\n\nIn December 2019, Perry was one of 195 Republicans to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Trump.\n\nIn October 2020, Perry was one of 17 Republicans to vote against a House resolution to formally condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. He said he voted against the resolution because he was concerned about infringements on free speech, saying, \"it's very dangerous for the government ... to determine what is okay to like and what is not okay to like.\"\n\nIn March 2021, Perry voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He said only 9% of the act's spending was allotted to defeat the COVID-19 virus, while the rest would advance Democratic policies.\n\nIn April 2021, at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting on immigration, Perry said, \"For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we're replacing national-born American\u2014native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation.\"\n\nIn June 2021, Perry was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6. He cosponsored a bill, introduced the same day, that would give the same medal to police officers without mentioning the attack.\n\nAt the June 2021 Republican Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, Perry said Democrats \"are not the loyal opposition. They are the opposition to everything you love and believe in\" and \"want to destroy the country you grew up in\", invoking comparisons to Nazis.\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2020, Perry voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which in part would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.\n\nIn March 2021, Perry was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat that overwhelmingly passed.\n\nIn July 2021, Perry voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407\u201316.\n\nImmigration\nPerry voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.\n\nPerry voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).\n\nInvolvement with 2020 presidential election\nAfter the 2020 general election, Perry promoted false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn December 2020, Perry was one of 126 Republican House members to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Perry joined Missouri senator Josh Hawley in objecting to counting Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. During the storming of the U.S. Capitol that day, Perry and his congressional colleagues were ushered to a secure location.\n\nPerry reportedly played a role in a December 2020 crisis at the Justice Department in which Trump considered firing acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, the acting chief of the civil division of the DOJ. The New York Times reported Perry introduced Clark to Trump because Clark's \"openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud presented Mr. Trump with a welcome change from the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who stood by the results of the election and had repeatedly resisted the president's efforts to undo them.\" Before the certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, Perry and Clark reportedly discussed a plan in which the Justice Department would send Georgia legislators a letter threatening an investigation into voter fraud and an invalidation of Georgia's electoral votes, even though the DOJ had investigated reports of fraud but found nothing significant, as attorney general Bill Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials and presented it to Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue. It claimed the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\" and urged the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors.\" Rosen and Donoghue rejected the proposal. In August 2021, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe had briefed top Justice Department officials that no evidence had been found of any foreign powers' interference with voting machines. Clark was reportedly concerned that intelligence community analysts were withholding information and believed Perry and others knew more about possible foreign interference. Clark requested authorization from Rosen and Donoghue for another briefing from Ratcliffe, asserting hackers had found that \"a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2021, House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to Perry asking him to provide information about his involvement in the effort to install Clark as acting attorney general. Thompson believed Perry had been involved in the effort to install Clark, given previous testimony from former acting attorney general Rosen and his deputy Donoghue, as well as communications between Perry and Meadows. Perry declined the request the next day, asserting the committee was illegitimate. Among several text messages to Meadows the committee released on December 14 was one attributed to a \"member of Congress\" dated January 5 that read \"Please check your signal,\" a reference to the encrypted messaging system Signal.

{"id": "Absalon-class frigate", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absalon-class%20frigate", "title": "Absalon-class frigate", "text": "The Absalon class are frigates of the Royal Danish Navy, commissioned in 2005. The two ships in the class may be described as a hybrid between a frigate and military transport ship with multiple role capabilities, with the capacity to be transformed from a combat ship with the firepower of a traditional frigate to a hospital ship within a day.\n\nDesign\nThe class is based on a frigate-like design, but built with an internal multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 soldiers with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two landing craft, personnel (LCPs) (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.\n\nThe ships have been designed by a joint team from The Royal Danish Navy (RDN), the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) and a group of contractors, primarily Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) to the Royal Danish Navy's requirements for a multi-mission frigate-like ship with an emphasis on flexibility.\n\nThe ships are built to the naval standards of Det Norske Veritas (DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, heavily utilizing STANAG.\n\nThe design is built with the aim of a large margin for growth over life-cycle, to a relatively low cost of ownership, with open architecture for ease of upgrades, with a high degree of automation allowing smaller crews, and utilizing StanFlex modules that can be shared across several ship classes in service with the Royal Danish Navy.\n\nThe hulls were built in highly competitive commercial shipyards using the latest development in the industries shipbuilding technology and cost-effective production procedures and processes. The outfitting and integration of sensor, communication and weapons systems was primarily carried out \"in-house\" by the RDN and DALO.\n\nThe standard weapons of the Absalon class can be supplemented through the use of StanFlex mission modules. A special weapons deck (nicknamed the 'Bathtub') is designed with five StanFlex module slots. Because of the Bathtub's position, only missile-firing weapons modules can be installed.\n\nHistory\nThe ships were named after two brothers, Esbern Snare and archbishop Absalon, who led the naval campaigns in the 12th century against the Wends, a group of pagan Slavs in northern Germany.\n\nProduction started at Odense Steel Shipyard on 30 April 2003, with the lead ship Absalon laid down on 28 November of that year. Esbern Snare followed on 24 March 2004; they were both launched later that year. They were delivered on 19 October 2004 and 17 April 2005 respectively, and commissioned on 10 January 2005 and 17 June 2005. At this point they had the StanFlex modules installed, but would have to wait until 2007 for full operational capability, with the installation of the 35mm CIWS, Mk32 torpedo launchers and Seagnat/SRBOC decoy systems.\n\nAmong other upgrades the two ships of the Absalon class were fitted with the newer Terma Scanter 6002 to replace the Scanter 2001 in 2020.\n\nFor political reasons, the ships were originally launched as \"Flexible support ships\" to avoid antagonising Russia after the end of the cold war. On the 16th of October 2020, both ships were reclassed as ASW-frigates. Both ships will be upgraded with towed array sonars in addition to the existing, hull-mounted sonar and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters will be equipped with dipping sonars, sonobuoys and torpedoes. This upgrade is expected to complete in 2026.\n\nList of ships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Danish Naval History\n Admiral Danish Fleet Headquarters\n Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization\n HDMS Absalon Command and Support Ship - Flexible Support Ship\n Naval Technology\n\nAmphibious warfare vessel classes\n \n \nShips of the Royal Danish Navy\n2004 ships\nFrigate classes", "machine_abstract": "The Absalon class is the first of two classes of stealth corvettes ordered by Denmark in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

{"id": "Nobles Emigrant Trail", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobles%20Emigrant%20Trail", "title": "Nobles Emigrant Trail", "text": "The Nobles Emigrant Trail, also known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road, is a trail in California that was used by emigrant parties from the east as a shortened route to northern California. It was pioneered in 1851 by William Nobles, who discovered an easy shortcut between the Applegate Trail in Nevada and the Lassen Trail in California. The trail was extensively used until the 1870s, when it was superseded by railroads.\n\nDiscovery and establishment\nThe main trail to California in the 1840s was the California Trail, which followed the Humboldt River in Nevada, then the Truckee River, and over the Donner Pass in California. A northern variation was pioneered by the Applegate brothers in 1846, using a more northerly route that connected with destinations in Oregon. Peter Lassen established a variant route that passed Lassen Peak on the way to the Sacramento area. Lassen scouted the area of Honey Lake with William H. Nobles for a legendary \"Gold Lake\", but having failed, they parted company, with Nobles continuing to the east and accidentally scouting a shorter, easier trail than Lassen's.\n\nNobles, born in New York in 1816, had moved to Minnesota in 1841 to work as a carpenter, then as a carpenter and wagon-maker. By 1851 he had moved on to California. When Nobles returned to California from his expedition with Lassen, he showed a party of  businessmen the route for a fee of $2000. With the subscribers vouching for the usefulness of the  route, he returned to Minnesota in 1853 to promote the route, marrying in Illinois along the way. The Minnesota legislature commissioned Nobles to present the route to Congress in Washington. Nobles' efforts persuaded Congress to appropriate $300,000 for an expedition along the route, led by Frederick W. Lander, who prepared a favorable report in February 1861. The route became known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Nobles was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and died in St. Paul in 1876. The trail was briefly considered for a railroad route. Its popularity contributed to the founding of Susanville and Redding.\n\nHistoric designation\nThe  section of trail within the boundaries of Lassen Volcanic National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1975. The section within the park is maintained as a hiking trail.\n\nThe trail has two California Historical Landmark markers: #675 marks a stopping place along the Noble Emigrant Trail that William Nobles established near the present-day city of Susanville, while #677 marks the spot where Peter Lassen first saw Honey Lake on October 4, 1850, while on his search for \"Gold Lake\".\n\nLassen Volcanic National Park\nThe trail within the park starts in the northeast corner, passing the edge of the Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, then skirting Prospect Peak. Crossing Badger Flats and passing through the Devastated Area associated with the May 21, 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak. The trail parallels the Lassen Park Road, then passes between the Chaos Crags and Table Mountain, across Sunflower Flat and over Nobles Pass, following the edge of the Chaos Jumbles. The trail leaves the northwest corner of the park near Manzanita Lake.\n\nReferences\n\nHistoric trails and roads in California\nHiking trails in California\nRoads on the National Register of Historic Places in California\nNational Register of Historic Places in Lassen Volcanic National Park\nProtected areas of Lassen County, California\nHistory of Lassen County, California\nProtected areas of Shasta County, California\nHistoric districts on the National Register of Historic Places in California\nNational Register of Historic Places in Shasta County, California", "machine_abstract": "The Nobles Emigrant Trail is the oldest road in Minnesota, and one of only two roads that were built before statehood (the other being The Old Military Road).

{"id": "Internet Brands", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Brands", "title": "Internet Brands", "text": "MH Sub I, LLC dba Internet Brands is an American new media company based in El Segundo, California, United States, that operates online media, community, and e-commerce sites in vertical markets. The company also develops and licenses internet software and social media applications.\n\nBusinesses\nThe company operates two divisions: consumer internet and licensing.\n\nConsumer Internet division\nThe consumer internet division owns and operates more than 95 websites in seven categories.  The company attracts more than 62 million unique visitors per month, with 97% of the audience originating from organic, non-paid sources.  The company's strategy is to focus on specific target audiences that tend to be attractive to advertisers.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Internet Brands acquired AllLaw.com and AttorneyLocate.com, both founded by Arvind A. Raichur.\n\nSEC filings indicate that approximately 70% of the company's revenues are derived from advertising from more than 40,000 accounts\u2014most of them small and medium enterprises.\n\nThe company's portfolio of websites include many with social media features: social network services, user generated content, blogs, wikis, and internet forums.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1998 as  CarsDirect.com, launched from the business incubator Idealab.  The company invented a consumer-advocacy approach to selling cars \"haggle-free\" online, an approach it continues to employ.  In 2000, Roger Penske invested in the company and joined the Board of Directors.  In 2002, Time Magazine voted the site one of the 50 best in the world.\n\nThe company changed its name to Internet Brands in 2005.  The company's IPO was in November 2007 on the NASDAQ exchange. INET was added to the NASDAQ Internet Index on March 22, 2010.\n\nInternet Brands agreed to be acquired for $640 million by the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman in September 2010 and was thus delisted from NASDAQ.\n\nIn September 2012, Internet Brands became involved in a legal battle with the Wikimedia Foundation (the operators of Wikipedia) over the future of Wikitravel's community.\n\nInternet Brands was acquired in June 2014 by KKR from Hellman & Friedman for 1.1 billion dollars. KKR is making its investment in partnership with Internet Brands chief executive officer Bob Brisco and the Internet Brands management team, who will hold a minority stake in the company and continue to run the business.\n\nIn January 2016, Intuit Inc. announced an agreement to sell Demandforce to Internet Brands.\n\nControversies\n\nvBulletin criticism\nIn October 2009, Internet Brands changed the pricing structure for its vBulletin software, prompting complaints from registered users on the official forums.  According to The Register those who complained were then banned from both the forums and from receiving support and updates, despite still having valid licences for the product.  Internet Brands defended their position to The Register in a separate article; however, a later update to the same article stated that at least some of Internet Brands' claims were false.\n\nvBulletin and XenForo\nIn October 2010, Internet Brands announced that it would file a lawsuit against the XenForo team claiming copyright infringement; specifically that code in XenForo was based on vBulletin code, breach of contract, and engaging in unfair business practices. In November 2010, Internet Brands sued Kier Darby, a lead developer of XenForo, who had previously served as a lead developer for Internet Brands' vBulletin, claiming that Kier had not returned confidential information from Internet Brands regarding the vBulletin software. The XenForo team has denied the claims.  In February 2013, the lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nWikitravel and Wikimedia\n\nIn 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction, community members at Internet Brands-owned website Wikitravel began discussing whether to fork (split off) of their work and editing activities from Wikitravel and recommence their editing activities at another website host. The dissatisfaction related to long standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive over-monetarization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.\n\nForking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is permitted by the Creative Commons license in use on sites such as Wikitravel, and the wiki software used by Wikitravel included the facility to take 'database \"dumps\"' for that purpose. This mirrored the fork of the German and Italian language Wikitravel communities some years earlier, which led to a new travel wiki site called Wikivoyage. Members of the communities concerned decided that the community at Wikitravel would move its editing efforts to merge with Wikivoyage, to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the owner of Wikipedia and a large range of other non-profit reference sites based upon a wiki community.\n\nThe merge and move were endorsed by the editing community, but opposed by Internet Brands who litigated against two users it accused of unlawful actions related to the proposal. The allegations were strongly rejected by the individuals and the (non-party) Wikimedia Foundation who stated the case was an example of a SLAPP lawsuit intended to deter and frustrate lawful conduct. On November 19, 2012, the claims by Internet Brands were dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nGreenlight Financial Services\nIn April 2013, on behalf of its client Greenlight Financial Services, Inc., the Rhema Law Group won a jury verdict trial against Internet Brands, Inc.  The Orange County Superior Court jury found that Internet Brands breached a previous settlement agreement between the parties and awarded lost profits damages in the amount of $750,000.\n\nModel Mayhem \nModelMayhem.com is a social media website where models can create profiles and publish pictures. In May 2008 Internet Brands bought Model Mayhem from the original developers Donald and Tyler Waitt. Model Mayhem was involved in the court case Jane Doe No. 14 v. Internet Brands, Inc., where litigants argued that Model Mayhem was liable for damages resulting from crimes committed by users on the website.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nMass media companies established in 1998\nAmerican companies established in 1998\nOnline mass media companies of the United States\nTechnology companies based in Greater Los Angeles\nCompanies based in El Segundo, California\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts companies\n1998 establishments in California\n2007 initial public offerings\nCompanies formerly listed on the Nasdaq\n2010 mergers and acquisitions\n2014 mergers and acquisitions", "machine_abstract": "The Internet Brands family of companies includes the following brands: The company was founded in 1998 by Mark Hughes and David Rowan, who were both previously employed at AOL (America Online).

{"id": "Net material product", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net%20material%20product", "title": "Net material product", "text": "Net Material Product (NMP) was the main macroeconomic indicator used for monitoring growth in national accounts of socialist countries during the Soviet era. These countries included the USSR and all the Comecon members. NMP is the conceptual equivalent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United Nations System of National Accounts, although numerically the two measures are calculated differently.\n\nNMP is calculated for the material production sectors only, and excludes most of the service sectors, which are part of GDP. The material production sectors include manufacturing industries,  agriculture and forestry, construction, wholesale and retail trade, supply of material inputs, road maintenance, freight transport (but not passenger transport), communication and information services supporting material production, and other material production activities. It is calculated by subtracting the value of all production costs (including the cost of material inputs, depreciation, and labor in production) from the value of output produced in the material production sectors.\n\nFor comparison with GDP, it is necessary to add back to NMP the value of fixed asset depreciation (which is not subtracted in GDP calculations) and the total value of all services classified as \"non-productive\" in the socialist system of national accounts (which are part of GDP). These \"non-productive\" services include health care, education, housing, public utilities, consumer services, communication in the non-productive sector, passenger transport, financial services (banking, credit, insurance), government services, the defense establishment, and social organizations. The tax components subtracted in the calculation of GDP should also be added back to obtain NMP.\n\nThe economic term that corresponds to Net Material Product in Russian is \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 (literally: national income). None of the accepted meanings of national income in English matches the meaning in Russian, and Net Material Product was introduced into English usage as the best alternative.\n\nGDP and NMP for USSR 1980\u20131990\nGDP began to be calculated in the USSR in 1988, based essentially on the United Nations System of National Accounts. The table compares the new GDP estimates with the traditional NMP numbers (in billions of current rubles). GDP is seen to be 25%\u201330% higher than NMP due to depreciation and the \"non-productive\" service sectors included in GDP but not in NMP.\n\nSource: Narodnoye khoziaystvo SSSR 1990, statistical yearbook of the USSR, p. 5.\n\nNMP growth for Comecon countries\nChange in NMP (in constant prices) 1980\u20131990 (in percent of 1980)\n\nSource: Statistical Yearbook of Comecon Countries 1989, Table 21, p. 59.\n\nSee also\nMaterial Product System\nProductive and unproductive labour\nValue product\n\nReferences\n \n GDP (\u0412\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442) in Finansovo-Kreditnyi Slovar, Finansy i Statistika, Moscow (1984), vol.

In his preface Braithwaite describes himself as being in the service of the African Company, and as having, when very young, served in the fleet in Anne's reign, and then having been a lieutenant in the Welsh fusiliers, ensign in the Royal Guards, and secretary to his kinsman Christian Cole, the British resident at Venice, with whom he traveled through Europe. Braithwaite married Christian's niece Silvia, whose father was a merchant in Amsterdam.\n\nHe also states that he was in the Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent expeditions, and was present at the siege of Gibraltar (1727). Thence he crossed to Morocco and joined the British consul-general, John Russel, in his expedition in the emperor's dominions, the experiences of which he relates in his book. The diary of the narrative extends from July 1727 to February 1728.\n\nDeath and family \n\nCol John Braithwaite was killed when the vessel \"Baltick Merchant\" was attacked and captured by a Franco-Spanish privateer (the \"Biscaya\") off the Scilly Isles.  Braithwaite was murdered after the surrender.  He was survived by his wife, Silvia (nee Cole),  his elder daughter Caroline,  who married Robert Armitage,  his  only son  Major-General Sir John Braithwaite, 1st Baronet and  a younger daughter, Sylvia.  The last is assumed to have been born after the death of Colonel Braithwaite. She married  the poet  Bonnell Thornton. Her mother remarried Reverend Thomas Winstanley and had a further son, Thomas, who died at 21. The elder Silvia died in 1799.\n\nA Captain Braithwaite is mentioned in the London Gazette as being appointed in 1749 to command the Peggy sloop, and again in 1761 as commanding the Shannon.

{"id": "2797 Teucer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2797%20Teucer", "title": "2797 Teucer", "text": "2797 Teucer  is a large Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately  in diameter. It was discovered on 4 June 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7\u20135.6\u00a0AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8. In June 2014, an observed asteroid occultation gave a cross-section of  (poor fit).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\n002797\nDiscoveries by Edward L.

He subsequently served as Governor of Bermuda from 1949 to 1955.\n\nEarly life \nHood was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and educated at George Watson's College. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1910 and achieving his MD in 1931 for his research on dysentery. In 1918, Hood married Evelyn Dulcia Ellwood, with whom he had one son and two daughters.\n\nMilitary career \nAfter spending one year as the house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Hood joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He served in France and Belgium during the First World War, and then in India and Afghanistan shortly afterwards. He became a specialist in pathology, serving in Meerut and Bangalore and then as deputy assistant district pathologist for Madras region. Hood conducted research on cerebrospinal meningitis and pneumonic plague, and in 1929 he was appointed assistant district pathologist to Southern Command.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Hood was given the rank of colonel and made deputy director of medical services, Palestine. In 1941, he was promoted over several more senior figures to become Lieutenant-General Director General Army Medical Services. As DGAMS, Hood was credited with supporting developments in Army Psychiatry, helping to provide forward surgery and reorganise field medical units, and organising a blood transfusion service. By August, he was also honorary physician to George VI. He served for far longer as DGAMS than was usual. He also decreed that medical research conducted on soldiers should be solely for the purpose of preventing and curing disease and allaying injury. Hood had hoped to become the first head of a combined medical service for Navy, Army and Air Force, but this did not happen.\n\nCivil career \nHood worked for one year in the Ministry of Health. After this, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief Bermuda. As Governor, Hood oversaw the closure of the Bermuda Garrison in 1953 and also acted as host to Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Bermuda Conferences. The closure of the garrison was completed by 1 May 1953, but was very short-lived. However, a detachment of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was temporarily posted to Bermuda immediately after for the period of the conference, planned for June, 1953. The conference was actually delayed until December, when the Prime Minister was convinced to reverse the closure of the garrison, resulting in 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (1 DCLI) being posted to Prospect Camp in 1954. Hood's tenure in the role was extended twice.\n\nHood resigned effective 26 April 1955, with no explanation given. A few months later, he was granted a divorce from Lady Evelyn Dulcia Hood and married Mrs Helen Winifred Wilkinson of Hamilton, Bermuda on the same day.\n\nOther achievements \nHood enjoyed golf and was the RAMC champion.

{"id": "Monis Rahman", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monis%20Rahman", "title": "Monis Rahman", "text": "Monis Rahman is a Pakistani internet entrepreneur, venture capitalist and businessman. Rahman is the co-founder and executive chairman of Naseeb Networks, Inc. a business-oriented social network used primarily for online job recruiting.  Rahman has been listed among the top entrepreneurs of 21st century several times. Forbes named him at #6 on its list of top \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\".\n\nCareer\n\nEarly years\nAfter completing his studies at Wisconsin, Rahman went to work at Intel. With the Intel team, he developed an Itanium microprocessor chip between 1991 and 1996 and left the job after looking at the dot-com bubble rise in order to start his own company. In 1997, Rahman and a partner started a company that installed cameras in daycare centers, allowing parents to watch the video streams online in real time. Edaycare.com attracted $2.5 million from investors, including Ron Conway, an early stage investor of Google and PayPal. A year later Rahman and his partner ran out of money, forcing them to sell the company for stock that was beneficially worthless.\n\nNaseeb Networks, Inc.\nAfter a hiatus of four years and working as a consultant, Rahman decided to start a social networking site for Muslims in the United States and United Kingdom, after looking at the success of similar website Friendster.com. He named it \"Naseeb.com\" (meaning \"destiny\"). Built as a social site, it was considered more of match-making portal, but Rahman said, \"I decided not to go head-on as a matchmaking site... 'Dating' has a negative stigma from a Muslim viewpoint.\" Naseeb.com was then invested in by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman with $25,000, while Mark Pincus of Zynga and Joe Kraus of Excite also stepped in as angel investors.\n\nDescribing the inspiration behind Naseeb, Rahman said, \"I was exploring the Pakistani market since my family had moved here. I realized that the biggest cost in running a web company was of human capital. And the running cost in Pakistan would have been 1/18th of what it would have been in the US. So that's when I decided to come back and start Naseeb.com, which exploded very quickly. We were the first one to be doing any kind of serious business on the internet back then. And we had little to no competition in the market.\"\n\nIn 2002, Rahman returned to Pakistan and registered his company as Naseeb Networks, Inc., both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in San Jose, California, US, to make it easier to raise money and investors. He spent $60,000 as a startup cost for Naseeb and initially handled the company on his own. To prime the market, he used equity in the company to buy the electronic greeting card site eidmubarak.com, which allow Muslims to send cards for Eid, a Muslim holiday. Three thousand people from the site's 1-million-strong mailing list signed up immediately. Annual memberships cost $40, and by 2005 the website was generating $300,000 in revenue.\n\nWith the expansion of company Rahman needed programmers and developers, and buying ads in local newspapers was expensive. He recalls, \"I started Naseeb.com from my house, but later moved out as we grew. Now when hiring, I ran into a lot of problems finding the right talent. At that time, one job ad in the classified section in Dawn News, roughly cost PKR 850,000 which was ridiculous! So I decided to put my ads online.\"\n\nRozee.pk\n \nIn 2005, Rahman built a \"quick and dirty\" job site to post job openings for his parent company Naseeb Networks. Many other companies contacted Rahman to post their companies' and products' ads on his website. Rahman agreed to post their ads free of cost to help boost Naseeb's traffic. After receiving such a reception, the website became the primary business of Naseeb Networks.\n\nRahman then offered the largest companies the ability to search for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, as well as software to power their own companys' job boards and the right to post their logos on the front page of his new site. He named it \"Rozee\", an Urdu language word which means \"livelihood\", or translates roughly as \"blessed livelihood.\"\n\nIn 2007 Rozee.pk went into a completely functioning state, generating more traffic than Naseeb. Rahman used Naseeb's proceeds, and $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and ePlanet Ventures, to hire salespeople to go after large corporate clients, most of which still advertised job openings in newspapers. More than 63 000 companies actively post openings on Rozee.pk, paying between $29 for a single ad and up to $20,000 for a suite of services.\n\nRozee.pk has been listed as the number one employment website in Pakistan, with more than 65 thousand companies posting jobs, 32.53 million applications processed and 6 million unique visitors every day. In 2015, Rozee.pk won $6.5 million of investment from Vostok Nafta and Piton Capital, bringing the company's total venture capital funding to $8.5 million.\n\nIn an interview Rahman stated, \"As talent continues to move online at a rapid pace in emerging markets, businesses need increasingly sophisticated recruiting technology customized to nuanced local market dynamics.\"\n\nIt was the latest in a series of large venture capital investments in Pakistan over the previous year and a half. Managing director Per Brilioth said, \"We are excited to partner with Naseeb Networks and impressed with what Rahman and his team have achieved in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia... We believe these markets present massive growth opportunities and are looking forward to working with the team to expand the reach of Naseeb Networks' world-class products and services.\" Michael Porter of AllWorld Network listed the company as one of Pakistan's fastest growing private companies. American writer Elmira Bayrasli visited Pakistan in 2010 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of the country and listed Rahman as an \"example to entrepreneurs\" in her 2015 book, From the Other Side of the World. She claimed that the \"next Silicon Valley could be in Lahore, Mumbai or Istanbul.\"\n\nChalo.pk\nIn 2011, Rahman launched a location-based online shopping portal that features \"local daily deals and listings for the most affordable things to do, place to eat, and brands to buy\" in cities throughout Pakistan. Rahman said, \"Chalo is my experiment. We have hundreds of SMEs in Pakistan who can't afford to promote themselves on large platforms like newspapers, billboards, TV etc. We're helping them expand & grow through Chalo.pk... We're also experimenting with Maps. We spent 2 years building our own maps database, and now we have mapped every single house address in any planned society in Lahore. We\u2019ve also mapped all the restaurants, their menus and other details in the app. So people can navigate to them really easily. If you want to watch a movie, we're listing all the movies being shown in all the cities, and soon we'll be adding a Buy button.\"\n\nDigital Publishers Association of Pakistan\nIn 2012, Rahman co-founded the Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), with several publications and portal owners including Masood Hamid (President), Monis Rahman (Vice President), Sarmad A. Ali (Member Executive Committee), Lucas Peter (Secretary General), Imran Ansari (Joint Secretary), Qudratullah Shahab (Member Executive Committee), and Sarah Sohail (Finance Secretary). The association aims to \"safeguard interests of all stakeholders in the burgeoning digital market and create a regulated playing field.\"\n\nMihnati.com acquisition\nIn 2013, Rozee.pk bought Saudi employment website Mihnati.com for an undisclosed amount. Discussing the acquisition, Rahman said, \"We have merged both Rozee.pk and Mihnati by migrating all Mihnati employers and jobseekers on to the Rozee.pk technology platform. By doing this, we gave our Saudi sales team a far more powerful product to sell with more features.\"\n\nOther works and future ventures\nAfter establishing himself, Rahman served as a head or partner of several technology firms in Pakistan, including as a member of the board of directors at Kashf Microfinance Bank Limited  (2010-2012), and of the Pakistan Advisory Board at Acumen Fund (2010-2013). Currently he is a member of the Young Presidents' Organization (2010) Governing Board (CEC) at Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITES (P@SHA) (2013), Secretary General and founding member at Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), and a member of the Global Board of Trustees (BoT) at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE, Lahore) (2012).\n\nRahman is regarded as one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. Many have listed him in their top ten lists of CEOs and entrepreneurs. In 2016, Rahman was listed among the top CEOs of Pakistan, was placed at No. 6 among the Top 10 Most Influential Tech Leaders of Pakistan, and was ranked at #3 among the \"Top 5 E-commerce Business Tycoons of Pakistan\". Rahman is a TED speaker and is frequently invited to talk on entrepreneurship and Internet marketing at the world's top business schools and conferences.\n\nIn 2016, Rahman together with Qasif Shahid developed a digital mobile wallet to increase digital payments' scale rapidly. The mobile wallet is telco, bank and handset agnostic with the philosophy of inter-operating collaboratively with existing payment plumbing. It is jointly funded by Finca Microfinance Bank and the e-company Finja. In an interview Qasif said, \"We believe banking products should look more like social networks than conventional banking products.\"  Rahman said, \"Our mobile wallet's open API platform will allow much needed collaborative creativity from other FinTechs to be leveraged to create building blocks for a wider array of useful financial products.\"\n\nAwards and honors\n 2008: International Data Group CIO Pakistan Pioneer in Innovation Award\n 2011: Forbes \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\"\n 2012: Pakistan Power 100 Excellence Award\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Rahman's profile at Rozee.pk\n \n Rahman at Naseeb Networks, Inc.\n\nLiving people\nBusinesspeople in computing\nPakistani computer businesspeople\nStanford University alumni\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni\nPakistani expatriates in Saudi Arabia\nPakistani expatriates in the United States\nPakistani venture capitalists\nSilicon Valley people\nPakistani company founders\nBusinesspeople from Lahore\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_abstract": "Morisaki, Masayuki (May 31, 2007). \"India's nuclear test ban treaty negotiator dies at age 83\".

{"id": "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All%20the%20Boys%20Love%20Mandy%20Lane", "title": "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane", "text": "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is a 2006 American slasher film directed by Jonathan Levine and starring Amber Heard, Michael Welch, Whitney Able, and Anson Mount. The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.\n\nOriginally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of film festivals throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Toronto International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, and London FrightFest Film Festival. It received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane received mixed reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as \"bogus and compromised\", and others praising its \"grindhouse\" aesthetic and likening its cinematography to the early work of Terrence Malick and Tobe Hooper.\n\nDespite its international attention, the film remained unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from The Weinstein Company. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States. The film became available through video on demand in September 2013, and was given a limited release on October 11, 2013, through a joint contract between Senator Entertainment and Weinstein's subsidiary label Radius-TWC.\n\nPlot\nAt a Texas high school, Mandy Lane blossoms over the summer, attracting her male classmates. One of them, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house. She accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet can come along. At the party, Dylan bullies and humiliates Emmet until Mandy intervenes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump from the roof into the pool, but Dylan fails to scale the pool, and smashes his head on the concrete, which kills him.\n\nNine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been subjected to even more intense bullying. Their stoner classmate Red plans a weekend party at his father's remote cattle ranch, and Mandy reluctantly accepts an invitation from Chloe, a popular but insecure cheerleader. Mandy accompanies Red and Chloe, along with several other classmates\u2014reserved football player Bird, and couple Jake and Marlin\u2014to Red's ranch. Upon arriving, they are introduced to Garth, the ranch hand.\n\nThat night, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs oral sex on him. They have another argument, and after he walks back to the house, an unseen assailant knocks Marlin out and breaks her jaw with the barrel of a shotgun. Back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy. Anxious about Marlin, he takes Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for her. He eventually finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head and breaks Marlin's neck, killing both.\n\nEmmet drives back to the ranch in Red's truck and sees the rest of the group on the porch. He shoots fireworks at them. Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake, playing a prank. Emmet confronts Bird and attacks him, eventually slashing his eyes with a knife and stabbing him to death. The rest of the group, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.\n\nThe next morning, as the group leaves out the front door, Emmet shoots and wounds Garth. While Mandy tends to Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car. Emmet shoots Red and chases after Chloe. In Garth's shack, Mandy retrieves the keys to his Bronco and finds the bloodied knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction. Mandy embraces Chloe, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is in league with Emmet.\n\nAs Chloe bleeds to death, Mandy and Emmet discuss the suicide pact they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her, but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times. Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses. Mandy grabs a log and defends herself against Emmet's machete. Eventually she gets the upper hand and kills him. She returns to an injured Garth and they drive away from the ranch. Garth thanks Mandy for saving him, assuming she was merely a victim.\n\nA flashback shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While the rest goof off, Mandy balances on the tracks and watches her future victims.\n\nCast\n\nAnalysis\nSeveral film critics have drawn comparisons between the events in the film and those perpetrated by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teenagers responsible for the Columbine massacre\u2014in particular, the character of Emmet, who in one scene is shown wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.\n\nFilm scholars Cristelle Maury and David Roche, in their introduction to Women Who Kill: Gender and Sexuality in Film and Series of the Post-Feminist Era (2020), note that the film inverts the trope of the \"final girl\" by revealing her to be a \"diabolical mastermind.\" Writing of the revelation, they note: \"As Mandy beckons her, Chloe runs right into her friend's arms, impaling herself on a knife in a back shot that prevents us from anticipating such an outcome...\u00a0 The twist is merely a millennial update of the ending in Friday the 13th (1980), with two significant differences: Mandy's sadism warrants no justification, and as the film's Final Girl, she is the audience's stand-in.\"\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film had initially been conceived in 2003 when writer Jacob Forman, producer Chad Feehan, and production designer Tom Hammock were all students at the American Film Institute. \"I actually started it as my thesis at AFI,\" Feehan told Twitch Film. \"The writer, Jacob Forman and the production designer Tom Hammock and I did it as our thesis together at AFI. We started working on it in 2003, then graduated and got it financed and were able to hire our friends that we graduated with to make the movie. It was obviously quite a journey from 2003 to 2006 when we sold it to the Weinstein Company, and after that it's been pretty trying.\"\n\nLevine later told the Austin Chronicle that he and screenwriter Jacob Forman had drawn inspiration from Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) as well as the NBC television series Friday Night Lights and John Hughes films. According to Levine, he and cinematography Darren Genet had also drawn inspiration from The Virgin Suicides (1999) and Dazed and Confused (1993) when developing the film's depiction of teenagers.\n\nLead performer Amber Heard said that when she received the script for the film in Los Angeles, she felt it was noticeably \"different\".  In an interview, she said, \"There are so many [scripts] you get where it feels like you're reading the same girl over and over again. And then I read this script and I thought it was truly different and that it could be done well. This was a movie that was really under the radar; no one was really talking about it. It didn't have much money and subsequently it didn't get much attention right off the bat.\"\n\nCasting\nIn conceiving her character, Heard stated that Mandy Lane \"[represents] many, many real girls. Many real teenagers, especially in America. There are a lot of incidents of this kind of violence in school with the perpetrators being cute teenagers against their classmates. Their victims are their classmates and they're often their bullies.... [Mandy]'s a great representation of all those girls who are insecure and uncomfortable with their sexuality and their power and yet they're strangely intrigued by it and tempted by it.\"\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on location in Austin, Texas, and nearby Bastrop in 2006, on a budget of $750,000. According to Amber Heard, she spent little time with the rest of the cast when filming wasn't taking place in order to maintain a distance necessary to her character. She also said that the shoot was very low-maintenance, saying, \"Everyone has these expectations, whether they're subconscious or not, of the glamour and how much fun that you can have in L.A. and I went with those same expectations. This was my first shoot, my first leading role. I fly to my hometown, funnily enough, to film and I stand out in this field waiting for my hair and make-up. Instead of the chair, instead of the lights, I stand in the middle of a field and have, literally, a bucket of freshly-dug mud dumped on my head.\"\n\nAnson Mount recalled the film shoot as being \"very well organized by the producers. All we had to do was show up to work and have a good time. It was a very aggressive production by what was then a very young company, Occupant.\"\n\nRelease\nAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane premiered on September 10, 2006, at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by screenings at the Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, London FrightFest Film Festival, the IFI Horrorthon, at the French Cinemath\u00e8que.\n\nDistribution\nUpon the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006, film executive Harvey Weinstein, \"in characteristically aggressive deal-making mode,\" sought to purchase distribution rights after its screening ended around 1:30 am. By 5:00 am on September 11, 2006, an agreement was reached, and a contract was signed later that morning, with The Weinstein Company officially purchasing global distribution rights for a reported $3.5 million. In the contract, Weinstein committed to giving the film a wide release in the United States under the Weinsteins' Dimension Films branch. Harvey Weinstein's brother Bob Weinstein, who managed Dimension Films, reportedly did not feel the film warranted a wide release: \"I didn't feel that it was the right way to approach an artful film like this,\" he said. A test screening was undertaken in New Jersey, after which less than 30% of the audience reported a positive response, leaving the Weinsteins reluctant to give the film a wide release.\n\nDespite the poor test screening, Dimension Films slated the film for a U.S. release of July 20, 2007. However, due to the subsequent financial failure of the studio's Grindhouse, among other horror films, the Weinstein Company instead sold the film to Senator Entertainment US. Senator, a German company who had acquired distribution rights for the film in Germany and Austria, had recently established a U.S. branch. An American release through Senator never materialized, however, after the company's U.S. branch went out of business in April 2009, leaving the film held in limbo with other unreleased projects.\n\nIn 2008, the film was screened at the G\u00e9rardmer Film Festival, Lyon L'\u00c9trange Festival, and the Fantasia Film Festival, and received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008, through Optimum Releasing. Between 2008 and 2010, it continued to open in various foreign markets, receiving theatrical releases in Germany and Austria (through Senator), as well as in Sweden, Mexico, Peru, and the Netherlands, among others.\n\nAt Comic-Con 2010, director Levine and star Heard appeared for a screening of the film, and hinted that a North American release was finally forthcoming, though they did not say when or who would be handling the release. In the spring of 2013, it was reported that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired distribution rights to the film. Several months later, the film was released on demand in North American markets through The Weinstein Company subsidiary, Radius-TWC, on September 6, 2013, and given a limited theatrical release on October 11, 2013, in the United States\u2014over seven years after its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBox office\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom in February 2008, the film grossed a total of US$400,851. It garnered an additional $482,500 in Germany upon its June 2008 release there. It was released in various other countries over the course of 2008 and 2009, and by April 2010 had grossed an international total of $1,893,697, more than covering its $750,000 budget.\n\nCritical response\nThe film received mixed reviews upon its initial festival screenings and subsequent European theatrical release in 2008. It holds a 46% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus states: \"Mandy Lane has enough wit and craft to spark the horror fans' interest, but is not sufficiently original for mainstream audiences.\" On the website Metacritic, the film received a score of 44 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIt received a favorable review from The Globe and Mail, who wrote that it \"displays an intelligence lacking in most teen slasher pics,\" and Film Threat called the film \"a well-shot, [...] semi-cerebral horror film.\" eFilmCritic wrote that the film's writing of its titular character is flawed, but it \"evokes the rich landscapes of early Terrence Malick and the grimy grindhouse tales of the \u201870s, converging poetically into its heartmashing climax. This is a film where the blood and carnage doesn\u2019t feel like corn syrup or CGI and each death grows in sadness, not quality.\" Bloody Disgusting called it \"a solid entry into the slasher genre and a pretty damn good teen thriller too boot.\" Other critics gave the film less flattering reviews, with The Guardian calling it \"bogus and compromised: an unreconstructed horror romp in the guise of a nerdish intellectual.\" Slant Magazine said the film \"flaunts its knowledge of classic genre fundamentals but fails to do anything very clever or surprising with them,\" and later compared its cinematography and aesthetic mood to The Virgin Suicides (1999). Tim Robey of The Telegraph called the film \"arrestingly well shot for a low-budget horror,\" but noted that it had an \"anorexic plot.\"\n\nThe film continued to receive mixed reviews upon its theatrical release in the United States in October 2013. Nicholas Rapold of The New York Times praised the film, noting that \"cinematographer Darren Genet draws from long shots of pursuits and a vaguely 1970s look, which wasn\u2019t cutting-edge during the film\u2019s making but suits the real-time nostalgia of high school activities, even murderous ones,\" and Scott Weinberg of FEARnet said the film \"[brings] a quietly artistic taste of teen-aged sexual politics to a subgenre that's generally disinterested in anything resembling brains, wit, or subtext.\" The Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review as well, calling it \"a small, tightly coiled spellbinder,\" and praised Heard's performance, referring to it as her most \"definitive [performance] to date.\"\n\nThe New York Post gave the film a less favorable review, calling it \"A slightly artsy attempt to revive the teen slasher movie [that] drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece.\" Christy Lemire of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"[With the opening scene], Levine promisingly sets a dark and disturbing tone. But the vast majority of the film, which takes place nine months later, is a rather standard depiction of the bad kids trying to corrupt the last American virgin.\" Lemire also commented on the film's delayed release history, stating: \"Its attempts at examining and subverting the well-worn conventions of the genre in the script from Jacob Forman might have seemed more novel seven years ago. But by now we've seen this approach executed much more effectively\u2014and thrillingly.\" The Washington Post, however, praised the film's acting and thematics, writing: \"Thoughtful viewers may detect thematic whiffs of Columbine, blended with Carrie that darken and complicate the film\u2019s aroma of stale blood. Thoughtful viewers? What kind of teen slasher movie is this? Too dumb for the arthouse, but too smart for the mall multiplex, the movie satisfies, paradoxically, precisely because it doesn\u2019t deliver on expectations.\"\n\nIn his book Nightmare Movies: Horror on Screen Since the 1960s, film scholar Kim Newman likened the film's teenage characters to the troubled youth in works by Richard Linklater or Larry Clark.\n\nHome media\nAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane was released on Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom in a Region 2 format on July 21, 2008, by Optimum Home Entertainment. It was released in North America on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 format on December 3, 2013, through Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n\nSoundtrack\nAlthough an official soundtrack was not released, the film features the following songs:\n\n \"In Anticipation of Your Suicide\" by Bedroom Walls\n \"84\" by  Nude\n \"Slowly, Just Breathe\" by Dead Waves\n \"Good Day\" by Kunek\n \"Our Lips Are Sealed\" by The Go-Go's\n \"Thin Air\" by Brian Jennings\n \"Sister Golden Hair\" by Gerry Beckley, covered by Juliette Commagere\n \"Do Ya\" by Peaches\n \"Piano Concerto No. 5 in E Flat Major, Second Movement\" by Ludwig van Beethoven\n \"Oh Molly Dear\" by B.

{"id": "Elizabeth Fretwell", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth%20Fretwell", "title": "Elizabeth Fretwell", "text": "Betty Drina Fretwell  (13 August 1920 \u2013 5 June 2006), known professionally as Elizabeth Fretwell, was an Australian soprano.  She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nEarly life and career \nShe was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill, she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Birgit Nilsson.\n\nAfter returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero n\u00e9e Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist.  This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom.\n\nSadler's Wells\nOnce in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company.  Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America.\n\nLater career and death\nIn 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970.  During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career, she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers.\n\nHer retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons.   She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years.\n \nShe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977.  On 5 June 2006, she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85.   She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 births\n2006 deaths\nAustralian operatic sopranos\nSingers from Melbourne\nAustralian Officers of the Order of the British Empire\n20th-century Australian women opera singers", "machine_abstract": "Elizabeth Fretwell (born Elizabeth Mary Fretwell; 16 May 1943 \u2013 1 September 2006) was the wife of British Conservative Party politician Michael Howard MP, who served as Leader of the Conservatives from 1997 to 2001 and Mayor of London in 2002\u201304.\nFretwell died on 1 September 2006 at her home near Woking after suffering a stroke aged 61 years old.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Elizabeth Fretwell\".

Cambodia has an embassy in New Delhi, and India has an embassy in Phnom Penh.\n\nRelations between Cambodia and India goes back to ancient times. India's influence in Cambodia is visible from the Hindu-style temples of Angkor Wat to written Khmer, which is a derivative of the Pallava script from present-day southern India.\n\nBoth nations are part of the Non-Aligned Movement.  India established formal diplomatic relations with the Heng Samrin regime and opened its embassy in Phnom Penh in 1981 when Cambodia was internationally isolated. India had provided various personnel to conduct the UNTAC-sponsored elections in Cambodia in 1993. The Government of India agreed to preserve Angkor Wat temple when the Government of Cambodia appealed, between 1986 and 1993 and spent around 4 million dollars during this conservation.\n\nWhile Cambodia has historically aligned itself more with the People's Republic of China, India's greatest geopolitical rival, Therav\u0101da Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practiced by around 95% of the Cambodian population, and its intrinsic Indian culture has considerably impacted Cambodian society and culture.\n\nState visits\n \nThe former President of India, Pratibha Patil, visited Cambodia in 2010 on a state visit and asked the Indian diaspora in the country to, \"be the bridge between the two countries to access knowledge, expertise, resources and markets for the development of the country of their origin\". While human resource development and capacity building have been the primary focus of our bilateral relations, India is extremely happy to cooperate with Cambodia in infrastructural projects, as well as in projects related to conservation and preservation of historical monuments.\"\n\nPrime Minister Samdech Hun Sen visited India in January 2018. The two countries signed four key agreement to enhance bilateral cooperation during the visit. The agreements include an MoU on the prevention of human trafficking, a mutual legal assistance treaty in criminal matters, a cultural exchange programme, and a $36.92 million line of credit from India to help develop the Stung Sva Hab water resource development project. India and Cambodia also agreed on facilitating exchanges between senior-level defence personnel and capacity-building projects, and also jointly endorsed the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nIndian diaspora in Cambodia\n\nThe first Indians in modern times to settle in Cambodia arrived in the 1960s and 1970s. Primarily coming from the northern province of Punjab, they worked as jewellers, moneylenders and traders around Central Market, but they left the country once the Khmer Rouge arrived. The Indians returned to Cambodia when Pol Pot\u2019s regime collapsed.\n\nThere is an Indian diaspora in Cambodia and they have established an Indian Association, Cambodia.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nLokesh, Chandra, & International Academy of Indian Culture.

{"id": "Palestinian literature", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian%20literature", "title": "Palestinian literature", "text": "Palestinian literature refers to the Arabic language novels, short stories and poems produced by Palestinians. Forming part of the broader genre of Arabic literature, contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common.\n\nHistorical Origins\nPalestinian literature is one of numerous Arabic literatures, but its affiliation is national, rather than territorial. While Egyptian literature is that written in Egypt, Jordanian literature is that written in Jordan etc., and up until the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war, Palestinian literature was also territory-bound, since the 1948 Palestinian exodus it has become \"a literature written by Palestinians\" irrespective of their place of residence.\n\nOverview\n\nPalestinian Literature spoke to other causes of oppression and discrimination across the world. In his book, one of the foremost leaders of Palestinian literature and the person who coined the term Palestinian Resistance Literature, Ghassan Kanafani says, \"In my stories I give my characters the freedom to express their own positions without reservation\". This sense of international solidarity can also be found in Palestinian poets' work such as in Mahmoud Darwish's poem Cuban Chants, \"And the banner in Cuba.. The rebel raises it in the Aures.. Oh a nation that feels cold\", and in Samih Al-Qasim's poem, Birds Without Wings.\n\nIn the period between the 1948 Palestinian exodus and the 1967 Six-Day War, Palestinian Resistance Literature played a significant role in maintaining the Palestinian identity; forming a bridge between the two periods, which allowed the Palestinian identity to survive especially in the absence of armed resistance. In his book, Palestinian Resistance Literature Under Occupation, Ghassan Kanafani argues, \"Palestinian resistance literature, just like armed resistance, shapes a new circle in the historical series which practically has not been cut throughout the last half century in the Palestinian life\u201d. \n \nSince 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three \"branches\" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.\n\nHannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside. She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in the Studies in the Humanities journal, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as \"writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine.\" However, Maurice Ebileeni argues that a fourth branch referring exclusively to anglophone literary works is not sufficient. Rather, Palestinian displacement both in Israel/Palestine and the diaspora have led to cultural and lingual diversification among Palestinians that exceeds experiences in Arabic- and English-speaking locations. Ebileeni suggest a polylingual branch that entails works by Palestinian authors - or authors of Palestinian descent - written in English as well as Italian, Spanish, Danish, Hebrew and several other languages.\n\nPalestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers like Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian \"collective identity\" and the \"just case\" of their struggle. There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have \"rebelled\" against the demand that their art be \"committed\". Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that \"poetry is not a civil servant, it's not a soldier, it's in nobody's employ.\" Rula Jebreal's novel Miral tells the story of Hind Husseini's effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the Deir Yassin Massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nNovels and short stories\nSusan Abulhawas book Mornings in Jenin tells the story of a Palestinian family lost their homes during the 1948 war. In A Rift in Time author  Raja Shehadeh explored the relationship between the decline of the Ottoman Empire, British colonialism and Palestinian self-identity in a novel about his great-uncle Najib Nassar.\nShort stories in Palestinian literature started with writers like Samira Azam.\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry, using classic pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town.\n\nAfter the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel and after the passage of the Citizenship Law of 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad.\n\nThe work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon published an anthology of their work in 1966.\n\nThe work of Nathalie Handal  an award-winning poet, playwright, and writer appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines. She has been translated into twelve languages. She has promoted international literature through translation, research, and the edited The Poetry of Arab Women, an anthology that introduced several Arab women poets to a wider audience in the west.\n\nPalestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. In a poem about the Israeli bombing of Lebanon, published in the Palestinian literary magazine al-Karmel, Mahmoud Darwish wrote:\nSmoke rises from me, I reach out a hand to collect my limbs scattered from so many bodies, besieged from land and sky and sea and language. The last plane has taken off from Beirut airport and left me in front of the screen to watch\nwith millions of viewers\nthe rest of my death \nAs for my heart, I see it roll, like a pine cone, from Mount Lebanon, to Gaza.\n\nHakawati\nThe art of story telling was for a long time part of the cultural life in Arabic speaking countries of the Middle East. The tradition of \u201cTales From a Thousand and One Nights\u201d is not an exception. In each small town or village of Palestine, itinerant story tellers called hakawati would visit and tell folk stories they knew, often in teahouses. The tales of the hakawati, once told for all ages, are now sometimes emerging from the Palestinian diaspora as children's books.\n\nSee also\n Palestine Festival of Literature\n Palestinian art\n Palestinian handicrafts\n Palestinian music\n Palestinian National Theatre\n Speak, Bird, Speak Again\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional references\n Alvarado-Larroucau, Carlos, \u00c9critures palestiniennes francophones ; Qu\u00eate d\u2019identit\u00e9 en espace n\u00e9ocolonial, Paris, \u00c9ditions L\u2019Harmattan, coll. \u00ab Critiques litt\u00e9raires \u00bb, 2009.\n\nExternal links\nReview of the anthology Qissat: Short Stories by Palestinian Women\nGoogle Books Sonia Nimr, Hannah Shaw, Ghada Karmi (2008) \u201cGhaddar the Ghoul and Other Palestinian Stories\u201d, frances lincoln ltd, \nPalestinian Literature: News and Reviews at IMEU.net\nMornings in Jenin by Susan Abulhawa review\n\n \nLiterature by ethnicity", "machine_abstract": "The following is the list of notable Palestinian writers, poets and novelists who have contributed to Arab or international literary culture in various languages.\nList of authors by nationality\n\n* Authors are listed alphabetically according to their last names", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Palestinian literature\".

On leaving Georgetown, Morris entered the Jesuit novitiate at Frederick, Maryland, to prepare himself for the Catholic priesthood. However, the death of his father left him the sole support of his mother and sisters and he thereafter pursued the study of law. He read law in 1863 and subsequently entered private practice in Baltimore, Maryland from 1864 to 1867. He continued private practice in Washington, D.C. from 1867 to 1893. He was, including concurrently with his later federal judicial service, a Professor at Georgetown Law from 1876 to 1909, serving as Dean of that institution from 1891 to 1896. Morris was one of the founders of Georgetown Law in 1870, alongside Charles W. Hoffman, Hubley Ashton, and Charles James.\n\nFederal judicial service\n\nMorris was nominated by President Grover Cleveland on April 14, 1893, to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), to a new Associate Justice seat authorized by 27 Stat. 434. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 15, 1893, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on June 30, 1905, due to his retirement.\n\nHonor\n\nMorris received the honorary degree Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Georgetown University in 1877.\n\nPublication\n\nMorris wrote \"Lectures on the History of the Development of Constitutional and Civil Liberty\" in 1908.\n\nDeath\n\nMorris died on September 12, 1909, in Washington, D.C.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n\n1834 births\n1909 deaths\nGeorgetown University alumni\nMaryland lawyers\nJudges of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.

In this style, the painter avoids strongly defined outlines, with shapes indicated by colour washes in lighter and darker tones.  \n\nThe work slowly reveals itself to the viewer.  Emerging from the undefined forms is the suggestion of misty mountains in the background.  In the foreground are cliffs and bushes, and the triangular roofline and sloping banner for a wine shop with vertical lines forming a fence.

It bears a dedicatory inscription by the artist, dating it to the middle of the third month in the fourth year of the Mei\u014d era (that is, April or May 1495), when Sessh\u016b was aged 76.  It was presented to Sessh\u016b's pupil Josui S\u014den, at his request, as a physical demonstration that he had studied under Sessh\u016b in Su\u014d Province (now in Yamaguchi Prefecture).  As an indication of the artistic heritage passed on to his pupil, Sessh\u016b wrote on the scroll that he had travelled to China where he said he had studied the works of Li Zai and Zhang Yousheng, and had studied in Japan with Tensho Shubun, who was a pupil of Taik\u014d Josetsu. It is unlikely that he actually met Li Zai, however, as the latter died a considerable time before Sessh\u016b's visit to China.\n \nOn his journey home to Engaku-ji in Kamakura, Josui S\u014den stopped in Kyoto, where he asked six Zen monks from Gozan temples to add poems to the scroll.\n\nA similar work by Sessh\u016b is held by the Cleveland Museum of Art, with another at the Idemitsu Museum of Arts in Tokyo.\n\nSee also\n List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Landscape.

It serves grades nine through twelve and was established in 1926.\n\nGeneral information\nKohala High School is located in Kapaau in Hawaii County on the Island of Hawaii.  The campus is at 54-3611 Akoni Pule Highway, adjacent to Kohala Elementary School. The mascot is the Cowboys and its school colors are black and gold.\n\nHistory\nKohala School was started in 1926 for students from the North Kohala Coastal Sugar Cane Communities. The high school was established a few years later at its current location.\n\nThe school, originally known as Kohala High & Elementary, was located at its original location, now the location of Kohala Middle School in Halaula. In the 1930s, the High School was relocated to its current location due to enrollment growth, but remained Kohala High & Elementary School. In the late 1950s, a new elementary school campus was built adjacent to the high school. A few years later, most of the old high school buildings were demolished and rebuilt, appearing almost identical to the elementary campus buildings. The only buildings that were not demolished were the gymnasium and a classroom building adjacent to the gymnasium. In 1971, a new cafeteria was constructed servicing both the high school and the elementary school. In the early 2000s, the school was broken up into Kohala High School, Kohala Middle School and Kohala Elementary School. Kohala High School's rival is Honokaa High & Intermediate School.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Kohala High School Official Website\n Kohala School Info by Hawaii DOE\n\nEducational institutions established in 1926\nPublic high schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii\n1926 establishments in Hawaii", "machine_abstract": "K\u014dhala\u02bbula \u02bb\u0100ina o Hawai\u02bbi (KHSA) is the only public high school in Hawaii County, serving students from grades 9 through 12 and located on Oahu's North Shore at Kailua-Kona.

He was the son of Henrik Horn (1578-1618) and was born two months after the father's death. During his youth, the city of Stade came under the rule of Sweden possession in 1628. Stade was held by the Danish from 1636 until reverting to Swedish control in 1643. Horn received a military education and pursued a military career in the service of the Royal Swedish Army. At the age of 25, he was appointed Colonel. Horn became Major General in 1654, General Lieutenant and Chief of the Finnish Army in 1657 and Field Marshal in 1665. He distinguished himself in the Polish campaign and in 1666 was appointed Governor-General of Bremen-Verden which was under a Personal union with Sweden from \u20131712.\n\nAs Governor-General he commanded Swedish forces in 1675/76 against the allied German armies during the Bremen-Verden Campaign, but eventually had to surrender. He was given the command of the Royal Swedish Navy in 1677 and was made a member of the Privy Council of Sweden (riksr\u00e5d). That same year, he was defeated by Denmark in the Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay during the Scanian War. He was appointed to the head of the College of Amiralities in 1677. In 1678, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Livonia which was a dominion of the Swedish Empire from 1629 until 1721. In 1680, Horn left Livonia and returned to help rebuild Stade which had been besieged in 1676 during the Swedish-Brandenburg War.\n\nPersonal life\nHorn married in 1674 with Beata Magdalena Wittenberg.\n\nHe died during 1693 in Stade.\n\nSee also\nHorn family\n\nReferences\n\nOther Sources\nHorn, Henrik in Nationalencyklopedin (1992).\n\n1618 births\n1693 deaths\nPeople from Stade\nSwedish nobility\nSwedish generals\n17th-century Swedish politicians\nSwedish admirals\n17th-century Swedish military personnel", "machine_abstract": "Henrik Horn (born 16 May 1977 in Halden) is a Norwegian former footballer who played as midfielder and striker, mainly at the lower levels of the game.\nHorn made his debut playing for L\u00f8renskog IK on 1 September 1998 against Sandefjord Fotball IF.

Records in November 2020.\n\nBackground\nA sequel to the Dear Friends album, it consists of short, highly improvisational sketches distilled from the 80-hour archive set Duke of Madness Motors, originally recorded from 1970 to 1972 as part of the group's nationally syndicated Dear Friends radio show.  The album was released on vinyl and digital formats, and includes liner notes with an archive of handwritten scripts and other material from the era.\n\nReaction from members\nFiresign member David Ossman called Dope Humor a sort of \"dark side\" to the Dear Friends album, since both were compiled from the same source, but the sketches on Dope Humor had not been constrained by the desire to keep the material radio-friendly, as had been the case for Dear Friends. Phil Proctor called it a tribute to late founding members Phil Austin and Peter Bergman.\n\nReception\nMark Lynch, host of the WICN radio program Inquiry, praised the album as \"wicked funny\" and said that the humor was both a snapshot of its era and surprisingly timely in the modern era. Rich Kimball of Bangor, Maine radio station WZON said the album was full of \"lost gems\" that still seemed resonant: \"So much of it holds up ... I feel like I could hear it on some cable news networks today and it would fit right in.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide one\n\"Shakespeare Sunday Sunday\" \u2013 0:51\n\"Pig Science\" \u2013 3:15\n\"Truth & Consequences\" \u2013 4:28\n\"Clayton Rumcake\" \u2013 2:34\n\"Mary Warner\" \u2013 1:48\n\"Hawaii\" \u2013 2:18\n\"Jesus' Ascension Into Bakersfield\" \u2013 2:32\n\"Timmy's Birthday\" \u2013 3:11\n\nSide two\n\"Sex Jail!\" \u2013 1:14\n\"Rules\" \u2013 1:12\n\"Drug Abuse Expert\" \u2013 1:56\n\"Pluto Water\" \u2013 5:48\n\"Bluff\" \u2013 3:03\n\"Smoke Spud\" \u2013 0:55\n\"Vince Tomaine's Leg-o-the-Crow\" \u2013 1:43\n\"Bob Dog Dog & Dog Hot Dog Son & Foot Tires\" \u2013 1:05\n\"Fiji\" \u2013 3:43\n\nSide three\n\"Speed Kills\" \u2013 0:31\n\"Funny-Name Club Of America\" \u2013 1:45\n\"Family Bund Meeting\" \u2013 3:32\n\"The Diaphragm\" \u2013 3:36\n\"A Girl Named Bradley\" \u2013 1:44\n\"The Money Song\" \u2013 0:52\n\"Multiple Identity\" \u2013 2:19\n\"Radio Prison In Peace And War\" \u2013 6:10\n\nSide four\n\"Louis Marshman Editorial\" \u2013 3:32\n\"The Darkening Of The Light\" \u2013 1:03\n\"Railroad Sunrise\" \u2013 2:41\n\"Trashman Rap\" \u2013 1:16\n\"Channel 18 News\" \u2013 3:18\n\"Dope Humor Of The Seventies\" \u2013 1:50\n\"K's Mart\" \u2013 1:50\n\"Bird Of Prey Motors\" \u2013 1:21\n\"Loons\" \u2013 3:22\n\nReferences\n\n2020 compilation albums\nThe Firesign Theatre albums\nStand Up!

Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise as \"anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful.\"\n\nCap was the most bickered eating club in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. It has been the most selective club since 2013, with 287 students bickering in Spring 2019, thirty-five percent of whom were offered membership.\n\nHistory\nCap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to have stayed in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today.  A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, the Cap and Gown Club Board of Trustees unanimously approved a new financial aid policy that provides a grant to every member of Princeton University financial aid, guaranteeing that no member on full financial aid pays any out-of-pocket costs for club membership.\n\nNotable Cap and Gown alumni include Dean Cain '88, Brooke Shields '87, and Donald Rumsfeld '54. Neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, who pioneered the concept of the brain homunculus, was also a member of Cap and Gown.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCap and Gown Club\n\nEating clubs at Princeton University\nHistoric district contributing properties in Mercer County, New Jersey", "machine_abstract": "The Cap & Gown Club is the official student organization of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri that provides students with cap-and-gown rentals as well as other services related to graduation ceremonies at WUSTL.\nHistory", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Cap and Gown Club\".

Throughout her career, King has sold over 75 million records worldwide. Billboard ranked her as the 73rd Greatest Artist of all time. Her album Tapestry was the world's best-selling album by a female artist for a quarter century, with global sales of 25 million. According to Recording Industry Association of America, King has sold 19.6 million records in the United States. She is also recognized as the most successful female songwriter of the 20th century, having written or co-written 118 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.

In 1974 King's song \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\" won Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.   She also received two more Grammys that year as co-writer/performer of songs \"I Feel The Earth Move\" and \"You've Got A Friend\"; both were nominated for Record of the Year.

He taught frequently in singing schools and served as the youngest member of the editorial board that created the 1991 Revision of The Sacred Harp, the most widely used book for Sacred Harp singing.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, DeLong was a \"traditional\" Sacred Harp singer, meaning that he became a singer by participating as a child, learning from other singers in the rural Southern singing community in which Sacred Harp music is rooted.  He related that he was carried to his first singing by his grandmother, Dollie DeLong Hudgins, at the age of six months.\n\nAccording to the web site of the 2004 Garden State Sacred Harp Singing Convention, DeLong had \"taught more than 60 singing schools throughout the U.S. and was invited to teach Sacred Harp singing in England in 2000. He also wrote articles on the history of Sacred Harp and its singers as well as producing several CDs. He participated in the recording session for the [2003] Civil War movie Cold Mountain.\" More recently, DeLong made a cameo appearance in the 2012 movie on bootlegging Lawless.\n\nDeLong served as Executive Secretary of the Sacred Harp Publishing Company, the publishers of the 1991 Edition, from 2008\u20132011. He was the composer of two songs in this volume, \"Big Creek\" (p. 494, 1986) and \"Corley\" (p. 510, 1988; arranged from John Wilson).\n\nDeLong was frequently seen at singing conventions. He taught singing schools in 28 states, plus D.C. and participated in singings in 38 states. His own singing voice, familiar to many singers, was a robust and powerful tenor.  He dedicated his life to collecting over 1500 hours of recordings from several collections. These date from 1939 to 2011.  He also had a varied collection of tune books including every \"Sacred Harp\" from 1850 to present.\n\nIn addition to his work with Sacred Harp, DeLong was a high school economics, AP US History and world history teacher in Carrollton, Georgia.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nThe Sacred Harp, 1991 revision.

{"id": "Jean Langlais", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean%20Langlais", "title": "Jean Langlais", "text": "Jean Fran\u00e7ois-Hyacinthe Langlais III (15 February 1907 \u2013 8 May 1991) was a French composer of modern classical music, organist, and improviser. He described himself as \"\" (\"Breton, of Catholic faith\"). His works include masses and organ music, some based on Gregorian themes, enhanced by polymodal harmonies, as well as music for other forces.\n\nBiography \nLanglais was born in La Fontenelle (Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany), a small village near Mont Saint-Michel, France to Jean-Marie-Joseph Langlais II, a blacksmith and Flavie Canto, a seamstress. Langlais became blind due to glaucoma when he was only two years old and was sent to the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles (National Institute for Blind Children) in Paris, where he began to study the organ, with Andr\u00e9 Marchal. From there he progressed to the Paris Conservatoire, obtaining prizes in organ and studying composition with Marcel Dupr\u00e9 and Paul Dukas. He also studied improvisation with Charles Tournemire.\n\nAfter graduating, Langlais returned to the National Institute for Blind Children to teach, and also taught at the Schola Cantorum in Paris from 1961 to 1976. Many of his students went on to become important musicians, including organists and composers; among them was the American Kathleen Thomerson, who later published a bio-bibliography about him. Langlais' first wife Jeanette asked his former student, personal recital liaison and friend Ann Labounsky in 1972 to write Langlais' biography Jean Langlais the Man and His Music, though it was not published until 2000; nine years after Langlais' death. Labounsky did her doctoral paper in 1991 on the life and works of Langlais and fortunately she was able to share some of it with Langlais before he died. However Langlais was displeased as Labounsky was truthful in what she saw as Langlais wanted to be painted as the way he saw his truth. Labounsky admitted that at times Langlais could be a complex person but Langlais did not see himself this way. This was partly due to the region of Brittany in which he grew up as the Bretons considered themselves to be a proud people who loved to tell folklore. \n\nIt was as an organist that Langlais made his name, following in the footsteps of C\u00e9sar Franck and Charles Tournemire as organiste titulaire at the Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde in Paris in 1945, a post in which he remained until 1988. He was much in demand as a concert organist, and widely toured across Europe and the United States.  \n\nLanglais died in the 15th arrondissement of Paris at the age of 84, and was survived by his second wife Marie-Louise Jaquet-Langlais and three children, Janine, Claude and Caroline. The position of organist at Sainte-Clotilde was succeeded to by Jacques Taddei.\n\nMusic\nLanglais was a prolific composer, composing 254 works with opus numbers, the first of which was his Prelude and Fugue for organ (1927), and the last his Trio (1990), another organ piece. Although best known as a composer of organ music and sacred choral music, he also composed a number of instrumental, orchestral and chamber works and some secular song settings.\n\nLanglais' music is written in a highly individual eclectic  style, venturing well beyond what might be expected of mid-twentieth-century French music, with rich and complex harmonies and overlapping modes, sometimes more tonal than his contemporary, friend and countryman Olivier Messiaen, sometimes related to his two predecessors at Sainte-Clotilde, Franck and Tournemire, but sometimes also employing serial techniques and often exhibiting an earthy, Celtic folkiness which owes not a little to Bartok: \"\" as one early reviewer wrote.\n\nHis best-known works include his four-part masses, Messe solennelle and Missa Salve Regina, his Missa in simplicitate for unison voice and organ, and his many organ compositions, including:\nHymne d'actions de gr\u00e2ces from Three Gregorian Paraphrases\nLa nativit\u00e9 and Les rameaux (The Palms) (Po\u00e8mes Evangeliques)\nChant h\u00e9ro\u00efque, Chant de paix, and De profundis from Nine Pieces\nKyrie \"Orbis factor\"  from Livre \u0153cum\u00e9nique\nIncantation pour un jour saint (Incantation for Easter)\nCantilene (Suite br\u00e8ve)\nSuite m\u00e9di\u00e9vale\nFolkloric Suite\nTrois m\u00e9ditations sur la Sainte Trinit\u00e9\nF\u00eate, Op. 51\n24 Pieces for harmonium or organ, Op. 6\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n Langlais joue Langlais, 1976\n Missa Salve Regina; Messe solennelle, (English Chamber Orchestra Brass Ensemble; The Choir of Westminster Cathedral/David Hill), 1988\n Jean Langlais Live, St. Augustin, Wien, 1993\n Organ works (Kevin Bowyer), 1994\n Messe solennelle - Missa in Simplicitate - Missa Misericordiae Domini - Ensemble Vocal Jean Sourisse, dir.

She was a daughter of Leroy Robertson and has written scholarly analyses of his works.\n\nLife and musical career\nRobertson was born in Morgan, Utah, and initially studied piano. At age ten, when her younger sister was born, her father bought a half-size cello that was allegedly for the newborn Karen but her father urged her to play it until her sister became big enough. She joined the Utah Symphony Orchestra in 1947. In 1950 she went to study in France on a Fulbright scholarship; that year her father wrote a cello composition for her to play.\n\nMarian Robertson married W. Keith Wilson, a retired Utah probation officer, in San Francisco in 1979. Their marriage was later solemnized in the Salt Lake Temple. He died in 1994.\n\nWilson held two Ph.D.s, one in French and music and the other in Arabic.  At least one of these Ph.D.s was from the University of Utah. Over a 21-year period she taught a wide variety of courses including French, Greek, Italian, German, Music theory and cello at various times at Brigham Young University, the University of Utah and Utah State University.\n\nBesides being the music editor for the Coptic Encyclopedia, Wilson also created a guide to the Library of Congress's collection of Coptic music. Since 1971, she has been closely connected with the work of the Leroy Robertson foundation which awards scholarships to young composers to aid them in furthering their education.\n\nWilson wrote a biography of her father entitled Leroy Robertson: Music Giant From the Rockies.  It received the Association for Mormon Letters award for Best biography in 1997.\n\nWilson died on Monday, April 8, 2013 in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional sources\n\n \n \n Neal A.

He was later loaned to \u017delezni\u010dar Smederevo in order to gain experience. Later on, Rankovi\u0107 also spent some time at Dubo\u010dica while serving his military duty in Leskovac.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Rankovi\u0107 returned to Sartid and played three games in the 2000\u201301 season. He also sat on the bench in all four matches in the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, with the arrival of Dragan \u017dili\u0107 and Neboj\u0161a Mileki\u0107, Rankovi\u0107 was sent out on loan to Bosnian side Slavija Sarajevo for the rest of the 2001\u201302 season.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Rankovi\u0107 made another return to Sartid and became a member of the squad that won the Serbia and Montenegro Cup in the 2002\u201303 season. He began receiving more playing time after the departure of \u017dili\u0107 in the summer of 2004. Following the club's relegation from the top flight in 2008, Rankovi\u0107 established himself as the team's first-choice goalkeeper and helped them earn promotion back straight away. He continued playing regularly for the side over the next three seasons.\n\nLater career\nIn July 2012, Rankovi\u0107 moved to fellow Serbian SuperLiga club Sloboda U\u017eice on a free transfer. He missed just one league game in the 2012\u201313 season, as the team narrowly fell out of a UEFA Europa League spot. In the following campaign, Rankovi\u0107 again missed just one league match, but failed to help the side avoid relegation from the top flight.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 seasons, Rankovi\u0107 played regularly for Serbian First League club Sloga Petrovac.\n\nPersonal life\nNicknamed \u0160nicla (Serbian for \"schnitzel\"), Rankovi\u0107 is a car mechanic, owning and maintaining an oldsmobile from 1968.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\nSartid Smederevo\n Serbia and Montenegro Cup: 2002\u201303\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\nAssociation football goalkeepers\nExpatriate footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nFirst League of Serbia and Montenegro players\nFK Dubo\u010dica players\nFK Slavija Sarajevo players\nFK Sloboda U\u017eice players\nFK Sloga Petrovac na Mlavi players\nFK Smederevo players\nSerbia and Montenegro expatriate footballers\nSerbia and Montenegro expatriate sportspeople in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nSerbia and Montenegro footballers\nSerbian First League players\nSerbian footballers\nSerbian SuperLiga players\nSportspeople from Smederevo\n1976 births\nLiving people", "machine_abstract": "Dejan Rankovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0435\u0458\u0430\u043d \u0420\u0430\u045a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; born September 16, 1974) is a Serbian professional football player who currently plays as defender/midfielder in the Premier League 2 club Chesterfield on loan from Championship side Blackburn Rovers until January 2013", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Dejan Rankovi\u0107\".

{"id": "Ancestral home (Chinese)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral%20home%20%28Chinese%29", "title": "Ancestral home (Chinese)", "text": "In Chinese culture, hometown or ancestral home () is the place of origin of one's extended family. It may or may not be the place where one is born.\n\nFor instance, physicists Tsung-Dao Lee (Nobelist, 1957) and Charles Kao (nobelist, 2009) were both born in Shanghai, but their hometowns are considered to be Suzhou and Jinshan, respectively.\n\nDefinition \nA subjective concept, a person's ancestral home could be the birthplace of any of their patriline ancestors. Su Shi limited it to five generations, i.e. it refers to the home of one's great-great-grandfather. Even more broadly, an ancestral home can refer to the first locality where a surname came to be established or prominent. Commonly, a person usually defines their hometown as what their father considers to be his ancestral home. In practice, most people would define their ancestral homes as the birthplace of their patriline ancestors from the early 20th century, around the time when government authorities began to collect such information from individuals.\n\nMoreover, a person's ancestral home can be defined in any level of locality, from province and county down to town and village, depending on how much an individual knows about their ancestry.\n\nImplications \nThe Chinese emphasis on a person's ancestral home is a legacy of its history as an agrarian society, where a family would often be tied to its land for generations. In Chinese culture, the importance of family and regional identity are such that a person's ancestral home or birthplace plays an important social role in personal identity. For instance, at a university, students who hail from the same region will often become members of the regional/hometown society or club for other people with the same background. Discussion of personal or ancestral origins is typical when two people meet for the first time. In recent years, the root-seeking (\u5c0b\u6839 x\u00fang\u0113n) movement has led to greater interest in ancestral hometowns, especially among overseas Chinese.\n\nAncestral lineages are an important part of Chinese business culture as it plays a central part of negotiating guanxi. It can also have implications in other areas like politics. See: Shanghainese people in Hong Kong for an example of how ancestry and lineage systems play a part in business practices.\n\nAncestral home is an item to be filled in many documents in the People's Republic of China Forms that required listing of \"ancestral home\" (\u7c4d\u8cab) included school handbooks to be signed by the parents of schoolchildren.\n\nTaiwan \nNational ID cards issued in Taiwan by the Republic of China government formerly carried an entry for \"home citizenship\" (\u672c\u7c4d). Citizens would usually have their ancestral home (defined through the patriline) stated on these documents, despite having never set foot in their ancestral home. This practice was abolished by the government in the mid-1990s amid the Taiwan localization movement.\n\nSee also \n\nChinese kin\n Chinese ancestral worship\n Ancestral shrine & Ancestor tablets\nHukou system\nFamily register\nRegistered domicile\nPlace of origin\nBon-gwan\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links \n\u7c4d\u8cab (zik6 gun3 | ji2 guan4) : ancestral land; native place - CantoDict\n\nChinese culture", "machine_abstract": "Ancestral home is the place where ancestors lived and died, or were buried in China.\nThe ancestral home was traditionally located at the center of family life; it served as both a living space and a burial site.

{"id": "Michelstadt", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelstadt", "title": "Michelstadt", "text": "Michelstadt () in the Odenwald is a town in the Odenwaldkreis (district) in southern Hesse, Germany between Darmstadt and Heidelberg. It has a population of around 16,000.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation \nMichelstadt is the biggest town in the Odenwaldkreis and borders on the district seat of Erbach.\n\nNeighbouring municipalities \nMichelstadt borders in the north on the municipality of Brombachtal, the town of Bad K\u00f6nig and the municipality of L\u00fctzelbach, in the east on the town of Klingenberg, the market municipalities of Laudenbach and Kleinheubach, the town of Miltenberg, the market municipality of Weilbach, the town of Amorbach and the market municipality of Kirchzell (all seven in Miltenberg district in Bavaria), in the south on the town of Erbach, and in the west on the municipalities of Mossautal and Reichelsheim.\n\nConstituent communities \nMichelstadt's Stadtteile, besides the main town, also called Michelstadt, are Rehbach, Steinbach, Steinbuch, Stockheim, Vielbrunn, Weiten-Ges\u00e4\u00df and W\u00fcrzberg.\n\nHistory \nThe first documentary mention of Michelstadt is from 741, noted by Carloman, who was Charlemagne\u2019s uncle and Mayor of the Palace.<ref>Dictionary of Literary Biography, volume 148, German Writers and Works of the Early Middle Ages: 800-1170, edited by James Hardin and Will Hasty, 1994, pp. 27-31.</ref>\n\nMichelstadt is one of the oldest settlements in the inner Odenwald. Its castle grew out of a Frankish baronial estate. This was built into a refuge for the local inhabitants. As a royal estate, Prince Carloman donated it in 741 to Saint Boniface\u2019s pupil Burchard, the first Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg. This donation was apparently meant for Bishop Burchard personally, for the Michelnstat area passed back to the Frankish Crown upon Burchard\u2019s death in 791.\n\nIn 815, the Michlinstat area was donated once again. In recognition of his great merit as confidant at Charlemagne\u2019s court, Einhard acquired the main town and all land within two leagues (roughly 15\u00a0km) from Charlemagne\u2019s son, Louis the Pious, as a freehold. Einhard also built the Einhardsbasilika. In 819, he bequeathed his Odenwald holdings to Lorsch Abbey and in so doing precisely defined the boundaries of the Mark Michelstadt. Upon Einhard\u2019s death on 14 March 840, the monastery came into its inheritance.\n\nIn the 17th century, the first houses outside the town wall were built. In 1773, a new town gate was built, called the Neutor' (\u201cNew Gate\u201d). In the 19th century, the gate towers were all torn down one after the other.\n\nIn 1806, Michelstadt, as within the County of Erbach, passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.\n\nThe building of the railway line and its completion through to Darmstadt in 1870 and then Eberbach in 1881 brought Michelstadt a sharp economic upswing. Out of what was once a small farming community grew a sizeable town with important industrial operations on the foundation of the centuries-old ironworking. A new economic era began. From the clothweavers\u2019 and dyers\u2019 guild grew a cloth factory; from foundries grew machine factories. Ivory carving was a starting point for businesses in the souvenir industry and plastics processing.\n\nIn 1962, the town hosted the second Hessentag state festival.\n\nIn 2007, a decision to merge the town with the neighbouring town of Erbach was thwarted by a civic vote.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe municipal elections held 2006 and 2016 yielded the following results:\n\nMayor \nList of elected mayors of Michelstadt:\n1997\u20132009: Reinhold Ruhr\n2009\u20132021: Stephan Kelbert\n2021\u2013incumbent: Tobias Robischon\n\nTown partnerships \n Rumilly, Haute-Savoie, France\n Hulst, Zeelandic Flanders, Netherlands\n\nCoat of arms \n\nThe town's arms might be described as per fess azure two mullets.\n\nMichelstadt was granted these arms in 1541 along with its new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. The diapering in the lower half of the escutcheon is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it. The mullets (six-pointed star shapes) come from the Counts' arms, but why the parting per fess (horizontal division across the middle) was chosen is a mystery. Except for diapering, the arms have not changed since the 16th century.\n\nEconomy\n\nNotable companies \n M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, a manufacturer of railbound and trackless tunnel construction equipment.\n\nArts and culture\n\nTheatre \nKleinkunstb\u00fchne Patat (cabaret)\nMichelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer, yearly open-air plays in the historic Kellereihof\nTheaterkarren e.V.

Particularly worthy of mention are the following buildings, some within the old town, others in the surrounding countryside: The historic Town Hall, the Diebsturm (\"Thief's Tower\") at the town wall, the Kellereihof (a Frankish, early mediaeval castle complex refurbished in an early Renaissance style) in the town wall ring, the late Gothic town church (late 13th century), the Einhards-Basilika, the palace of the Counts at Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau (Schloss F\u00fcrstenau, within which are parts of an old moated castle in Michelstadt-Steinbach), Jagdschloss Eulbach with an English landscape garden and a Roman bath and castra, formerly part of the Neckar-Odenwald Limes.\n\nHistoric Town Hall \n\nMichelstadt's timber-frame town hall, whose image was used on a Deutsche Post stamp, was built in 1484 in the late Gothic style and later remodelled on the inside many times; from 1743 to 1903 it was covered in shakes. The town hall's main floor served from the beginning as a market hall, and was built using jettying. The back (east) wall was originally part of the graveyard wall, upon which the ground floor's upper bressumer was laid. To this day it is unknown who the master builder was, although it is assumed that the driving force behind the project could have been Schenk Adolar von Erbach and Bishop Johann von Dalberg (his adviser).\n\nLate Gothic town church \nThe town church, completed in 1490, was built to replace a Carolingian stone church by Einhard, itself built on the site of a former wooden church. The nave's columns and the two aisles' walls were built in 1475. The quire dates from 1461; the antechoir's north wall is even older \u2013 Carolingian. Until the 1970s, the church housed one of the most valuable libraries in Germany in its belltower containing more than a thousand volumes belonging to Michelstadt-born Nicolaus Matz, who was capitular in Speyer, and who bequeathed this collection to his hometown and its citizens in the late 14th century. Since the 1970s the library has been housed in a storehouse specially converted for it at the Michelstadt coaching inn that belonged to the Thurn und Taxis noble family, who played a key r\u00f4le in European postal services in the 16th century. The former church on this spot was built over a brook that comes up here, called the Kiliansflo\u00df, an early Celtic-Germanic worship site and later a Roman Mithraic worship site. The thus channelled Kiliansflo\u00df fed not only the baptismal font, but also all the town's fountains. The Kiliansflo\u00df, however, does not actually rise here, but rather far outside the town. It then disappears into the ground not far from the graveyard, springing up again in the middle of town.\n\nEinhard's Basilica in the outlying centre of Steinbach\n\nThe Einhards-Basilika was built by Einhard, Charlemagne's chronicler and confidant. The Carolingian church built between 824 and 827 is one of the very few Carolingian buildings that have survived largely intact. The Basilica's crypt once housed Saints Peter's and Marcellinus's relics, which had been stolen from Rome on Einhard's instructions by his notary Ratleik. His servants' nightmares and the remains' \"sweating blood\" there, however, made Einhard think that this arrangement did not feel right. He thus transferred himself, his wife, the relics and his seat to Ober-Mulinheim am Main, now known as Seligenstadt, which thereby became a pilgrimage site with a new, larger basilica.\n\nThe story that has been handed down says that the relics hidden from Rome were transported to Saint-Maurice-en-Valais, now in Switzerland, whence they were then brought to Michelstadt by a cheering pilgrimage procession.\n\nThe Basilica in Steinbach was converted, expanded, and rededicated many times and later served first as a hospital and then in the 17th century as a barn. Once it was rediscovered in 1873 as being Carolingian, the exploration and safeguarding of the parts of the basilica that were still intact began.\n\nThe Einhards-Basilika was until 1967 owned by the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau. The grounds are now owned by the state of Hesse.\n\nThe palace of the Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau in the outlying centre of Steinbach \n\nThe palace complex is a series of building styles which includes remains of the old Electorate of Mainz border fortifications and moated castle (about 1300) on the north side to the Gothic works by the stonecutters who came from Strasbourg to Steinbach, to the gigantic Renaissance-style gateway arch (1588) between the moated castle's two western corner towers which replaced the castle wall and opened the gloomy, dank courtyard back up to the former castle garden, to the Renaissance palace mill, a former mint (today a run-of-the-river hydroelectric station), to the Baroque Kavaliershaus (a palace outbuilding for staff and guests) on the M\u00fcmling, to the Neoclassical residential wing, the Neues Palais (1810/11) and the late Baroque orangery in the palace park, which was built in the English style. The orangery's upper floor housed the small palace theatre.\n\nSchloss F\u00fcrstenau is still a dwelling, with the head of the house of the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau and his family still living there. The former Electorate of Mainz defence facility lay on the property of the Schenk of Erbach (a forefather of the noble family, which at that time had not yet branched) and passed into his ownership in 1355. Public access to the ground and is possible by day. At the outer bailey with its gateway arch from 1765 some visual artists have taken up residence (in among other places the former stables from after 1765).\n\nRoman bath and castra \nRight near W\u00fcrzberg, in the middle of a clearing are found the remains of the Roman Castrum of W\u00fcrzberg, which was built about AD 100 as part of the Neckar-Odenwald-Limes, and was used for about 60 years before the border was shifted farther east. The castrum can only be made out by an earthen wall. The Roman bathhouse, on the other hand, which stands right next to the castrum, has been partially restored; the floors have been replaced and the wall has been built back up to a height of about a metre. Despite the bath's small size, which was only meant for the fort's 120-man garrison, the design of a Roman bathhouse is easily recognizable.\n\nNot far from the outlying centre of Vielbrunn, in the area around the former hunting palace of the Princes of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, traces of the Castrum of Hainhaus can still be found. Furthermore, on Michelstadt's eastern outskirts can be found the Castrum of Eulbach near the Eulbacher Park, a landscaped English park from the early 19th century with its hunting palace and an adjoining wildlife park.\n\nOther structures \n W\u00fcrzberg Transmission Mast\n ESOC-Bodenstation Michelstadt (disused satellite ground receiving station)\n\nRegular events \nMichelst\u00e4dter Bienenmarkt (\"bee market\") \u2013 Held each year at Whitsun, it was started by former mayor Hasenzahl in 1954.\nMusiknacht \u2013 Each year, various concert productions take place in the Old Town with many different kinds of music.\nChurch Consecration Festival with Weinbrunnenfest \u2013 From the Old Town's many fountains, wine is given out by the many wine cellars and businesses at the Weinbrunnenfest (\"Wine Fountain Festival\"), which is actually Michelstadt's traditional folk festival, at which all the town's countless fountains are decorated.\nMichelstadt Christmas Market \u2013 this is still quite a new creation of the television-sponsored Stadtmarketing (\"town marketing\") of the late 1960s. The opening always takes place on the Friday before the onset of Advent. \nMichelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer \u2013 since 2003 a yearly open-air theatrical festival, initiated by the Michelstadt \"theatremakers\" Alexander Kaffenberger and Dirk Daniel Zucht.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTransport \nIn Michelstadt the two Bundesstra\u00dfen 45 and 47 intersect, both are old trade roads from Frankfurt am Main to Augsburg and from Worms to W\u00fcrzburg respectively.\n\nThe town is served by a railway station on the Odenwaldbahn (RMV Line 65; Eberbach \u2013 Erbach \u2013 Michelstadt \u2013 Darmstadt \u2013 Frankfurt / Hanau). Regionalbahn, Stadtexpress and Regionalexpress trains of the VIAS GmbH stop here.\n\nThere is also the special landing facility Flugplatz Michelstadt (airfield), which lies roughly 2\u00a0km from the town and is run by a club.\n\nEducation \n Stadtschule Michelstadt (primary school)\n Schule am Hollerbusch (primary school)\n Einhardschule (primary school in the outlying centre of Steinbach)\n Grundschule Vielbrunn (primary school)\n Theodor Litt Schule (Realschule and Hauptschule)\n Gymnasium Michelstadt\n Odenwaldkreis Vocational Schools (including, among others, Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule and Berufliches Gymnasium, nowadays known as BSO \u2013 Europaschule.\n\nNotable people \n Rolf Beck (born 1945), music conductor\n Dietrich Schenk von Erbach (d. 1459), Archbishop of Mainz (from 1434 to 1459)\n Hartmut Barth-Engelbart (pen names include Carl Hanau and HaBE, (b. 1947), author, songwriter and graphic artist\n Rebecca Horn (b. 1944), artist, film director\n Fritz Kredel (b. 8 February 1900 in Michelstadt, d. 11 June 1973 in New York), artist and graphic designer\n Gabriele von Lutzau (b. 1954), sculptor, lives and works in Michelstadt\n Alfred Maul (1870 - 1942), engineer, considered the father of aerial reconnaissance\n Dirk Mommertz (born 1974), pianist and chamber musician\n Otto Rahn (1904 - 1939),  writer, medievalist, Ariosophist, SS officer\n Stefan Seeger (b. 1962), chemist, university professor and entrepreneur\n Jessica Schwarz (b. 1977), moderator and actress\n Carl Weyprecht (1838 - 1881), explorer\n Seckel L\u00f6b Wormser (b. 1768 in Michelstadt, d. 1847 in Michelstadt), Kabbalist\n\nFurther reading \n Wolfgang Hartmann: Zu den fr\u00fchen urkundlichen Erw\u00e4hnungen von Michelstadt im Odenwald.

{"id": "Daycroft School", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daycroft%20School", "title": "Daycroft School", "text": "The Daycroft School was a co-educational private boarding school founded in 1928. Initially located at a private home in Darien, Connecticut, it relocated to Stamford in 1935, and in 1963, to the neighboring town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Relocating again in Greenwich, it eventually occupied the Rosemary Hall campus from 1971 until Daycroft's closing in 1991. Smart founded the school for the children of local Christian Scientists.\n\nSchool history \nDaycroft was founded by Sarah Pyle Smart as a private school for the children of area Christian Scientists so they could be educated in an environment akin to their home life, where the teachings of Christian Science were \"an integral part\" of life. To that end, the faculty were all members of The Mother Church. Admission to the school was restricted to the children of parents who were students of Christian Science. The school had no official tie with the Christian Science Church. In later years, admission was extended to those had a close relative who was a member of The Mother Church or one of its branch churches.\n\nThe school was a member of the Secondary Education Board and offered pre-school through high school, in general subjects and college preparatory education. The school offered partial scholarships and was incorporated in 1939 as a non-profit institution.\n\nThe school's initial home was in Darien, Connecticut, where the Smarts lived. In 1935, a portion of an estate was purchased on Noroton Hill, near the  Stamford Cove and became the new home for the school. The 46-acre Stamford campus was sold to Clairol in 1963, when the school moved to the Rock Ridge area of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1971, the school moved to the former Rosemary Hall campus, also in Rock Ridge. In 1998, the campus was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its architectural significance. Its chapel was designed in the Middle English Gothic style by Theodore E. Blake of Carr\u00e8re & Hastings.\n\nPolio outbreak \nIn 1972, the Daycroft school was one of the last sites of a polio outbreak in the United States. Due to their Christian Science belief, very few students at the school were immunized for polio. The outbreak prompted an emergency quarantine and mass immunization, which successfully prevented polio from spreading to the rest of the state. Ultimately, at least 11 school children (9 boys and 2 girls) were stricken by the paralytic form of the disease.\n\nNotable alumni and staff \nRichard Bergenheim\nJacqueline Moss\nZack Snyder\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDaycroft School Foundation\nCS e-News Spotlight\n\nSchools in Fairfield County, Connecticut\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nChristian Science in the United States\nChristian Science in Connecticut\nFormer Christian Science churches, societies and buildings in the United States\nEducational institutions established in 1928\n1928 establishments in Connecticut", "machine_abstract": "Founded in 1660, Daycroft is one of the oldest schools in England and Wales.\nThe school was founded by John Croft as a free grammar school to educate poor boys from Bristol; it became known locally as \"The King's School at Daycroft\" or simply \"King's School\".

{"id": "West London Orbital", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20London%20Orbital", "title": "West London Orbital", "text": "The West London Orbital is a proposed extension to the London Overground railway system in London, UK. The extension would make use of a combination of existing freight and passenger lines including the Dudding Hill Line, North London Line and Hounslow Loop. The route would run for approximately 11 miles (17\u00a0km) from  and  at the northern end to  at the western end via , Neasden, Harlesden, , South Acton and .\n\nIf the extension were opened, it would improve rail connectivity across West and North-West London and establish a number of new connections to existing radial rail infrastructure including Thameslink, the Jubilee line, the Bakerloo line, High Speed 2, Crossrail and the Piccadilly line. It is anticipated the line would be operational by the mid-2020s, due to the fact that it makes use of existing underused rail infrastructure rather than requiring significant lengths of new track or tunnels to be built. The planned line would follow a portion of the route of the former Super Outer Circle that was operated by the Midland Railway from 1878 to 1880.\n\nThe scheme is supported by the Mayor and Transport for London's Transport Strategy; it is still at the proposal stage, although TfL published a business case for the plans in August 2019.\n\nDetail of the scheme\n\nThe West London Orbital line consists of a number of distinct sections: The Dudding Hill Line, the North London Line and the Hounslow Loop. The Dudding Hill line itself has had no scheduled passenger service for over a century. It has no stations, no electrification and a  speed limit with semaphore signalling, and is lightly used by freight and very occasional passenger charter trains. It is roughly  long.\n\nNear the site of  the West London Orbital would connect to the existing North London Line, and then further south at Acton, use the link down to the Hounslow Loop to reach  and . Taken together, this set of routes would be known as the \u201cWest London Orbital\u201d railway.\n\nIn March 2017 the West London Alliance group of local authorities commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of the line so that a decision could be taken as to whether it merited pursuing further. This study found that:\n\n The route is technically feasible.\n The scheme represents a high value for money, with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.2.\n Peak three-hour demand at 3,000 passengers southbound and 2,500 passengers northbound in 2031. This suggests that the level of passenger demand may be able to sustain a regular four-trains-per-hour or more service along the line. \n The line would enable significant new development to be undertaken along its length, supporting the creation of new homes and jobs.\n It would drastically improve orbital travel times around West London compared with the equivalent journey by car. For example, a journey from Barnet to Park Royal (enabling a change on to Crossrail or HS2 services) would take approximately  minutes. A trip from Acton to Cricklewood or Brent Cross would take approximately  minutes. A journey along the whole line from Barnet to Hounslow would take approximately 39 minutes (times the same for reverse journeys). \n Eight trains per hour in each direction would be achievable given existing traffic along the length of the route.\n It would connect town centres and regeneration areas, including the 45,000 new homes and 86,000 new jobs that will be created at Old Oak Common, Wembley and Brent Cross regeneration areas, putting a greater number of jobs and homes within easy reach of one another and supporting intensification in growth areas.\n It would remove a significant number of cars from the road, reducing congestion and improving journey times, particularly along the North Circular Road, as the population of London approaches 10 million over the next 20 years. \n It would allow passengers in outer London to access new services on Crossrail and HS2 via an interchange at .\n Potential to unlock significant amount of new housing.\n It would help to reduce passenger demand for central London stations such as King's Cross and  for orbital journeys that currently require travellers to go into central London before then travelling back out to reach their destination.\nIn June 2017 Transport for London published the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which stated that London government would work with the relevant boroughs to explore the feasibility of the proposed service, that would become the West London Orbital. In March 2018 the Mayor's Transport Strategy was published, which includes a proposal for this orbital connection to Old Oak between Hounslow and Brent Cross.\n\nCurrent position \n{\n  \"type\":

ratified by the London Assembly on 8 March 2018, includes plans for a West London Orbital railway line under Proposal 88. The mayor's proposal for the service highlights that utilising new and existing orbital connections in west London could also improve public transport connections in the city centre.\n\nThe West London Alliance group of local authorities have expressed support for the West London Orbital Scheme, and have confirmed that it will be incorporated in to all Local Plans. Discussions are currently underway between West London councils and London government on the future of the scheme.\n\nA number of independent analyses of the scheme have been published, including by Modern Railways magazine and the independent blogging community\n\nIn April 2019, \u00a3320\u00a0million of funding was approved for a new Brent Cross West railway station, that would also serve the potential new service.\n\nIn June 2019, Transport for London published the Strategic Outline Business Case for the scheme and concluded that there was a strong case for the scheme as it had a medium to high benefit-cost ratio. TfL found that for 8 trains per hour in the core the BCR was between 1.4 and 1.8 and for 4 trains per hour it would be 1.7 to 2.0. As the scheme was found to have a strong business case, TfL stated that it intended to proceed to the next stage which will look at how the scheme can be funded. A more detailed business case is expected to be developed in the next 18 months.\n\nEarlier proposals \nA number of routes have previously been examined for new orbital tube lines and improved connectivity across West and North London. It was considered that the most likely route of the previous proposal would be a north\u2013south route running from Brent Cross to Surbiton, via Wembley Park, Ealing Broadway, Richmond and Kingston fully underground, connecting several London Underground and National Rail lines, including the forthcoming Crossrail (Elizabeth Line) at Ealing Broadway.\n\nThe proposal envisaged an underground driverless light rail train system similar to the Docklands Light Railway, and updated \"to the most modern standards\". The transit time from Brent Cross to Surbiton was quoted as 28 minutes, with a maximum train speed of .\n\nThe promoters cited a number of reasons why they believed an underground scheme would be cost-effective at \u00a31.75\u00a0billion: with lower tunnelling costs as the tunnel diameter would be smaller than for a heavy rail scheme; there are no other rail tunnels to avoid (as in central London); and the subsoil strata are suitable for modern tunnel boring machines.\n\nAn unrelated scheme of the same name was previously proposed in June 2008 by the West London Business group. That proposal involved the construction of a new underground line across West and South West London and did not progress beyond concept stage.\n\nAdditionally, Regional Eurostar proposals meant to send trains from Eurostar lines into Waterloo International station to London Heathrow Airport used parts of the orbital between Willesden Junction and Acton.\n\nAlternative orbital schemes\nA number of other notable orbital rail schemes for London have been previously proposed:\nR25 railway orbital around the Zone 3 area of London. First proposed in the Mayor of London's \u00a31.3trn London Infrastructure 2050 plan, the line would use some existing National Rail and London Overground lines, linked by stretches of new railway.\n Orbirail was a 2012 proposal for an outer \"super loop\" service roughy equivalent to a M25 for rail. The West London Orbital proposal makes use of some elements of this concept. \n The Park Royal Partnership promoted a 'FastBus' scheme of branded, limited-stop buses, between  and  stations and possibly beyond. \n The 'North and West London Light Railway' (or the 'Brent Cross Railway') is a proposed rapid transit network. The scheme was originally developed by the London group of the Campaign for Better Transport, and mainly uses existing or abandoned surface railway corridors.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nProposed rail infrastructure in London\nProposed railway lines in London", "machine_abstract": "The West London Orbital is the name of two separate railway lines in south-west England, both part of Network Rail's South Western Main Line.\nWest London Orbital (A) runs from Reading to Penzance via Bristol Temple Meads and Exeter St David's Street stations; it was opened on 1 May 1840 by the Great Western Railway as its main line between London Paddington station and Bristol.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"West London Orbital\".

{"id": "Carl Froch vs. George Groves II", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl%20Froch%20vs.%20George%20Groves%20II", "title": "Carl Froch vs. George Groves II", "text": "Carl Froch vs. George Groves II, billed as Unfinished Business and The Rematch, was a professional boxing match contested on 31 May 2014 at Wembley Stadium in London. It was a rematch of the first fight between Carl Froch and George Groves in 2013, with Froch's unified WBA (Regular) and IBF super-middleweight titles at stake as before.\n\nFroch won the fight by knockout in the eighth round, which was named the Knockout of the Year by The Ring magazine. The event drew a then-record attendance figure of 80,000 and grossed over \u00a322 million, and was named the Event of the Year by The Ring.\n\nBackground\n\nCarl Froch and George Groves first fought on 23 November 2013 at the Manchester Arena (then known as the Phones4u Arena). In that fight, Froch's two world titles were also at stake. Groves scored a surprise knockdown in the opening round and went on to build up a lead on all three judges' scorecards. In round nine, the fight ended in highly controversial circumstances when Froch managed land a series of punches to hurt Groves, which prompted referee Howard Foster to stop the fight on a technical knockout. The result was heavily protested by Groves and his team, as well as by fans and the media, creating immediate demand for a rematch.\n\nBuild-up\nThe rematch was officially announced on 4 March 2014 by Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, for whom Froch had fought since 2011 and Groves since 2013. It was the first boxing event to be held at the new Wembley Stadium since it opened in 2007; the last to be held at the old Wembley Stadium was Oliver McCall vs. Frank Bruno on 2 September 1995. A new attendance record for a British boxing event was also anticipated, which would break the previous record of 57,000 at the City of Manchester Stadium, during Ricky Hatton vs. Juan Lazcano on 24 May 2008. Froch's WBA (Regular) and IBF super-middleweight titles would again be on the line.\n\nAs with their first fight, Froch and Groves appeared on Sky Sports' boxing magazine show Ringside. In their first meeting on the show, on 8 November 2013, Groves insisted on referring to Froch by his second name only, while Froch refused to even look at him. Their second meeting, on 2 May 2014, was slightly more cordial and ended with a handshake. However, when they shook hands again on Sky's round table sit-down show, The Gloves Are Off, Groves attempted to pull Froch over the table but was himself pulled over instead. Both fights were likened to the rivalry between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank in the early 1990s. In the build-up to the rematch there was much animosity between both boxers, with copious amounts of trash-talk and each vowing to score a knockout.\n\nThe weigh-in took place on 30 May at the nearby Wembley Arena, in front of 4,000 raucous fans who were predominantly in support of native Londoner Groves. Froch came in at , a shade under the super-middleweight limit of . Groves came in at , considerably under the limit. Froch taunted Groves during the staredown, to which Groves said afterwards: \"Carl was talking and talking, [he] said I looked dry, I looked tight at the weight. He is grasping for something, he needs reassurance. I said this six months ago. He can't find it and for that reason he is going to struggle. He is gone.\"\n\nFight details\nAs part of the entrance spectacle, Groves first entered the arena on an open top bus, accompanied by the song \"Underdog\" by Kasabian. Froch, who entered to a medley of \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen and \"Shoot to Thrill\" by AC/DC, chose a more conventional walk through the stands. Unlike in their first fight, the crowd was overwhelmingly in support of Groves. In the early rounds of the fight itself, which was described as \"often cagey\" and one which \"burned slowly\", Groves started well by landing his jab consistently and catching Froch with a combination at the end of round two. Froch started to utilise his own jab in round three, as both boxers exchanged heavy shots. In the fourth, Groves returned to his jab, but Froch responded at the end of the round by catching Groves on the ropes with body punches.\n\nRound five was action-packed, as several exchanges of clean punches from both boxers elicited a standing ovation from the crowd. In the sixth, Froch pressed forward while landing more punches, but Groves responded with his own at the end of the round. He followed this up in round seven by landing a left hook that made Froch stumble, as well as a hurtful right hook soon afterwards. By this stage, Froch led by 67\u201366 on two of the judges' scorecards, with the third judge scoring it 68\u201365 for Groves. Froch began to rally back in the eighth by pursuing Groves against the ropes, which culminated in the finishing moment of the fight: a left hook from Froch, blocked by Groves' glove, was followed by a devastating right hook flush on the chin, sending Groves to the canvas in a crumpled heap. Without any controversy this time, referee Charlie Fitch immediately waved off the fight as a knockout at 2\u00a0minutes and 43\u00a0seconds, as Groves attempted to stand up on shaky legs.\n\nCompuBox statistics\nAccording to CompuBox, Froch threw 349 punches and landed 96 for an accuracy of 28%; Groves threw 314 punches and landed 126 for an accuracy of 40%. Groves had the edge in jabs, with 218 thrown and 83 landed (38% accuracy); Froch threw 212 and landed 40 (19% accuracy). Conversely, Froch threw 137 power punches and landed 56 (41% accuracy); Groves threw 96 and landed 43 (45% accuracy).\n\nAftermath\nImmediately after the fight, Froch said \"I am feeling unbelievably elated, this is the best moment in the history of my boxing career. ... I knew it was only going to take a couple of big right hands to the chin and I timed it perfectly.\" In the following days, he went on to express satisfaction in having soundly beaten his rival: \"I've had to endure some serious abuse, silly games and unnecessary antagonising. He's been antagonising me for so long. ... Some of the stuff his trainer was saying and Groves was saying, it was just horrible. ... He's now been sent back to the hole he crawled out of, as far as I'm concerned.\" \n\nGroves lamented that \"Carl should be gracious with his win. He certainly doesn't need to beat up on me some more. I totally dominated the first fight and I felt like I was in control of the second fight. ... It's just one of those punches. It's a shame it happened now\u2014I've spent my whole career where this could've happened and hasn't, and it's happened to me at the worst possible time. It certainly won't be the end of my career.\"\n\nOn 14 September, Groves returned to the ring and scored a unanimous decision against Christopher Rebrass\u00e9, winning the European and WBC Silver super-middleweight titles. In July 2015, more than a year afterwards and having not fought during that time, Froch retired from boxing. After announcing his retirement, he spoke more fondly of the event and rivalry with Groves: \"We all did ourselves proud and you couldn't have written the script for what happened. The script couldn't have been better. It's just amazing these things happen. ... To transcend the sport over to a whole new audience for me, on that platform and the way to finish it, in such a conclusive manner, was so satisfying. That is my defining moment.\"\n\nGroves also reflected on the rivalry that day: \"We don't need to be friends\u2014I've got friends. ... There's a rivalry when you're going to box and now that he's no longer a fighter that rivalry isn't there. ... He's a tough man to beat. Sometimes you think you've got him and a bit of controversy gets in the way and sometimes you're boxing really well, you're in full control, and then one punch and it can change a fight.\"\n\nThe attendance figure of 80,000 stood as a British post-War record until being surpassed by Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko in 2017, which drew 90,000. Notably, Joshua fought on the undercard of Froch\u2013Groves II and would go on to headline against Klitschko.\n\nUndercard\nJames DeGale defeated Brandon Gonz\u00e1les \u2013 \u00a04\nKevin Mitchell defeated Ghislain Maduma \u2013 TKO\u00a011\nJamie McDonnell defeated Tabtimdaeng Na Rachawat \u2013 TKO\u00a010\nAnthony Joshua defeated Matt Legg \u2013 \u00a01\nMartin Joseph Ward drew with Ian Bailey \u2013 \u00a01\nGamal Yafai defeated Jack Heath \u2013 TKO\u00a01\n\nBroadcasting\nThe fight was broadcast in 60 countries worldwide.

Like most European police special units, which were created in response to the tide of terrorism, this unit was formed from the above-average age of police officers, modernly equipped, and specially trained and to be ready to effectively act against terrorism.\n\nThe unit played a key role in the defense of Sarajevo during the siege. Some of the heaviest battles were fought by the unit, most battles ended in their favor which gained them enormous popularity. The members of the unit were informally called Viki\u0107evi, meaning \"the guys from commander Dragan Viki\u0107.\"\n\nThe unit was mostly under the direct command of the presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Official website\n\nBosnian War\nMilitary units and formations of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina", "machine_abstract": "The Special Police Squad (SPS) was formed in the spring of 1992 by Bosnian Serb forces to combat ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serbs during the Bosnian War, as well as other crimes committed on their behalf or at their instigation.\nIt is believed that SPS members were responsible for many atrocities including mass killings, rape, torture, abduction, forced displacement, looting, extortion, arson attacks, destruction of property, thefts from civilians' homes, kidnappings, executions without trial, enforced disappearances, sexual slavery, and trafficking women into prostitution.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Special Police Squad \"Bosna\"\".

{"id": "Epiphany (Chrisette Michele album)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany%20%28Chrisette%20Michele%20album%29", "title": "Epiphany (Chrisette Michele album)", "text": "Epiphany is the second studio album by American R&B and soul singer\u2013songwriter Chrisette Michele, released May 5, 2009 on Def Jam Recordings in the United States. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009. In January 2009, the title track \"Epiphany\" was released as its lead single.\n\nEpiphany debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, while selling 83,000 copies in its first week. Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 71/100 from Metacritic.\n\nBackground\n\nChrisette Michele told Billboards Mariel Concepcion that her new album would be \"more upbeat and youthful\". Production for the album was handled by Chuck Harmony, Claude Kelly, Bei Maejor, and Ne-Yo.\n\nMichele says one of her favorite tracks is the piano-based \"Blame It on Me\", in which she croons, \"Blame it on me/Say it's my fault/Say I left you out in the cold with a broken heart/I really don't care/I'm not crying no more/Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want/As long as it's over.\" \"On My Own\", Michele says, reminds her of her father. \"I'm very close to my dad, but recently I've learned how to handle situations on my own, without having him step in for me, and it took a lot of me to be able to do that\", she admits.\n\nCritical reception\nCritical response to the album was generally positive. AllMusic's Andy Kellman wrote that \"the material, while mostly well-crafted, runs together as a block of slow, serious songs broken up by only a couple brief upswings in energy\" and how \"Chrisette, naturally, sounds outstanding throughout, as a supernaturally talented vocalist whose songs are nonetheless easily relatable to anyone going through a breakup\u2014or, to a significantly lesser extent here, newfound love.\" He also felt that the album \"could have really used more rhythmic punch than a token throwback strutter.\" Maiya Norton of Vibe commented on how her album gained some edge, expressing some anger and heartbreak.\n\nDespite noting its production as a weakness, Miami Herald writer Adrian Ruhi gave the album 3 out of 4 stars and commended Michele for her vocals. In a positive review, The Koalition said that \"it would seem almost impossible for Chrisette Michele to avoid the \"sophomore slump\", but she finds a way by simply catering to an age old rule: just create great pieces of music.\" In some reviews her voice has been compared to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald. Giving the album four out of five stars, Timothy Michael Carson of About.com favored her unique, distinctive strong vocals, her cohesiveness, and the song \"Blame It on Me\", but was disappointed in the fact it had less of a jazz influence than her debut album I Am.\n\nCommercial performance\nEpiphany debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 83,000 units, giving Michele her first number 1 album on the chart.\n\nTrack listing\n \"Epiphany (I'm Leaving)\" (Shaffer Smith, Chuck Harmony) \u2013 3:28\n \"Notebook\" (Harmony, Claude Kelly) \u2013 3:46\n \"What You Do\" (feat.

{"id": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean%20Method%20of%20Memorization", "title": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization", "text": "Pythagorean Method of Memorization (PYMOM), also known as Triangular Movement Cycle (TMC), is a game-based, educational methodology or associative-learning technique that primarily uses corresponding information, such as terms and definitions on opposing sides, displayed on cue cards, to exploit psychological retention of information for academic study and language acquisition. PYMOM is named such because of the shape the cue-cards form during the progression of the game, a right-angled or Pythagorean triangle.\n\nIt is a theoretical educational method that is made up of several established and tested educational methods that have been in use for decades.\n\nMethodology\nPYMOM is a composite body of techniques that claims, in its digital form, to incorporate (to a greater or lesser degree): spaced repetition, non-failure redundant subroutine, chromatics, positive reinforcement, the Von Restorff effect, picture association, selective musical tonality, kinesthetics, the serial-position effect and meditation. There are two branches of this methodology:\nthe historical, physical incarnation, the Triangular Movement Cycle and\nthe digitized version, incorporating the significant addition of the aforementioned educational methods and theories, Pythagorean Method of Memorization.\n\nProcess & application\nAs with both branches, there is only one variable in the game or learning method: a correct or incorrect answer. The initial movement cycle also remains largely unchanged.\n\nThe movement cycle which is most crucial to the methodology and reinforces the spaced repetition, begins with either 3, 4 or 5 cards; 3 cards for a 6-card session, 4 cards for a 10-card session and 5 cards for the most advanced 15-card session. Because two-sided associative cue-cards are being used, all cards are presented with a congruent side up, either all \"terms\" or \"definitions,\" not mixed.\n\nOnce cards have been answered correctly, the predominant row has reached its maximum and a card must be graduated out of this row to continue the game. Thus the card to the far right comes into play.  Routines are repeated as each row reaches its maximum. A cue-card is finally eliminated from the game session by being answered correctly once more, after it has graduated to the top tier or row.\n\nTriangular Movement Cycle\n\nThe first manifestation, referred to as the \"Triangular Movement Cycle\" or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a manual movement cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student. This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers \u2014 and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort \u2014 and was very time consuming.\n\nThe term \"Pythagorean Method of Memorization\" was coined in 2013 and officially copyrighted in October 2014 by a Canadian company named You Learn Educational Solutions & Linguistics Inc. PYMOM takes the movement cycle from TMC and remedied the challenge of teaching the movement cycle itself to students by providing a software-based solution to handling cycles by means of sub-routines prompted by the user\u2019s input.\n\nPYMOM wove established educational theory into the fabric of TMC to create a viable educational platform for academic and linguistic study by several means. Because spaced repetition is intrinsically part of the movement-cycle subroutines, it adds to the content and surrounding experience making it into a platform. The developers of PYMOM describe it as an \u201corganic learning experience.\u201d The tenets that truly allow a learning system to be a PYMOM-based system are enumerated thusly: The Von Restorff effect: for example, where it features a language, this method is employed to further aid in memory retention of the highlighted word in the phrase.\n\nChromatics: there are no white backgrounds where learning takes place.\nPositive Reinforcement: There are no truly \"wrong\" responses, only mistakes. These mistakes are greeted by neutral reinforcement and \"correct\" responses are rewarded with positive reinforcement.\nPicture Association: Visual aids should accompany concept-based material.\nSelective Musical Tonality: the learning experience should always incorporate music; generally instrumental, that aids learning by increasing focus and reducing stress (which inhibits learning).\nKinesthetics: whether by utilizing a touch-screen, key board or mouse, a level of physical movement should always be present while learning to further increase retention.\nThe Serial Position Effect: taking breaks at specific, regular intervals to aid in learning and reduce stress levels.\nMeditation: a session of meditation should be incorporated into every learning session to allow for further retention of the information.\n\nReferences\n\nLearning methods\nCognitive training", "machine_abstract": "The Pythagoras method is one way to memorize the multiplication table, and it can be used in other ways as well.\nIt consists of:  The first step is to write down all numbers from 1 up to 12 on separate pieces of paper (or cards).

Surp Hakop Church is the oldest surviving church of New Julfa. It was built strictly for the religious needs of the people and did not have any kind of decorations. However, as the Armenian population in New Julfa increased, the church became insubstantial. Hence, Khoja Avedik, a wealthy silk merchant, went to the church and decided to expand the church when he could not attend a religious ceremony because the church was full. He decorated the church with lights, silver and gold chandeliers, and valuable canvases and paintings. He rebuilt the entire church using his own personal funds and named it St. Mary church. Khoja Avedik was then buried in the church after his death. Two large paintings painted by European artists have been bought by an Armenian businessman and have been donated to the church.\n\nArchitecture \nThe plan of the east-west rectangular church is of the type of domed halls in Armenian architecture. The building has several small arched domes, but its main dome, which has four skylights; is located in the middle of the building and is fixed on arches that rest on wide columns attached to the north and south walls. \n\nThese columns divide the interior of the church into three interconnected sections. In the eastern part of the building is the altar of the church and on both sides there are two rectangular chambers.\n\nThe materials used in the building are clay and brick. The interior walls of the building are covered with plaster, and on them are paintings with themes from the Bible. The area around the church, except for its eastern side, has a portico with twenty stone-carved columns. Arches connect all these columns. \n\nThe outer surface of the arches is decorated with glazed tiles in different colors, which adds to the beauty of the exterior of the church. There are various buildings in the churchyard. In 1848, the bell tower was built in the western part of the church and above its entrance.. Adjacent to the south side of the building is a small chapel called Stepanos. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher is located near and inside the courtyard of this church.\n\nGallery\n\nSee Also \nArmenian Apostolic Diocese of Isfahan and Southern Iran\n\nList of Armenian churches in Iran\n\nIran National Heritage List\n\nMinistry of Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nInterior photo\nExterior photo\n\nChurches in Isfahan\nArmenian Apostolic churches in Iran\nArchitecture of Iran\n1610s establishments in Iran\nOriental Orthodox congregations established in the 17th century\n17th-century churches in Iran", "machine_abstract": "St Mary's Church (Persian: \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u064a\u200e) is the cathedral church of the Diocese of Isfahan in Iran and was built between 1625\u20131629 by order of Shah Abbas I as his mausoleum after he died at Shiraz on March 24, 1628.\nThe building has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"St. Mary Church, Isfahan\".

He served as the second Roman Catholic Bishop of Portsmouth from 1900 to 1910.\n\nLife\nBorn in London on 2 September 1841, he was a student at St. Edmund's College, Ware between 1855 and 1863. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Southwark on 4 October 1864. Cahill had been Rector of Ryde since 1868, and vicar-general of the diocese since its foundation.\n\nHe was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Portsmouth and Titular Bishop of Thagora on 21 March 1900. His consecration to the Episcopate took place on 1 May 1900, the principal consecrator was Francis Bourne, Bishop of Southwark (later Archbishop of Westminster), and the principal co-consecrators were John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport and Menevia and Charles Maurice Graham, Coadjutor Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions. It was thus that the diocese was enriched by the presence of such congregations as the Benedictines of Solesmes, both monks and nuns. Five Abbeys (Douai, Quarr, Farnborough, Ryde, and East Cowes) were founded in the diocese.\n\nBishop Cahill died at Portsmouth on 2 August 1910, aged 68.\n\nReferences \n\n1841 births\n1910 deaths\nRoman Catholic clergy from London\nRoman Catholic bishops of Portsmouth\n20th-century Roman Catholic bishops in England", "machine_abstract": "Bishop John Cahill, CSC is the Bishop of Dromore in Northern Ireland and Archdiocese of Armagh & Emly.\nHe was born on 16 May 1957 at Lisburn Cathedral to parents Michael and Margaret Cahill who were married there as well.

The manuscript has survived in complete condition. It has marginalia, 12th century canon tables and illuminated headpieces, and five significant inserted 12th century miniatures.\n\nDescription \n\nThe codex contains the text of the four Gospels on 164 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, 29 lines per page. According to Hermann von Soden it is an ornamented manuscript.\n\nThe text is divided according to chapters (), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their titles () at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 234 Sections, the last in 19:9), without references to the Eusebian Canons.\n\nIt also contains Epistula ad Carpianum, Eusebian Canon tables, tables of the , lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use), subscriptions at the end of each of the Gospels, and pictures.\n\nText \nThe Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it to the textual family Kx. Kurt Aland placed it in Category V.\n\nAccording to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 20. No profile was made for Luke 10. It forms a textual cluster with codex 281.\n\nHistory \n\nC. R. Gregory dated the manuscript to the 12th century. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 12th century. Formerly it was held at the Athos monastery (St. Andrew E'). C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886.\n\nThe manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Gregory (906e). It was not on the Scrivener's list, but it was added to his list by Edward Miller in the 4th edition of A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament.\n\nThe manuscript was described by Kenneth W. Clark.\n\nCurrently it is housed in the Princeton University Library (Garrett 6), in the United States.\n\nSee also \n\n List of New Testament minuscules\n Minuscule 905\n Biblical manuscript\n Textual criticism\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n \n\nGreek New Testament minuscules\n12th-century biblical manuscripts\nGospel Books", "machine_abstract": "The Minuscule 906 is the name of two different manuscripts, both written in Latin and dated to the 9th century.\nMinuscule 906a (also known as Codex Vindabonae) was discovered by Johannes von Soden at Verona on September 16, 1753 during his travels through Italy.

Workman (1835\u20131906) was a pioneer agriculturist in Los Angeles, California, and co-owner of a saddlery there. He also served on the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of city government in that era.\n\nPersonal\n\nFamily\n\nWorkman was born October 20, 1835, in Missouri, the son of David Workman of Clifton-Penrith, England, and Nancy Hook of Virginia. He had a brother, William H. Workman. Around 1854 the family crossed the Great Plains to settle in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was married three times\u2014first, in Booneville, Missouri, shortly after the Civil War, to Julia C. Benedict (his childhood sweetheart), who died in 1876; then to Gilla Maria Corum of Boonville, in 1878 in Los Angeles; and finally, in 1884, to Anna K. Webb of Los Angeles; she died in 1900. He had two daughters, Gilleta M., and Laura (Mrs. Conrad Krebs).\n\nPersonality\n\nHis biography in the Los Angeles Public Library states that:\n\nElijah H. Workman was of the pioneer type of public figure: he wore boots to his dying day and lacked the more formal education of our times. With the conscientious fulfillment of his public duties[,] he combined the pioneer spirit of enterprise and development.\n\nIn politics he was a Democrat, and in religion a Protestant.\n\nDeath\n\nWorkman died July 17, 1906, at the age of 71 in his home at 1815 East Second Street, Boyle Heights.\n\nVocation\n\nWorkman was in the harness and saddlery business with his brother, William H. Workman, at 76 Main Street. They also dealt in hides, which were recognized as a medium of exchange throughout the Southwest.\n\nReturning from his trip to Missouri, Workman brought back seeds for trees and plants that he propagated in his own yard, getting the reputation of a \"pioneer agriculturalist.\" His property, surrounded by 10th and 11th streets, Hill and Main streets, was planted with orange trees and flowers. He sold that land and moved to Boyle Heights after the death of his third wife.\n\nPublic service\n\nWorkman was a member of the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of city government, in 1866\u201367, 1869\u201370, 1871\u201372 and 1874\u201375. He was on the city Board of Education in 1879\u201380 and on the Board of Equalization in 1869\u201370.\n\nIn 1870 Workman was a member of a committee to establish a public park, which was accomplished between Fifth and Sixth streets, and Workman planted seedlings from his own garden and nursed them from water hauled in barrels from his property a few blocks away. He planted elms, maples and rubber trees on the park site, first known as Central Park and then as Pershing Square.\n\nSee also\nBoyle-Workman family\nWorkman-Temple family\nWorkman and Temple Family Homestead Museum\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican agriculturalists\nBusinesspeople from Los Angeles\nLos Angeles Common Council (1850\u20131889) members\n1906 deaths\n1835 births\nPoliticians from Los Angeles\n19th-century American politicians\n19th century in Los Angeles\n19th-century American businesspeople", "machine_abstract": "Elijah Henry Workman (December 31, 1784 \u2013 September 16, 1868) was the first mayor of Boston and served from 1852 to 1854.

{"id": "Gangsta rap", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta%20rap", "title": "Gangsta rap", "text": "Gangsta rap or gangster rap, initially called reality rap, emerged in the mid- to late 1980s as a controversial hip hop subgenre whose lyrics assert the culture and values typical of American street gangs and street hustlers. Many gangsta rappers flaunt associations with real street gangs, like the Crips and the Bloods. Gangsta rap's pioneers were Schoolly D of Philadelphia in 1985, Ice-T of Los Angeles in 1986, and especially N.W.A in 1988. In 1993, via record producer Dr. Dre, rapper Snoop Dogg, and their G-funk sound, gangsta rap took the rap genre's lead and became mainstream, popular music.\n\nGangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and drug dealing, as well as misogyny, promiscuity, and materialism. Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or police brutality, and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including Spike Lee, but first by pastor Calvin Butts and especially by activist C. Delores Tucker.\n\n1985\u20131988: Origins and early years\n\nSchoolly D and Ice-T\nPhiladelphia rapper Schoolly D is generally considered the first \u201cgangsta rapper\u201d or one of the first \u201cgangsta rappers\u201d, significantly influencing the more popular early gangsta rap originator, Ice-T. Ice-T was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1958. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles where he rose to prominence in the West Coast hip hop scene. In 1986, Ice-T released \"6 in the Mornin'\", which is regarded as one of the first gangsta rap songs. Ice-T had been MCing since the early '80s, but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D and his 1985 album Schoolly D. In an interview with PROPS magazine, Ice-T said:\n\nHere's the exact chronological order of what really went down: The first record that came out along those lines was Schoolly D's \"P.S.K.\" Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made \"6 in the Mornin'\". The vocal delivery was the same: ' ... P.S.K. is makin' that green', ' ... six in the morning, police at my door'. When I heard that record I was like \"Oh shit!\" and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn't sound like P.S.K., but I liked the way he was flowing with it. P.S.K. was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was \"... one by one, I'm knockin' em out.\" All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down and all that with \"6 in the Mornin'\". At the same time my single came out, Boogie Down Productions hit with Criminal Minded, which was a gangster-based album. It wasn't about messages or \"You Must Learn\", it was about gangsterism.\n\nIn 2011, Ice-T repeated in his autobiography that Schoolly D was his inspiration for gangsta rap. Ice-T continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s: Rhyme Pays in 1987, Power in 1988 and The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say in 1989. Ice-T's lyrics also contained strong political commentary, and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a no-win situation.\n\nSchoolly D's debut album, Schoolly D, and especially the song \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\", would heavily influence not only Ice-T, but also Eazy-E and N.W.A (most notably in the song \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\") as well as the Beastie Boys on their seminal hardcore hip hop inspired album Licensed to Ill (1986).\n\nBoogie Down Productions\nBoogie Down Productions released their first single, \"Say No Brother (Crack Attack Don't Do It)\", in 1986. It was followed by \"South-Bronx/P is Free\" and \"9mm Goes Bang\" in the same year. The latter is the most gangsta-themed song of the three; in it, KRS-One boasts about shooting a crack dealer and his posse to death (in self-defense). The album Criminal Minded followed in 1987, and was the first rap album to have firearms on its cover. Shortly after the release of this album, BDP's DJ, Scott LaRock was shot and killed. After this, BDP's subsequent records were more focused with the inadequate rationale removed.\n\nOther early influences\nThe New York-based Run-DMC and LL Cool J, though originating prior to the establishment of \u201cgangsta rap\u201d as a cohesive genre, were influential in the formation of gangsta rap, often producing early aggressive hardcore hip hop songs and being among the first rappers to dress in gang-like street clothing. The seminal Long Island-based group Public Enemy featured aggressive, politically charged lyrics, which had an especially strong influence on gangsta rappers such as Ice Cube. Rakim and Eric B & Rakim would further influence gangsta rap with aggressive, street-oriented raps, especially on the 1987 album Paid In Full .\n\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles-based group C.I.A. (consisting of Ice Cube, K-Dee, Sir Jinks) rapped over the rap group Beastie Boys\u2019 tracks for songs such as \"My Posse\" and \"Ill-Legal\", and the Beastie Boys' influence can be seen significantly in N.W.A's early albums.  The Beastie Boys had started out as a hardcore punk band, but after introduction to producer Rick Rubin and the exit of Kate Schellenbach they became a rap group. According to Rolling Stone Magazine, their 1986 album Licensed to Ill is \"filled with enough references to guns, drugs and empty sex (including the pornographic deployment of a Wiffleball bat in \"Paul Revere\") to qualify as a gangsta-rap cornerstone.\"\n\n1988\u20131997: Golden age\n\nN.W.A.\nThe first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton, released in 1988. Straight Outta Compton would establish West Coast hip hop as a vital genre, and establish Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. Straight Outta Compton sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song \"Fuck tha Police\" earned a letter from FBI Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing law enforcement's resentment of the song. Due to the influence of Ice-T, N.W.A, and Ice Cube's early solo career, gangsta rap is often somewhat erroneously credited as being a mostly West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Boogie Down Productions in shaping the genre and despite Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D being generally regarded as the first gangsta rapper.\n\nIn the early 1990s, former N.W.A member Ice Cube would further influence gangsta rap with his hardcore, socio-political solo albums, which suggested the potential of gangsta rap as a political medium to give voice to inner-city youth. N.W.A's second album, Efil4zaggin (1991) (released after Ice Cube's departure from the group), broke ground as the first gangsta rap album to reach #1 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\nWest, East and South\nAside from N.W.A and Ice T, Too Short (from Oakland, California), Kid Frost and the South Gate-based Latino group Cypress Hill were pioneering West Coast rappers with gangsta rap songs and themes. Above the Law also played an important role in the gangsta rap movement, as their 1990 debut album Livin' Like Hustlers, as well as their guest appearance on N.W.A's 1991 Efil4zaggin, foreshadowed the dominance of the genre in 1990s starting with Dr. Dre's The Chronic.\n\nEast Coast hardcore rappers like Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, and EPMD also reflected the trend in hip-hop music in the late 1980s towards hard-hitting, angry, aggressive, and politically conscious lyrics, revolving around crime, violence, poverty, war and gunplay.\n\nThe Houston-based group known as the Geto Boys came out around the late 1980s and made songs containing both gangsta themes of crime and violence. Early 90s, the Geto Boys gained Top 40 hit \"Mind Playing Tricks On Me\". The group notably released gangsta song \"Scarface\", a track centered on selling cocaine and killing rival gang members. The Geto Boys are also known for being the first rap group to sample from the movie Scarface, a film which became the basis for various mafioso rap samples in the 1990s. Furthermore, the Geto Boys, along with Jam Master J's and Erick Sermon's group Flatlinerz and Prince Paul's and RZA's group Gravediggaz, are often cited as pioneers of \"horrorcore\" rap, a transgressive and abrasive subgenre of hardcore rap or gangsta rap which focuses on common horror themes, such as the supernatural and the occult, often with gothic or macabre lyrics, satanic imagery and slasher film or splatter film-like violence.\n\nIce-T's solo career\nIce-T released one of the seminal albums of the genre, OG: Original Gangster in 1991. It also contained a song by his new thrash metal group Body Count, who released a self titled album in 1992. Particular controversy surrounded one of its songs \"Cop Killer\". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a police target seeking revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the National Rifle Association and various police advocacy groups. Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T's upcoming album Home Invasion and dropped Ice-T from the label. Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips \"... they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that.\" In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of Cop Killer, the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.\"\n\nIce-T's next album, Home Invasion was postponed as a result of the controversy, and was finally released in 1993. While it contained gangsta elements, it was his most political album to date. After a proposed censoring of the Home Invasion album cover art, he left Warner Bros. Records. Ice-T's subsequent releases went back to straight gangsta-ism, but were never as popular as his earlier releases. He had alienated his core audience with his involvement in metal, his emphasis on politics and with his uptempo Bomb-Squad style beats during a time when G-funk was popular. He published a book \"The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a @#!*% ?\" in 1994.\n\nG-funk and Death Row Records\n\nIn 1992, former N.W.A member Dr. Dre released The Chronic, a massive seller (eventually going triple platinum) which showed that explicit gangsta rap could hold mass commercial appeal just like more pop-oriented rappers such as MC Hammer, The Fresh Prince and Tone L\u014dc. The album established the dominance of West Coast gangsta rap and Dre's new post-N.W.A label, Death Row Records (owned by Dr. Dre along with Marion \"Suge\" Knight), as Dre's album showcased a stable of promising new Death Row rappers. The album also began the subgenre of G-funk, a slow, drawled form of hip hop that dominated the rap charts for some time.\n\nExtensively sampling P-Funk bands, especially Parliament and Funkadelic, G-funk was multi-layered, yet simple and easy to dance to. The simple message of its lyrics, that life's problems could be overcome by guns, alcohol, and marijuana, endeared it to a teenage audience. The single \"Nuthin' but a \"G\" Thang\" became a crossover hit, with its humorous, House Party-influenced video becoming an MTV staple despite that network's historic orientation towards rock music.\n\nAnother success was Ice Cube's Predator album, released at about the same time as The Chronic in 1992. It sold over 5 million copies and was #1 in the charts, propelled by the hit single \"It Was a Good Day\", despite the fact that Ice Cube was not a Death Row artist. One of the genre's biggest crossover stars was Dre's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Snoop Doggy Dogg (Doggystyle), whose exuberant, party-oriented themes made songs such as \"Gin and Juice\" club anthems and top hits nationwide. In 1996, 2Pac signed with Death Row and released the multi-platinum double album All Eyez on Me. Not long afterward, his shocking murder brought gangsta rap into the national headlines and propelled his posthumous The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory album (released under the alias \"Makaveli\") (which eerily featured an image of 2Pac being crucified on the front cover) to the top of the charts. Warren G was another G-funk musician along with the now deceased Nate Dogg. Other successful G-funk influenced artists included Spice 1, MC Eiht and MC Ren, all of them reaching decent positions on the Billboard 100, in spite of not being associated with Death Row.\n\nMafioso rap\nMafioso rap is a hardcore hip hop subgenre founded by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s. East coast mafioso rap was partially the counterpart of West Coast G-funk rap. Mafioso rap is characterized by references to famous mobsters and mafiosi, racketeering and organized crime in general (but especially the Sicilian Mafia, the Italian-American Mafia, African-American organized crime and Latin American organized crime or drug cartels). Though a significant amount of mafioso rap was more gritty and street-oriented, focusing on street-level organized crime, other mafioso rap artists frequently focused on lavish, self-indulgent, materialistic and luxurious subject matter associated with crime bosses and high-level mobsters, such as expensive drugs, cars and expensive champagne. Though the genre died down for several years, it re-emerged in 1995 when Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically acclaimed solo album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... It. 1995 also saw the release of Doe or Die by Nas' prot\u00e9g\u00e9 AZ and the release of the album 4,5,6 by subgenre originator Kool G Rap. This album featured other mafioso rap artists MF Grimm, Nas and B-1. These three albums brought the genre to mainstream recognition, and inspired other East Coast artists, such as Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G. and Nas, to adopt the same themes as well with their albums Reasonable Doubt, Life After Death and It Was Written (respectively).\n\nEast coast gangsta rap was popular by the late 1990s, and there were more modern mafioso rap albums such as Ghostface Killah's Fishscale, Jay-Z's American Gangster and Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II.  Many rappers, such as Conejo, Mr Criminal, T.I., Rick Ross, Fabolous, Jadakiss, Jim Jones and Cassidy have maintained popularity with lyrics about self-centered urban criminal lifestyles or \"hustling\". Lil' Kim's mafioso album La Bella Mafia, released in 2003, was a commercial success, receiving platinum certification. In 2020, Belgian rapper CHG Unfadable released the mafioso rap album Lifestyle featuring Kool G Rap, AZ and the first Italian-American mob rapper The Shark. After a long slump in the popularity of Mafioso rap, music collective Griselda re-popularised nostalgic Mafioso rap and boom-bap rap style of the 90s and 80s with artists such as Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Benny the Butcher, and Daringer.\n\nEast Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast\u2013West Coast feud\nMeanwhile, rappers from New York City, such as Wu-Tang Clan, Black Moon (group) and Boot Camp Clik, Onyx, Big L, Mobb Deep, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., DMX, and The LOX, among others, pioneered a grittier sound known as hardcore hip hop. In 1994, both Nas and The Notorious B.I.G. released their debut albums Illmatic (April 19) and Ready to Die (September 13) respectively, which paved the way for New York City to take back dominance from the West Coast. In an interview for The Independent in 1994, the Wu-Tang Clan's GZA commented on the term \"gangsta rap\" and its association with his group's music and hip hop at the time:\n\nIt is widely speculated that the ensuing \"East/West\" battle between Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records resulted in the deaths of Death Row Records' 2Pac (who was 25 years old) and Bad Boy Records' The Notorious B.I.G. (who was 24 years old). Even before the murders, Death Row had begun to unravel, as co-founder Dr. Dre had left earlier in 1996; in the aftermath of 2Pac's death, label owner Suge Knight was sentenced to prison for a parole violation, and Death Row proceeded to sink quickly as most of its remaining artists, including Snoop Dogg, left. Dr. Dre, at the MTV Video Music Awards, claimed that \"gangsta rap was dead\". While Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Entertainment fared better than its West Coast rival, it eventually began to lose popularity and support by the end of the decade, due to its pursuit of a more mainstream sound, as well as challenges from Atlanta and New Orleans-based labels, especially, Master P's No Limit stable of popular rappers.\n\nSouthern and Midwest gangsta rap\nHouston first came on to the national scene in the late 1980s with the violent and disturbing stories told by the Geto Boys, with member Scarface achieving major solo success in the mid-1990s. Willie D recorded G rap album also.\nAfter the deaths of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls and the media attention the murders generated, gangsta rap became an even greater commercial force. However, most of the industry's major labels were in turmoil, bankrupt, or creatively stagnant, and new labels representing the rap scenes in new locations sprang up.\n\nMaster P's No Limit Records label, based out of New Orleans, became quite popular in the late 1990s, though critical success was very scarce, with the exceptions of some later additions like Mystikal (Ghetto Fabulous, 1998). No Limit had begun its rise to national popularity with Master P's The Ghetto Is Trying to Kill Me! (1994), and had major hits with Silkk the Shocker (Charge It 2 Da Game, 1998) and C-Murder (Life or Death, 1998). Cash Money Records, also based out of New Orleans, had enormous commercial success beginning in the late 1990s with a similar musical style but utilized a quality-over-quantity business approach unlike No Limit.\n\nMemphis collective Hypnotize Minds, led by Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat, have taken gangsta rap to some of its darker extremes. Led by in-house producers DJ Paul and Juicy J, the label became known for its pulsating, menacing beats and uncompromisingly thuggish lyrics. However, in the mid-2000s, the group began attaining more mainstream popularity, eventually culminating in the Three 6 Mafia winning an Academy Award for the song \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" from Hustle & Flow.\n\nMidwest gangsta rap originated in the mid-1990s and rose to major prominence in the 2000s. Midwest hip hop was originally distinctive for its faster-paced flow. This is evident in the styles of the earliest Midwestern rappers to release albums, Chicago's Twista and Cleveland's Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Bone Thugs, known for their fast, harmonizing vocals coupled with an ultra-quick rap delivery, would achieve major success with their critically acclaimed 1995 album E. 1999 Eternal, which featured a major hit in the Grammy-winning \"Tha Crossroads\".\n\nThe Chopped and Screwed genre was developed in Houston, Texas which remains the location most associated with the style. The late DJ Screw, a South Houston DJ, is credited with the creation of and early experimentation with the genre. DJ Screw began making mixtapes of the slowed-down music in the early 1990s and began the Screwed Up Click. This provided a significant outlet for MCs in the South-Houston area, and helped local rappers such as Big Moe, Lil' Flip, E.S.G., UGK, Lil' Keke, South Park Mexican, Spice 1 and Z-Ro gain regional and sometimes national prominence.\n\nNarco-rap\nNarco-rap is a music scene, similar to the early underground gangsta rap scene, that emerged in north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas. Its lyrical content, popular among Latino youth, is violent and focuses on the power of drug cartels and the gruesomeness of the Mexican drug war. Narco-rap emerged in the urban areas of Tamaulipas, a Mexican state currently subject to a turf war between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Narco-rappers sing about the life of mobsters and the reality of the cities under the cartel's rule. Some of the key players of the genre are Cano y Blunt, DemenT and Big Los.\n\n1997\u20132007: Bling era\nBefore the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not \"selling out\" to the pop charts. However, the rise of Bad Boy Records, propelled by the massive crossover success of Bad Boy head Sean \"Puffy\" Combs's 1997 ensemble album, No Way Out, on the heels of the media attention generated by the murders of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G., signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (or as it is referred to on the East Coast, hardcore rap), as it morphed into a new subgenre of hip hop which would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted.\n\nThe earlier, somewhat controversial crossover success enjoyed by popular gangsta rap songs like \"Gin and Juice\" gave way to gangsta rap's becoming a widely accepted staple on the pop charts in the late 1990s. For example, between the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album Ready to Die in 1994 and his follow-up, the posthumous Life After Death in 1997, his sound changed from a darker, tense production, with lyrics projecting desperation and paranoia, to a cleaner, more laid-back sound, fashioned for popular consumption (though the references to guns, drug dealing and life as a thug on the street remained).\n\nR&B-styled hooks and instantly recognizable samples of well-known soul and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased primarily in Sean \"Puffy\" Combs's latter-day production work for The Notorious B.I.G. (\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\"), Mase (\"Feels So Good\") and non-Bad Boy artists such as Jay-Z (\"Can I Get A...\") and Nas (\"Street Dreams\"). Also achieving similar levels of success with a similar sound at the same time as Bad Boy was Master P and his No Limit label in New Orleans, as well as the New Orleans upstart Cash Money label.\n\nMany of the artists who achieved such mainstream success in the 2000s, such as Jay-Z, DMX, then 50 Cent and G-Unit, originated from the gritty 1990s East Coast rap scene and were influenced by hardcore artists such as The Notorious B.I.G., Wu-Tang Clan and Nas. Mase and Cam'ron were typical of a more relaxed, casual flow that became the pop-gangsta norm. By contrast, other rappers like Eminem and DMX enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s by rapping about ever-more macabre tales of death and violence, maintaining commercial relevance by attempting to be controversial and subversive, growing on the Horrorcore rap style born in the late 1980s.\n\n2007\u2013present: Mainstream decline, rise of drill and trap\n\nBy the late 2000s, alternative hip hop had secured its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap. Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West's Graduation and 50 Cent's Curtis as a turning point for hip hop. Kanye West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so. Although he designed it as a melancholic pop album rather than a rap album, Kanye's following 808s & Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album was predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music. During the release of The Blueprint 3, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, \"... it's not gonna be a #1 album. That's where I'm at right now. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made.\" Jay-Z elaborated that like Kanye, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear, and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip-hop.\n\nIn the 2010s, a new form of gangsta rap known as drill emerged from the Midwest, gaining popularity via rappers such as Lil Durk, Chief Keef, Lil Reese, King Von, and Lil Herb. West Coast rapper Vince Staples is part of the new generation of rappers that is influenced by G-funk. Being from the same area as Snoop himself, Staples has a sound that is lyrically in comparison to gangsta rap, though also containing elements of conscious rap. His 2015 album Summertime '06 reflects the \"challenges of racism, injustice, and violent fallouts in his childhood neighborhood.\" Other gangsta rappers who have maintained success in recent times include Rick Ross, Jeezy, Nipsey Hussle, Gucci Mane, Freddie Gibbs, Meek Mill, Ace Hood, Pusha T, YG, A$AP Ferg, Bobby Shmurda, A$AP Rocky, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, 21 Savage, Kodak Black, Dave East, Tay-K, Uncle Murda, Casanova, Blueface, NLE Choppa, Lil Loaded, Pop Smoke, 22Gz, 42 Dugg, Lil Baby, and DaBaby.\n\nGangsta rap's pioneers have met success in other forms of pop culture as well. In 2016, N.W.A. was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were followed up by the late Tupac Shakur in 2017 who was inducted as the first solo hip hop act, under his first year of eligibility as a nominee. Other Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Hip-Hop Acts include the 2007 induction of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, who are considered pioneers of expanding the sound of Hip-Hop from disco inspired partying, to street reality that inspired social change. The 2009 induction of Run-D.M.C to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened the door for more Hip-Hop inductions, as they were followed up by the 2012 induction of Beastie Boys, and the 2013 induction of Public Enemy.\n\nCriticism and debate\nThe explicit nature of gangsta rap's lyrics has made it heavily controversial. There is also debate about the causation between gangsta rap and violent behavior. A study by the Prevention Research Center of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Berkeley, Calif., finds young people who listen to rap and hip-hop are more likely to abuse alcohol and commit violent acts.\n\nCritics of gangsta rap hold that it glorifies and encourages criminal behavior, and may be at least partially to blame for the problem of street gangs. Although this view is often stereotyped as that of white conservatives, it has been shared by members of the black community, most notably Bill Cosby.\n\nThose who are supportive or at least less critical of gangsta rap hold that crime on the street level is for the most part a reaction to poverty and that gangsta rap reflects the reality of lower class life. Many believe that the blaming of crime on gangsta rap is a form of unwarranted moral panic; The World Development Report 2011, for instance, confirmed that most street gang members maintain that poverty and unemployment is what drove them to crime; none made reference to music. Ice Cube famously satirized the blame placed on gangsta rap for social ills in his song \"Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It\". Many gangsta rappers maintain they are playing a \"role\" in their music like an actor in a play or film, and do not encourage the behavior in their music.\n\nMoreover, English scholar Ronald A.T. Judy has argued that gangsta rap reflects the experience of blackness at the end of political economy, when capital is no longer wholly produced by human labor but in a globalized system of commodities. In this economy, gangsta rap traffics blackness as a commodifiable effect of \"being a nigga\". In other words, gangsta rap defines the experience of blackness, in which he locates in gangsta rap's deployment of the word \"nigga\", in this new global economic system as \"adaptation to the force of commodification\". For Judy, nigga (and gangsta rap) becomes an epistemologically authentic category for describing the condition of being black in the modern \"realm of things\".\n\nDespite this, many who hold that gangsta rap is not responsible for social ills are critical of the way many gangsta rappers intentionally exaggerate their criminal pasts for the sake of street credibility. Rick Ross and Slim Jesus among others have been heavily criticized for this.\n\n2Pacalypse Now controversy\nIn 1992, then-U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle blasted the recording industry for producing rap music he believed led to violence. Quayle called on Time Warner Inc. subsidiary, Interscope Records, to withdraw Tupac Shakur's 1991 debut album 2Pacalypse Now from stores. Quayle stated, \"There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published\u2014It has no place in our society.\" Quayle's motivation came in light of the murder of a Texas state trooper Bill Davidson, who had been shot by Ronald Ray Howard after he had been pulled over. Howard was driving a stolen vehicle while songs from 2Pacalypse Now were playing on the tape deck when he was stopped by the officer. The family of Davidson filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope Records, claiming the record's violent lyrics incite \"imminent lawless action\". District Judge John D. Rainey held that Shakur and the record companies did not have the duty to prevent distributing his music when they could not reasonably foresee violence arising from the distribution, nor was there any intent for the usage of the music as a \"product for purposes of recovery under a products liability theory.\" Judge Rainey concluded the suit by ruling the Davidsons' argument that the music was unprotected speech under the First Amendment was irrelevant.\n\nC. Delores Tucker\nPoliticians such as C. Delores Tucker have cited concerns with sexually explicit and misogynistic lyrics featured in hip-hop tracks. Tucker claimed the explicit lyrics used in hip-hop songs were threatening to the African-American community. Tucker, who once was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Pennsylvania state government, focused on rap music in 1993, labeling it as \"pornographic filth\" and claiming it was offensive and demeaning to black women. Tucker stated, \"You can't listen to all that language and filth without it affecting you.\" Tucker also handed out leaflets containing lyrics from rap music and urged people to read them aloud. She picketed stores that sold the music and handed out petitions. She then proceeded to buy stock in Time Warner, Sony and other companies for the sole purpose to protest rap music at shareholders meetings. In 1994, Tucker protested when the NAACP nominated rapper Tupac Shakur for one of its image awards as Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture from his role in Poetic Justice.\n\nSome rappers labeled her \"narrow-minded\", and some ridiculed her in their lyrics, notably Shakur, who mentions her multiple times in his diamond certified 1996 album All Eyez On Me. Shakur mentions Tucker in the tracks \"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\" and \"How Do U Want It\", where Shakur sings \"Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker/Instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother.\" Tucker filed a $10 million lawsuit against Shakur's estate for the comments made in both songs. In her lawsuit, she claimed that the comments were slanderous, caused her emotional distress and invaded her personal privacy. The case was eventually dismissed. Shakur was not the only rap artist to mention her in his songs, as Jay-Z, Eminem, Lil' Kim, The Game and Lil Wayne have all previously criticized Tucker for her opposition of the genre.\n\nFirst Amendment rights\nGangsta rap has also raised questions of whether it is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, since lyrics may express violence and may be considered true threats. The Supreme Court ruled in Elonis v. United States (2015) that mens rea, the intent to commit a crime, is necessary to convict someone of a crime for using threatening words in a rap song.\n\nIn a notable case, rapper Jamal Knox, performing as \"Mayhem Mal\", wrote a gangsta rap song named \"F*** the Police\" shortly after he was arrested for gun and drug charges in Pittsburgh. The song's lyrics specifically named the two arresting officers, and included explicit violent threats including \"Let's kill these cops cuz they don't do us no good\". One of the officers, believing to be threatened, subsequently left the force.\n\nKnox was convicted of making terroristic threats and of witness intimidation in a bench trial, and the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held that the song's lyrics amounted to a true threat. Knox petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case, and academics joined rappers Killer Mike, Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, Yo Gotti, Fat Joe and 21 Savage in an amicus curiae brief arguing that Knox's song should be seen as a political statement and thus is protected speech. The Supreme Court declined review in April 2019.\n\nInternational influence\n\nGerman gangsta-rap \n\nThe gangsta-rap movement in Germany derived its roots from the '90s and since 2003\u20132004 has become a successful subgenre of German hip hop. Contextually and musically, it borrows its influences from the French and US-based gangsta rap and battle rap. Although there is a certain correlation between street-rap and gangsta-rap, gangsta-rap is not considered as a derivative genre since it is only partially related to street-rap and has contextually little to do with the other subgenre.\n\nHistory\nPioneers of the subgenre gangsta-rap, who have since the 1990s still been active, are Kool Savas and Azad. Within the genre, they implemented an incredibly explicit, broken and aggressive text, that originally still had much influence from English text elements. This style of rap, after the turn of the century, was implemented by the majority of gangsta-rappers in Germany and is, therefore, a very well respected form on the approach of German gangsta-rap. On the other hand, Savas distanced himself from these vulgar and explicit texts. One of the founding fathers of German gangsta-rap, Charnell, the little-known rapper and martial-arts artist, thematized growing up in the midst of a social renaissance. Gangsta-rap in other countries, that resembled the music of the R\u00f6delheim Hartreim Projekt in Germany, was commercially successful in the 2000s. Germany at the time, however, had few rappers active in this subgenre; allowing certain artists in the Berlin underground-hip-hop scene an opportunity to establish themselves with their lyrics representing a certain hardship acquired through the criminal lifestyle which had previously been popularized. Recognizable names from the underground scene are Bass Sultan Hengzt, Fler, MC Bogy or MOK. Another notable rapper and pioneer of gangsta-rap in Germany is Azad. Although he came from the rural Frankfurt am Main, he was a big reason this subgenre became popular in Germany. In his lyrical text, he thematized the rigid and rough lifestyle of living in the northwest district of Frankfurt.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2003 the process of commercialization of this subgenre began. Contrary to popular belief, a variable of the German gangsta-rap became popular before the actual subgenre itself did. When Sido, a notoriously known rapper from Berlin, released his album Maske which thematized gangs, drugs and violence, this album became the first of its genre to sell 100,000 copies. Following that album Sido released another two named Ich and Ich und meine Maske which both had over 100,000 sold copies and emphasized the success of his first album.\n\nFollowing the success of Sido and his albums, Bushido became the next artist to emerge from the German gangsta-rap scene. He established himself a career and became the most important representative of German gangsta-rap of his time. Aggro Berlin, the label those two artists were both represented by, stated that this version of rap was the second, more aggressive evolution of German hip-hop. Bushido's albums Carlo Cokxxx Nutten with Fler and Bushido's debut album Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline had relatively little success although the prominent topics on his album reflected directly with the themes that made Sido popular.\n\nFollowing the continuous success of Sido and Bushido came a wave of rappers who were trying, with the help of major-labels, to establish themselves and be recognized by the populace. Eventually came Massiv, who was signed with Sony BMG, and was crowned by his label to be the German 50 Cent. This artist did not reach the success of 50 Cent. Further artists such as Baba Saad or Kollegah have since then established themselves as relatively successful in the German charts. As of recently, names such as Farid Bang, Nate57, Majoe & Jasko and Haftbefehl have appeared on the charts regularly.\n\nMusical style\nGangsta-rap in Germany originated from Queensbridge-rap in the 1990s as well as French gangsta-rap. Characteristically the necessary ambiance and melody for this type of hip-hop needs to be melancholic, dark and often threatening. Often, the songs incorporate piano, choir, synthesizers, but also samples from classical and neo-classical arrangements. All complexities such as minimalistic arrangements to vast orchestral symphonic arrangements are used and sampled in this subgenre.\n\nRoad rap \n\nRoad rap (also known as British gangsta rap or simply UK rap) is a genre of music pioneered in South London, primarily in Brixton and Peckham. The genre was pioneered by groups such as PDC, SMS, GAS, PYG, SN1, North Star, MashTown, U.S.G. and artists such as Giggs, K Koke, Sneakbo and Nines. The genre came to the fore as a backlash against the perceived commercialisation of grime in the mid-late 2000s in London. The genre came to prominence around 2007 with the rise of Giggs. Road rap retained the explicit depictions of violence and British gang culture found in some early grime music and combines it with a musical style more similar to American gangsta rap than the sound system influenced music of grime, dubstep, UK garage, jungle, reggae and dub.\n\nGangs played a large part in the genre, with gangs such as Star Gang (formed by former Tottenham Mandem members), the Peckham Boys based in Peckham (with its various sets such as SN1, PYG, and OPB) and GAS Gang, based in Brixton, becoming notable in the road rap scene during the 2000s.\n\nThe road rap scene centres around mixtape releases and YouTube videos with some of the genres more popular acts getting mainstream recognition. The genre has been criticised for the relentless nihilism and violence in its lyrics as well as its links to gangs and gun crime with many rappers serving prison sentences. In keeping with grime, road rap has suffered from pre-emptive policing with Giggs claiming that the Metropolitan Police have set out to deny him the opportunity to make a living from music having banned him from touring. In 2011, Stigs was served the first ever gang injunction that banned him from rapping about anything that may encourage violence.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the American genre drill began to emerge in the UK, pushed by groups such as 150, 67, and Section Boyz. UK drill has been referred to as subgenre of road rap due to the influence it's had on the genre. Road rap also went on to influence afroswing, which emerged in the mid-2010s.\n\nSee also\n List of gangsta rap artists\n List of criminal enterprises, gangs, and syndicates\n Narcocorrido\n Road rap\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n\n \nHip hop genres\nCriticism of hip-hop\nHardcore hip hop\nAmerican styles of music\nMusic of New York City\nMusic of New York (state)\nMusic of California\nCompton, California\nAfrican-American culture\n1980s in music\n1990s in music\n2000s in music\n2010s in music\n2020s in music\nMusic controversies\nObscenity controversies in music\n1980s fads and trends\n1990s fads and trends\n2000s fads and trends\n2010s fads and trends\n2020s fads and trends", "machine_abstract": "Gangsta Rap is the genre of hip hop music that emerged in Los Angeles, California during the 1980s and became popular throughout much of the United States by 1990.

{"id": "Mohicans", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohicans", "title": "Mohicans", "text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n \nThey combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have a  reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived:  (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\"). The word  refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. \n\nThe Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the  (or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the \"Snake People\", as they were called by some competitors, or \"Five Nations\", representing their original tribes).  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on  in Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.\n\nTerritory\nIn their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , \"people of the great tidal river\".\n\nAt the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.\n\nMost of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.\n\nCulture\nThe Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).\n\nA general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.\n\nLike the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).\n\nLanguage\nThe now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.\n\nHistory\n\nMohican Confederacy\nThe Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.\n Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, \"the fireplace of the Mahican Nation\") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George\n , lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek\nWawyachtonoc (or ,  \"eddy people\" or \"people of the curving channel\"), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, Scaticook\n Westenhuck (from , \"on the other side of the mountains\"), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the \"Housatonic people\", they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning \"the place downstream\"\n Wiekagjoc (from , \"upper reaches of a river\"), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New York\n\nConflict with the Mohawk \n\nThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.\n\nIn September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed the  upriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.\n\nThe Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.\n\nWar continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahn\u00e9htati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.\n\nStockbridge\nMany Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the \"Stockbridge Indians\". , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.\n\nThe Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.  In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).  During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village of  in Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half \"Stockbridge Indians\" who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.  It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid $1,000 and dismissed.\n\nMove to Oneida, New York\nAfter the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted a  reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.\n\nRemoval to Wisconsin\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.\n\nLand claims\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for  in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly  in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.\n\nIn 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.\n\nRepresentation in media\nJames Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.\n\nNotable members\n Etow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.\n Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757\u20131830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captain\n Steve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activist\n Brent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautist \n Bill Miller, (b. 1955) musician\n Electa Quinney, (1798\u20131885) first public teacher and school mistress in Wisconsin\n John Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797\u20131855) diplomat\n Don Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.\n\nSee also \n Native American tribes in Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Aupaumut, Hendrick.

A 2\u20132\u20131 ACC record made the Wolfpack finish third in the conference, but they were playing in a bowl game for the fourth straight season.\n\nGame summary\nRickey Adams capped a 73-yard drive on the Wolfpack's first drive to give them an early lead. After the Wolfpack drove to the Mountaineer 10, they failed to get into the endzone, settling for a Jay Sherrill field goal to have a 10\u20130 lead with :53 left in the half. But West Virginia went on a quick drive and scored when Dan Kendra threw a 39-yard pass to Arthur Owens to make it 10\u20136 at halftime. While driving to take the lead in the 4th, Kendra threw a pass that was juggled by two defenders, which landed in the hands of receiver Scott MacDonald to give West Virginia the lead. With 3:49 to go, the Wolfpack tried one last desperate drive at their own 11 with a new quarterback, Dave Buckley. The Wolfpack managed to get to the WVU 33 and seemed to have a chance at a tie. But Buckley was sacked on the next play, which stuck them back at the 44, and a penalty on the next play sealed their fate. Ted Brown ran for 159 yards on 21 carries for NC State. Kendra went 12 of 28 for 202 yards and two touchdowns for WVU, and was named MVP. Despite having jumped out to a 10\u20130 lead, NC State was shut out in the second half.\n\nAftermath\nBoth coaches left for other jobs after this game, Holtz to the Jets and Bowden to Florida State. The Wolfpack went to two more bowl games in the decade. The Mountaineers did not return to a bowl game until 1981.\n\nStatistics\n\nReferences\n\nPeach Bowl\nPeach Bowl\nWest Virginia Mountaineers football bowl games\nNC State Wolfpack football bowl games\nDecember 1975 sports events in the United States\nPeach Bowl\n1970s in Atlanta", "machine_abstract": "The 1975 NCAA Division I-A football bowl game was the first of two consecutive games played at Orange Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana between Southern Mississippi and Georgia Tech on December 31, 1974.

{"id": "Nevadaplano", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevadaplano", "title": "Nevadaplano", "text": "Nevadaplano was a high plateau that covered parts of southwestern North America during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, located in the present-day US states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and possibly others. It most likely formed during the Cretaceous as a consequence of subduction dynamics and may have reached elevations of  and more. It was flanked on the west by the Sierra Nevada, which was traversed by various valleys that came down from the Nevadaplano. Closed basins and numerous volcanic calderas covered the relatively flat Nevadaplano; large volcanic eruptions distributed ignimbrites over the plateau and down the valleys draining it.\n\nDuring the Miocene, changes in the tectonic regime caused a collapse and dismemberment of the Nevadaplano. Tectonic extension gave rise to the Basin and Range province and separated the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block from the Nevadaplano, forming today's landscape.\n\nResearch history \n\nThe existence of the Nevadaplano was proposed in 2004 by DeCelles and named after the Altiplano high plateau of South America. It is also known as the \"Great Basin Altiplano\". Unlike the present-day Andean Altiplano and Tibetan plateau, the Nevadaplano was dismembered during the Cenozoic and thus its structure and evolution are poorly understood.\n\nGeologic history \n\nThe Nevadaplano probably formed as part of either the Sevier or the Laramide Orogeny during the Mesozoic and persisted into the Paleogene. Its growth began either in the Cretaceous or the Jurassic, when significant tectonic shortening took place behind the Sevier orogen. Similar to the present-day Altiplano in South America, the combination of an arid climate, tectonic contraction, weak erosion and the accumulation of volcanic rocks both in and below the crust helped raise the Nevadaplano during the Cretaceous, when flat subduction was taking place. Later its southern part was probably overprinted by the Laramide Orogeny when volcanism shifted far to the east. The exact geologic evolution of the Nevadaplano is controversial, however.\n\nThe Nevadaplano underwent extensional tectonics during the Cenozoic in a multi-step process. One stage occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene towards the end of subduction, when subduction steepened again and slab rollback decreased the tectonic forces. It is possible that at that time volcanic activity swept southwestward, away from the volcanoes of central Nevada to the Sierra. This was accompanied by uplift that may have peaked at the arrival of the Yellowstone hotspot.\n\nThe plateau overrode the heat source of the East Pacific Rise about 28 million years ago. After a delay, east\u2013west extension and northwestward shearing set in with major extension underway by 16-17 million years ago. The heat flow from the Yellowstone hotspot facilitated the collapse process. Only during the Miocene did the surface of the high plateau to significantly lose elevation. During the Miocene the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block separated from the Nevadaplano and was tilted to the west along the Sierra Escarpment, beheading a number of westward-going drainages in the process. Former drainages of the Nevadaplano were buried by volcanic rocks and disrupted by tectonic processes. Farther east, the dismemberment of the drainages may have created suitable environments for the evolution of sucker fish. Another stage in the Neogene is the well-known Basin and Range extension, triggered by changes in the plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. Presently, relic surfaces around the Middle Fork Feather River valley and the high elevations of the northern Basin and Range may be considered remnants of the Nevadaplano.\n\nThe Nevadaplano during its existence \n\nThe Nevadaplano was located in present-day Nevada and Utah, at the location of the present-day Great Basin, and may have extended from what is present-day central Idaho in the north either to Sonora or southern Nevada in the south. It was a high plateau consisting of a peneplain and reached a width of . Isotope analysis indicates that the Nevadaplano stood at high elevations, probably higher than or comparable to the then-Sierra Nevada. The elevation of the Nevadaplano exceeded , but the exact value is controversial. It was not entirely flat, and there is evidence of basins at its western margin although the relief of the Nevadaplano was probably smaller than that of the Altiplano.\n\nThe eastern Nevadaplano probably drained to internal basins such as the Uinta Basin, the Western Interior Seaway and westward to the Pacific Ocean. A drainage divide extended from the Mogollon Highlands in the south through the Kingman Uplift into the Nevadaplano. There is some uncertainty in the drainage directions across the Nevadaplano, with some evidence interpreted as indicating that drainage divides shifted over time and that the divide between Nevada and Idaho was offset along a Neoproterozoic lineament. Among the reconstructed drainages are the Tyee and Princeton Rivers from what is present-day north-central Idaho to present-day Oregon and northern California, the Idaho River also from present-day north-central Idaho to the Green River basin and the California River from present-day southernmost California to the Uinta Basin. The northernmost among these rivers may have formed the northern boundary of the Nevadaplano. Some closed drainages also existed, such as in the Elko basin, which formed in response to tectonic deformation.\n\nSome normal faulting took place within the Nevadaplano, along with the exposure of core complexes, and generated isolated basins. This may have created regional basins in the late Cretaceous similar to those that lie in the present-day Altiplano-Puna region, and which include the Sheep Pass Formation basin and the long-lived Elko Basin. Lake sediments and volcanic rocks accumulated in these basins. The formation of these basins may have been an early stage of the collapse of the Nevadaplano.\n\nGeographical and geological boundaries \n\nWest of the Nevadaplano stood the Sierra Nevada, which was volcanically active until 80 million years ago and featured exposed batholiths from former volcanism. Its exact elevation at the time is unclear, with alternate models proposing either that it had already reached a height similar to today's Sierra Nevada or that it rose to present-day height in the Miocene and Pliocene. Alternatively, the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-thrust belt may have formed the western boundary.\n\nIt probably did not constitute a drainage divide; various east\u2013west trending valleys cut across the Sierra Nevada at that time. Presently filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, these valleys were  wide,  deep with flat and deeply weathered bottoms. Among these valleys are the Nine Hill and Soda Springs valleys in the Lake Tahoe region and the Stanislaus, Mokelumne and Cataract paleochannels in the Sonora Pass region. There is more evidence for paleovalleys in the northern Sierra Nevada than in the southern, which may either indicate that evidence of cross-Sierra drainage was removed in its southern sector or that the southern Sierra was higher than the central and northern Sierra at the time of the Nevadaplano. Some of these rivers may have been large enough to allow sharks to reach Nevada. The rivers flowing through these valleys deposited the placer gold deposits of California, as part of intense westward sediment transport.\n\nRemnants of the Laramide uplands, the Chusca erg or the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt were located east of the Nevadaplano. The boundary was located at a region corresponding to the present-day Wasatch, Santaquin and Canyon Ranges. A relatively short distance may have separated it there from the Western Interior Seaway. The region of what today is northern Nevada during the Oligocene may have been a gently tilted or closed plateau. To the south, the California River may have separated the Nevadaplano from an analogous high plateau to the south, called \"Mexicoplano\" or \"Arizonaplano\". The Colorado Plateau was either to the east of the Nevadaplano or else formed an integral part of the plateau.\n\nGeology \n\nDuring the Miocene, volcanic activity covered the Nevadaplano with lahars, lava flows and volcanic sediments. In central Nevada and western Utah, at least 71 calderas located at high elevation erupted ignimbrites which propagated for over  westward and across former valleys in the Sierra Nevada, filling them in during the process. In particular, the 28.9 million year old Campbell Creek tuff covered an area of  and propagated far east and west of its source area.\n\nThe underlying crust had a sialic composition and reached thicknesses of . It consisted of metamorphic rocks and may have contained core complexes like these currently exposed in the Pequop Mountains of Nevada, as well as batholiths like the Idaho Batholith.\n\nEcosystems and climate \n\nBased on the fossils found in the Sheep Pass Formation, the Nevadaplano likely had a cold high-elevation climate. Located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, it was dry, and therefore experienced only weak erosion. The rain shadow extended east of the Nevadaplano. However, precipitation was enough to cut large valleys into the Sierra Nevada, perhaps aided by the then-warm climate. Pulses of erosion may have occurred during Paleogene climate disturbances, such as the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum. Vegetation with temperate climate affinities may have migrated from the Nevadaplano to California when the climate cooled during the Oligocene, founding the temperate forest communities of California.\n\nEvidence suggests that lakes and alluvial fans existed on the Nevadaplano, the Sheep Pass Formation constitutes the remnants of such landforms. It is not clear however if the Sheep Pass lake system was at high elevation. Fossils of anurans, birds, bivalves, crustaceans, frogs, lizards, mammals, molluscs, ostracods and snakes have been found there, as well as evidence of algae, charophytes, plants and microbial mats. There are also traces of physical events such as debris flows, periodic desiccation and storms. Lakes formed during the disassembly of the Nevadaplano as well, including these where the Truckee Formation diatomites were emplaced in.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGreat Basin\nMesozoic North America\nCenozoic North America\nNatural history of Nevada\nNatural history of California\nNatural history of Idaho\nNatural history of Utah\nGeology of Nevada\nGeology of Utah\nGeology of Idaho\nGeology of California\nCretaceous orogenies\nPaleogene orogenies", "machine_abstract": "The Nevadaplano is the name given to the high plateau of central and southern Nevada, which was formed by volcanic activity in the late Jurassic Period (about 150 million years ago).

{"id": "Pennine Way", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennine%20Way", "title": "Pennine Way", "text": "The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for  from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the \"backbone of England\". Although not the United Kingdom's longest National Trail (this distinction belongs to the  South West Coast Path), it is according to The Ramblers \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States of America, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the Daily Herald in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman's Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately  section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.\n\nThe Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series The Pennine Way was broadcast throughout April.\n\nUsage\n\nThe Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed \u00a32\u00a0million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.\n\nAccommodation is available at Youth Hostels, camp sites, B&Bs and pubs but are limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.\n\nThere are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.\n\nMost of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.\n\nRoute\n\nA survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges.  of the route is on public footpaths,  on public bridleways and  on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.\n\nPeak District National Park\n\nThe Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail  away.\n\nFrom Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.\n\nSouth Pennines\n\nFrom Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire\u2013Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about  west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.\n\nThe trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.\n\nFrom Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.\n\nYorkshire Dales National Park\n\nNorth of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle\u2013Carlisle Railway).\n\nThe Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle\u2013Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.\n\nThe path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the  ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.\n\nFrom Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.\n\nNorth Pennines\n\nAt Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God's Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.\n\nFrom Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.\n\nFrom Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at  the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.\n\nThe trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.\n\nNorthumberland National Park and the Scottish border\n\nOutside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian's Wall. For the next  the route coincides with the Hadrian's Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap,  west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.\n\nFrom the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.\n\nThe last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is  long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.\n\nRecords\nThe record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15\u201317 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).\n\nThe fastest women's time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14\u201317 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12\u201315 September 2020.\n\nThe route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.\n\nFurther reading \n\nThe Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to \u00a315,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.\nBarry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.\n\nImage gallery\n\nSee also\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPennine Way Official Site\nPennine Way Association\nPractical information for the walk\nMap of the Pennine Way in  segments\nPennine Way Companion Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\nThe Pennine Way Pint Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\n\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\nFootpaths in Northumberland\nFootpaths in the Scottish Borders\nFootpaths in West Yorkshire\nFootpaths in North Yorkshire\nFootpaths in Cumbria\nTourist attractions in County Durham\nPennines\nFootpaths in Derbyshire\nFootpaths in Yorkshire", "machine_abstract": "The Pennine Way is the longest of Britain's National Trails, running from Edale in Derbyshire to Kirk Yetholm on Tayside (1,260 mi/2,020 km).

Ascot Chang opened his first store on Kimberly Road in Hong Kong in 1953. It now has 15 locations across China, Hong Kong, the United States, and the Philippines. High-profile customers include former president George W. Bush, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Andy Warhol.\n\nHistory \nAscot Chang left his hometown, Fenghua, at age fourteen to apprentice under a master shirtmaker in Shanghai. In 1949, he left for Hong Kong where he started taking orders for custom made shirts. Knocking on door after door, he visited the offices of Shanghainese businessmen who were unable to find high quality shirts in Hong Kong.\n\nBy 1953, Ascot Chang opened his first  store at 34 Kimberley Road. He opened his first branch at the Peninsula Hotel in 1963, which is still open to this day.\n\nIn 1967, with sales negatively impacted by the Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots, Ascot Chang went on his first trunk show: over three months, he visited twenty cities in the United States, including San Francisco, Boston, and New York City.\n\nWhen Ascot Chang suffered a heart attack in the 1970s, his son, Tony Chang, and his brother, Johnny Chang, started leading the company. Under the second generation of Changs, Ascot Chang spread worldwide, with their first international store opening in New York in 1986.\n\nCurrently, Ascot Chang has 15 locations across China, Hong Kong, the United States, and the Philippines.\n\nStyle \nThe Ascot Chang house cut is a continental style that is characterized by medium shoulder padding, strong yet lightweight canvas structure, and a very slight roped shoulder. The styling leans towards a slim fit that balances aesthetics and comfort for a professional silhouette.\n\nReferences\n\nClothing companies established in 1953\n1953 establishments in Hong Kong\nClothing retailers of Hong Kong\nClothing brands of Hong Kong\nSuit makers", "machine_abstract": "The Ascot Chang is the first Chinese-built aircraft to enter service in Europe, and was used by British European Airways (BEA) from 1958 until 1974 on its London\u2013Hong Kong route.\nChang Aircraft Corporation of China built two prototypes as well as three production models between 1956 and 1959; all were supplied under licence to BEA who operated them using their own crews.

{"id": "Herbert Lankester", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert%20Lankester", "title": "Herbert Lankester", "text": "Herbert Lankester was an English medical missionary. He led the Church Missionary Society (CMS) for thirty years. His research shifted the role of medical missionaries from agents of religion to agents of health care, leading to the twentieth century model of medical missionaries.\n\nEarly life \nLankester was born in Elm Park Gardens, London, England and lived most of his life in England. It is unknown whether he had any formal education. Though his parents had no medical background, he grew up studying medicine on his own. It is believed that some member(s) of his family became ill, which influenced his interest. In early childhood, his mother battled multiple chronic diseases. Lankester wanted to help his mother get healthy. It is believed that she died while he was in his early teens and that he was brought up by his father. Without any siblings, most of Lankester's time was spent studying medicine.\n\nMissionary call \nLankester served as a leader for the Church Missionary Society examining board in addition to his role as a secretary. He retired in 1926 after serving there for 30 years  During this period, he served as Secretary of the Auxiliary Committee on Medical Missions, Society Physician, Home Secretary and General Secretary. He published numerous papers as the Honorary Secretary of Committee. In Occasional Paper 1, Lankester wrote an Appeal to the Medical Mission Auxiliary Fund Committee. Lankester worked as a researcher. He enjoyed reading and studying why people became ill. He read every book of medicine that was available at the time.\n\nHis work \nLankester was thoroughly involved with researching health care. He was especially interested in seeing how to better supply medicine to those who needed it around the world. As a long time London resident, Lankester focused his work on rural England. According to records, he supplied medical aid to the London countryside. He set up a tent on the side of one of the main roads outside a small village. He treated many different local people as well as people who traveled to seek his help. He had no real way of promoting his medical services beyond word of mouth. He treated people with a range of illnesses including smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, polio and diphtheria.\n\nHe started work in England and eventually branched out to other countries. Lankester apparently did not work closely with other medical missionaries, preferring to work independently. His greatest individual medical mission was a three-month stay in the London countryside.\n\nLegacy \nLankester was one of the first and most trusted medical missionaries. Instead of clergymen traveling the countryside, he wanted public perception of medical missionaries to be heroes spreading health and the Gospel. Lankester traveled across London communicating about medical missionaries. He had trouble conveying what medical missionary work was. He is best known for the studying and research he conducted, as well as his supply of medicine and vaccines to those in the near-London countryside.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n Arumugam, Thiru.

{"id": "Ski boot", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski%20boot", "title": "Ski boot", "text": "Ski boots are footwear used in skiing to provide a way to attach the skier to skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.\n\nHistory\n\nSki boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.\n\nModern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap around the back of the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.\n\nEffective cross-country skiing requires the boot to flex forward to allow a striding action, so the boots were designed around a sole piece that allowed forward flexing while still keeping the foot relatively firm side-to-side. The upper portions, the cuff, was relatively soft, designed primarily for comfort and warmth. Modern cross-country ski boots remain almost unchanged since 1950s, although modern materials have replaced leather and other natural fibres.\n\nWith the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank. New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful. Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the \"long thong\", a long leather strap fixed directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.\n\nAlpine\n\nModern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint system.\n\nFront-entry\nFront-entry (or \"top-entry\", rarely \"overlap\" or \"Lange\") boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing. The design evolved from existing leather boot through several steps.\n\nIn 1956, the Swiss factory Henke introduced the buckle boot, using over-center levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across a number of eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering the front of the boot.\n\nBeginning around 1960 Bob Lange experimented with ways to replace leather with plastic. Early examples used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots had a way of soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.\n\nAlmost all modern front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These are joined by rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, but not to the sides. This allows excellent control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as \"blowing\" (\"punching\", \"pushing\"). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way.\n\nRear-entry\nRear-entry boots were brought to market in the early 1970s by the Hanson brothers to address the issue of getting conventional boots on and off, while also providing a generally better fit. Rear-entry designs were very popular in the 1980s, notably Salomon designs like the racing-oriented SX 91 Equipe.\n\nIn the rear-entry design, the entire foot area and sole are a single unit similar to a slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear sections that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable \"slop\", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside of this approach is that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.\n\nThe rear entry design fell from popularity in the 1990s due to their shunning by racers in search of a closer fit. Recent improvements to front-entry and mid-entry boots, primarily in the areas of comfort and ease of entry/exit, have diminished the popularity of rear-entry designs even in recreational roles, though mid-range models remain common as rental boots.\n\nThree-piece\nThree-piece (or \"open-throat\") boots were first developed by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell in that year (Brixia did the same thing with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.\n\nBoot designer Sven Coomer later improved the design with a corrugated tongue, and this technique was commercialized by Comfort Products, an Aspen, Colo. company owned by the ex-ski racer Erik Giese. Giese licensed Coomer's concept to the Swiss company Raichle-Molitor; the company introduced it in 1979 as the Flexon, which became very popular among downhill racers and mogul skiers. The Flexon was extremely popular among professional skiers, especially for moguls and freestyle, but a series of business blunders put Raichle out of business in the late 1990s. Several companies produce three-piece designs today, often referred to as \"cabrio\" boots (after convertible-top cabriolet vehicles), and they are once again becoming popular models.\n\nThe design closely resembles a conventional front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening running down the front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening on the front of the boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the \"throat\") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.\n\nHybrid leather\nThe introduction of plastic boots in the 1960s led a number of companies to introduce \"hybrid\" boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.\n\nSide-entry\nIntroduced by Rosemount in 1965, side-entry design consisted of an almost completely enclosed shell with a cut-out section on one side. The cut-out was covered by a flap that hinged along the back of the boot, swinging to the rear to open. Stepping in was very easy, simply sliding the foot sideways in through the opening, then swinging the flap closed and stretching a fabric cover over it to seal it. As the upper and lower sections both opened, metal plates were needed on the sides to connect the two mechanically. A problem was that the boot did not meet perfectly along the join, allowing snow to force its way into the boot, although improvements were continuous. This design fell from use in the 1970s as higher-cuff front-entry boots became largely universal.\n\nExternal frames\nThe ski boot provides four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting point for the binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a soft boot that clipped into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control.\n\nKnee-highs\nIn 1980 four designs were introduced that all rose to a point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg using a variety of methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.\n\nNordic\n\nCross-country and telemark\nCross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm (\"three-pin\" binding, \"75NN\"), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. A new Salomon Pilot binding is now widely used for racing because it uses two connection points so that the skier has more stability and control over the ski. As these boots are intended for travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.\n\nTelemark refers to a specific technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with the front of the sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically. Since then plastic boots have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark boots. Plastic allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole.\n\nAlpine touring\n\nAlthough randonn\u00e9e is considered as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, with a stiff plastic boot offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding. Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means that they will not fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between alpine touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard.\n\nSnowboarding\n\nDownhill techniques, alpine, telemark and snowboarding, all perform turns by rotating the ski or board onto its edge. Once on edge, the curved pattern cut into the side (the \"sidecut\") causes the ski or board to bend into a curve. As they move forward over the snow, this curved shape causes them to turn.\n\nSnowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.\n\nSee also\nSki binding\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nBoots\nSports footwear\nBoot", "machine_abstract": "The ski boot is the part of the skiing equipment that fits around your foot and attaches to skis or snowboards, allowing you to glide down slopes on snow.\nSki boots are made from leather (or synthetic materials) uppers which cover most of the foot but leave room at heel height so as not to restrict movement in this area; they also have laces running across them.

It is a museum of the National Historical and Cultural Reserve \u201cHetman's Capital\u201d and the only architectural masterpiece of Charles Cameron in Ukraine.\n\nHistory \n\nKyrylo Rozumovsky was Hetman of Ukraine from 1750\u20131764. During his hetmanship the city of Baturyn became the hetman's capital. Since 1794 Kyrylo Rozumovsky lived in Baturyn. It was then that he conceived the construction of a grand palace and park ensemble. During 1799\u20131803, the ensemble was built according to the project of the famous architect of Scottish origin Charles Cameron.\nThe ensemble consisted of a palace, two outbuildings and a regular planning park. After the hetman's death, in 1803 the ensemble became the property of his son Andriy Rozumovsky, who owned it until the end of his life (1836). In 1824, a fire destroyed almost all the interiors of the building. In 1856 the palace and park ensemble became state property. At the beginning of the twentieth century the ensemble had an abandoned state.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century the park was completely destroyed and the outbuildings were dismantled.\n\nIn 1924, a severe fire broke out there, causing significant damage to the structure. The facade of the building and the decorative ornaments on it were also seriously damaged during the Great Patriotic War.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century several attempts were made to restore the palace, which supported its condition but no restoration was completed. The central building of the whole complex \u2013 the palace \u2013 has survived.\n\nIn 2003\u20132008, under the auspices of President Victor Yushchenko and with the charitable participation of Ukrainian philanthropists, Kyrylo Rozumovsky's palace was restored. On August 22, 2009 the grand opening of the Palace for visitors took place.\n\nMuseum exposition  \n\nThe total area of the palace is 2,483 m\u00b2, the exposition area is 1,065.3 m\u00b2.\n\nOn the ground floor of the palace there are exhibition halls, which represent the historical past of Hetman Baturyn through the prism of state activity of Kyrylo Rozumovsky and the history of construction and restoration of the palace and park ensemble in Baturyn.\n\nThe interiors of the second floor have been restored in analogy to the surviving works of Charles Cameron. In the ceremonial halls of the second floor, the focus is on the era of the Hetmanate.\n\nAmong the original exhibits belonging to Hetman Kyrylo Rozumovsky and his family, the palace exhibits:\n\n basket hilted sword, lab-company of the XVIII century, which belonged to Kyrylo Rozumovsky. The sword was kept in the Rozumowski family in Vienna.

Cuban music was a part of Nelson's childhood, and through his life in Cuba, Latin dance became a family tradition, passed from father to son.\n\nHe trained in dance alongside his regular studies at specialised dance courses in the Casa de Cultura community centre.\n\nHe studied economics, and studied languages to a high level. After moving to England in the 1980s, he did some work for Dunn & Co., before taking up a serious career in Salsa dance.\n\nCareer \nIn 1988 Nelson became actively involved in promoting and organising Latin dance and music activities in London.

{"id": "Nusach (Jewish custom)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusach%20%28Jewish%20custom%29", "title": "Nusach (Jewish custom)", "text": "In Judaism, Nusach ( nusa\u0127, modern pronunciation nusakh or n\u00fasakh), plural nuschaot () or nusachim () refers to the exact text of a prayer service; sometimes the English word \"rite\" is used to refer to the same thing. Texts used by different communities include Nosach Teiman, Nusach Ashkenaz, Nusach Sefard, Nusach Edot Hamizrach, and Nusach Ari. In English, the word nusach means formulate, wording. \n\nTextual nusach is distinct from musical nusach, which refers to the musical style or tradition of a community, particularly the chant used for recitative prayers such as the Amidah.\n\nMeanings\nNusach primarily means \"text\" or \"version\", the correct wording of a religious text or liturgy. Thus, the nusach tefillah is the text of the prayers, either generally or in a particular community.\n\nIn common use, nusach has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is one example of minhag, which includes traditions on Jewish customs of all types.\n\nVarieties\n\nNusach Ashkenaz\n\nNusach Ashkenaz is the style of service conducted by Ashkenazi Jews, originating from central and eastern Europe. It is the shortest lengthwise (except for the \"Baladi\" Yemenite Nusach).\n\nIt may be subdivided into the German, or western, branch (\"Minhag Ashkenaz\"), used in western and central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian branch (\"Minhag Polin\"), used in eastern Europe, the United States and among Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as \"Lithuanian\", in Israel.\n\nThe form used in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (except Canada, which follows the American style), known as \"Minhag Anglia\"  \nis technically a subform of \"Minhag Polin\" but has many similarities to the German rite. See Singer's Siddur.\n\nNusach Sefard\n\nNusach Sefard is the style of service used by some Jews of central and eastern European origins, especially Hasidim, who adopted some Sephardic customs emulating the practice of the Ari's circle of kabbalists, most of whom lived in the Land of Israel. Textually speaking it is based on the Sephardic rite, but in melody and feel it is overwhelmingly Ashkenazi.\n\nNusach Ari\n\nNusach Ari is a variant of Nusach Sefard, used by Chabad Hasidim.\n\nSephardi and Mizrachi nuschaot\n\nThere is not one generally recognized uniform nusach for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews.  Instead, Sephardim and Mizrahim follow several slightly different but closely related nuschaot.\n\nThe nearest approach to a standard text is found in the siddurim printed in Livorno from the 1840s until the early 20th century.  These (and later versions printed in Vienna) were widely used throughout the Sephardic and Mizrahi world.  Another popular variant was the text known as Nusach ha-Hida, named after Chaim Yosef David Azulai.  Both these versions were particularly influential in Greece, Iran, Turkey and North Africa.  However, most communities also had unwritten customs which they would observe, rather than following the printed siddurim exactly: it is easy, from the printed materials, to get the impression that usage in the Ottoman Empire around 1900 was more uniform than it really was.\n\nOther variants include:\nthe customs of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, based on an older form of the Castilian rite, with some influence from the customs both of Italian Jews and of Northern Morocco.  This version is distinguished by the near-absence of Kabbalistic elements.\nNusah Adot Hamizrah, originating among Iraqi Jews but now popular in many other communities.  These are based on the opinions of Yosef Hayyim and have a strong Kabbalistic flavour.\nMinhag Aram Soba, as used by Syrian Musta'arabi Jews in earlier centuries (the current Syrian rite is closely based on the Livorno prints).\nthe Moroccan rite, also related to the text of the Livorno prints but with a strong local flavour.  This subdivides into the customs of the Spanish-speaking northern strip and the Arabic-speaking interior of the country.\nformerly, there were variants from different parts of Spain and Portugal, perpetuated in particular synagogues in Thessaloniki and elsewhere, e.g. the Lisbon and Catalan rites, and some North African rites appear to reflect Catalan as well as Castilian influence.\n\nUnder the influence of the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, many Israeli Sephardim have adopted a nusach based largely on the Nusach Edot Hamizrach but omitting some of the Kabbalistic additions.\n\nNosach Teman\n\nA \"Temani\" nosach was the standard among the Jews of Yemen. This is divided into the Baladi (purely Yemenite) and Shami (adopted from Sephardic siddurim) versions. Both rites are recited using the unique Yemenite pronunciation of Hebrew, which Yemenite Jews, and some scholars, regard as the most authentic, and most closely related to the Hebrew of Ancient Israel.\n\nThe Baladi rite is very close to that codified by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah. One form of it is used by the Dor Daim, who attempt to safeguard the older Baladi tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance. This version used by dardaim was originally used by all Yemenite Jews near the time of Maimonides.\n\nNussach Eretz Yisrael\nIn the period of the Geonim, Jews in Israel followed the Nussach Eretz Yisrael which is based upon the Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud), while the Jewish diaspora followed the customs of Babylonian Jewry. \n\nThe modern Nusach Eretz Yisrael is a recent attempt by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim at reconstructing the ancient Nussach Eretz Yisrael, based on the Jerusalem Talmud and documents discovered in the Cairo Geniza and other sources. The reconstruction is published in the form of a siddur (\"prayer book\"), and used by Rabbi Bar-Hayim's Jerusalem followers in public prayers held in Machon Shilo's synagogue.\n\nOther nuschaot\nIn addition, there are other nuschaot.\nNussach HaGR\"A was a very brief version of Nussach Ashkenaz written by the Vilna Gaon, removing some passages which he believed had were not in the original prayer text, correcting some grammatical errors (according to him), and some additional small changes.\nThe Minhag Italiani and Minhag Ben\u00e8 Rom\u00ec are used by some Italian Jews, as well as by a small number of minyanim in Jerusalem and Netanya.\nClosely related to these was the \"Romaniote\" rite from  Greece where have lived an ancient, pre-Diaspora Jewish community.  The surviving Romaniote synagogues are in Ioannina, Chalkis, Athens, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and New York, these now use a Sephardic rite but with romaniote variations, romaniote piyyutim, combined with own melodies and customs and their special form of Byzantine-Jewish Cantillation.  There were formerly Romaniote synagogues in Istanbul. (The customs of Corfu are a blend between Romaniote, Apulian and Sephardic rites.)\nThere was once a French nusach, closely related to the Ashkenazi, which is now used only in certain towns in Northern Italy (see Appam).\nDistinct Persian and Proven\u00e7al nuschaot also existed before being gradually replaced by the Edot Hamizrach and Spanish and Portuguese nuschaot respectively.\n The Urfalim Jews of south eastern Anatolia follow their own prayer rite, which differs from the Syrian, Kurdish and Iraqi Jewish rites.\n\nIt is said among some mystics that an as-yet undisclosed nusach will be revealed after the coming of the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah. Others say that the differences in nusach are derived from differences between the twelve tribes of Israel, and that in Messianic times each tribe will have its proper nusach. The concept of one nusach for each of the 12 tribes was formulated by R' Isaac Luria; at the time there were exactly 12 Jewish communities in Luria's city of Safed, and each community's nusach was meant to stand in place of that of one of the tribes.\n\nHalakhot\n\nAccording to Rabbi David Bar-Hayim, halakha permits a Jew to change his nusach at any time, even on a daily basis.

{"id": "Nomos Glash\u00fctte", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomos%20Glash%C3%BCtte", "title": "Nomos Glash\u00fctte", "text": "NOMOS Glash\u00fctte is a German watchmaking company based in Glash\u00fctte, Saxony, which specializes in artisan manual-winding and automatic mechanical watches. It was founded in January 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by Roland Schwertner. The designs for the first collection were drawn up by Susanne G\u00fcnther, drawing influence from the Bauhaus purist style. NOMOS designs are known for their clean and modernist aesthetic. NOMOS Glash\u00fctte is a member of the Deutscher Werkbund, a predecessor of the Bauhaus movement and a group that represents the interests of companies that combine handcraft with industrial production, and design with functionality. The management team is made up of CEO Uwe Ahrendt, a graduate engineer and responsible for production; Judith Borowski, heading up communications and design in Berlin; and Roland Schwertner, who continues to be in charge of sales.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1990, Roland Schwertner, an IT expert and photographer from D\u00fcsseldorf, registered the trademark NOMOS Glash\u00fctte/SA. The first collection of NOMOS watches came out in 1992. NOMOS Glash\u00fctte now has three sites in Glash\u00fctte, a place renowned for its tradition of watchmaking: The administration department can be found in the former Glash\u00fctte station building, while most of the watchmakers are located on Am Erbenhang street. Since 2017, a further manufacturing facility can be found in the Schlottwitz district. Annual production is approximately 20,000 pieces. In its early years, the company focused on manufacturing mechanical watches with hand-wound movements. The basis for these movements was, until 2005, the Swiss-made ETA SA / Peseux 7001. Since April 2005, NOMOS Glash\u00fctte has only used in-house movements. Beginning with \u03b1 (Alpha), a manual winding caliber, the range has since been expanded to include a range of other manual winding movements with additional functions. The first automatic NOMOS watch, the Tangomat, was first introduced in the summer of 2005.\n\nIn 2014, the company unveiled its own in-house escapement, known as the NOMOS swing system, which made it no longer reliant on Swiss manufacturers. This new component was gradually introduced into NOMOS\u2019 caliber range. Since 2016, the company has concentrated on upgrading its caliber range with the NOMOS swing system; once upgraded, the calibers receive a name beginning with \"DUW\". This acronym stands for \"Deutsche Uhrenwerke\" and is intended to highlight the company's in-house caliber production.\n\nThe calibers in the company's neomatik (\u201cnew automatic\u201d) series are very thin: NOMOS Glash\u00fctte introduced DUW 3001, its tenth in-house caliber, in 2015. At only 3.2\u00a0mm in height, this caliber is exclusive to the neomatik series, launched at BaselWorld 2016. The latest movement, DUW 6101, or \u201cneomatik date,\u201d was introduced in 2018. In this year the company also introduced the models Autobahn and Tangente Update, which debuted the neomatik date caliber. At BaselWorld 2019, the company introduced three new collections: the duo series, three new sport watches (two versions of Tangente Sport and one of Club Sport), and three automatic Club Campus models.\n\nModels \nThe brand started production in 1992 with four basic models (Tangente, Orion, Ludwig, and Tetra). NOMOS Glash\u00fctte has since gradually expanded its range of watches to include new models and sizes, such as Club and Metro. In 2013 the company introduced two gold models to its collection, Lambda and Lux. There are currently thirteen NOMOS watch models, which come in a number of variations. These are:\n\nTangente (1992): originally hand-wound with optional date function, power reserve indicator, white or champagne-colored dial, in 33, 35,  38, 39, and 41\u00a0mm diameter; also available as a limited edition for Doctors Without Borders in the UK, USA, and Germany\nTetra (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, power reserve indicator, various dial colors, in 27, 29.5, and 33\u00a0mm diameter; also available as a special edition for Doctors Without Borders in Germany\nOrion (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, various dial colors, in 33, 35, 38, 39, and 41\u00a0mm diameter\nLudwig (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or champagner dial, in 33, 35, 38, and 41\u00a0mm diameter\nTangomat (2005): automatic in 38\u00a0mm diameter with optional date function, white or dark-colored dial, and world time function\nClub (2007): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or dark-colored dial, in 36, 38, and 40\u00a0mm diameter\nZurich (2009): automatic in 40\u00a0mm diameter with optional date function, various dial colors, and world time function\nAhoi (2013): automatic, 36 or 40\u00a0mm in diameter with water-resistance to 20 atm, optional date function, and various dial color options\nLux (2013): hand-wound shape watch in 18 kt white or rose gold, various dial colors, in two sizes: 40.5 \u00d7 36\u00a0mm and 38.5 \u00d7 34\u00a0mm\nLambda (2013): hand-wound watch in 18 kt white or rose gold; black, deep blue or off-white dial, in two sizes: 39 and 42\u00a0mm diameter\nMetro (2014): hand-wound in 35, 37, 38, or 39\u00a0mm diameter with date, power reserve indicator, and various dial color options\nMinimatik (2015): automatic in 35.5\u00a0mm diameter, available in white, champagne, or midnight blue\nAutobahn (2018): automatic in 41\u00a0mm diameter with date function, superluminova on dial, and three dial color options\n\nCalibers \n\nNOMOS Glash\u00fctte owns multiple patents for their calibers, such as for the in-house date mechanism, power reserve display and for the proprietary escapement, the NOMOS swing system. NOMOS Glash\u00fctte currently produces eleven in-house calibers with various complications. These are:\n\nManual \n\n\u03b1 (Alpha), 43-hour power reserve / Alpha.2 (found in the duo series), with a shorter pivot on the second wheel\nDUW 1001, power reserve indicator, 84-hour power reserve\nDUW 2002, tonneau shape, 84-hour power reserve\nDUW 4101, NOMOS swing system, date indicator, 42-hour power reserve\nDUW 4301, NOMOS swing system, power reserve indicator, 43-hour power reserve\nDUW 4401, NOMOS swing system, power reserve indicator, date indicator, 42-hour power reserve\n\nAutomatic \n\nneomatik DUW 3001, NOMOS swing system, 42-hour power reserve\nDUW 5001, NOMOS swing system, 43-hour power reserve\nDUW 5101, NOMOS swing system, date indicator, 42-hour power reserve\nDUW 5201, NOMOS swing system, worldtimer function, 24-hour indicator, 42-hour power reserve\nneomatik date DUW 6101, NOMOS swing system, date indicator, 42-hour power reserve\n\nThe NOMOS Glash\u00fctte movements have a Glash\u00fctte three-quarter plate, are rhodium-plated and refined with Glash\u00fctte ribbing and NOMOS perlage. Further special features include: stop-seconds mechanism, fine adjustment in six positions, Glash\u00fctte-style NOMOS stopwork, tempered blue screws, sunburst finish on the ratchet and crown wheel. Additional features of the movements DUW 1001 and 2002: swan neck fine adjustment, hand-engraved balance cock, screwed gold chatons, 84-hour power reserve, twin mainspring barrel, screw balance.\n\nAwards\nNOMOS watches have won more than 150 prestigious design awards to date (as of December 2018), including the iF Design Award, the Good Design Award, the red dot Design Award, and the German Design Award. In 2018, NOMOS Glash\u00fctte became the first non-Swiss brand after A. Lange & S\u00f6hne to win the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve (GPHG), the Oscars of the watchmaking world, with the Tangente Update model\u2014which has also been awarded the European Product Design Award (EPDA).\n\nOther \n\"Nomos\" means law or rule in Greek. In 1906, a company called \"Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft, Guido M\u00fcller & Co.\" started importing Swiss watches and distributing them with the more prestigious addition \u201cGlash\u00fctte/Sachsen\u201d. For a watch company to include \u201cGlash\u00fctte\u201d in their name, at least 50% of the caliber must be manufactured in Glash\u00fctte; this is up to 95% for NOMOS Glash\u00fctte, but was not the case for the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft. The renowned company A. Lange & S\u00f6hne took them to court and in 1910 the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft ceased business operations. The Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft from the early 1900s and today's NOMOS Glash\u00fctte have nothing more than the name Nomos in common.\n\nLiterature \n Schmid, Hans Heinrich: Lexikon der Deutschen Uhrenindustrie 1850 - 1980 : \n Design Klassiker, Die Tangente von NOMOS Glash\u00fctte, .\n NOMOS Glash\u00fctte - Das gro\u00dfe Universallexikon Berlin: Birkh\u00e4user 2004, .\n Doerr, Elizabeth: Bravo, NOMOS!

{"id": "Mnesia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnesia", "title": "Mnesia", "text": "Mnesia is a distributed, soft real-time database management system written in the Erlang programming language.  It is distributed as part of the Open Telecom Platform.\n\nDescription \nAs with Erlang, Mnesia was developed by Ericsson for soft real-time distributed and high-availability computing work related to telecoms. It was not intended as a general office-based data processing database management system, nor to replace SQL-based systems. Instead Mnesia exists to support Erlang, where DBMS-like persistence is required. It has more in common with embeddable DBMS such as Berkeley DB than with any SQL database server.\n\nDatabase model \n\"Rows\" in tables are represented as records that contain a key value and a data field. This data field may in turn be a tuple containing an Erlang data structure of any complexity.\n\nBackend types \nMnesia has three inbuilt table types: ram_copies, disc_copies and disc_only_copies.\n\nRam_copies \nData resides in memory and table size is limited by available memory and are backed by ETS (erlang term storage) table.\n\nDisc_copies \nData resides in memory but is also persisted on disk backed by disk_log. Disc_copies were backed by Dets tables until 30th September 2001 with the release of R7B-4.\n\nDisc_only_copies \nData resides only on disc and are backed by Dets (disk version of ETS). Dets file format uses signed 32-bit integers for file offsets and has a limit of 2GB so do disc_only_copies.\n\nBackend plugins \nDue to limits imposed by Dets, support for other backend plugins was suggested by Ulf Wiger and these were added to Mnesia. Klarna added the LevelDB backend plugin while Aeternity added the RocksDB backend plugin.\n\nRelational features \nThe database model is relational, but isn't what someone familiar with SQL might expect. A database contains tables. Relationships between them are modelled as other tables.\n\nA key feature of Mnesia's high-availability approach is that tables can be reconfigured within a schema and relocated between nodes, not only while the database is still running, but even while write operations are still going on.\n\nCoding  \nThe query language of Mnesia is Erlang itself, rather than SQL. It permits easy representation of transactions as a natural feature of Erlang by allowing developers to utilize a single language throughout an application.\n\nTransactions \nErlang is a functional language. Mnesia builds on this to obtain ACID transaction support. The functional block which is run as a transaction is a commonplace Erlang construct called a Functional Object (or Fun) and is called by the single Mnesia statement mnesia:transaction(F). This can lead to clearer source code than the paired BEGIN / COMMIT syntax of SQL, and so avoids its problem of unclosed transactions within a procedure.\n\nAgain as a result of the functional nature of Erlang, nesting transactions is simple. It's also possible to distribute transactions across multiple nodes (i.e. separate servers). The semantics of using transactions in this way remains consistent, making it easy to write library code that works equally in either context.\n\nGeneral coding style for Mnesia will always use transactions. For performance reasons, it also supports deliberate \"dirty operations\" which avoid transactions. These compromise the atomicity and the isolation properties of ACID, but offer around 10\u00d7 more throughput. In addition there are also in-memory alternatives, although these lose the durability property of ACID.\n\nEfficient execution \nMnesia forms part of the LYME web application stack. This is akin to LAMP, but based on Erlang. Implementation in Erlang confers an efficiency benefit because of the use of a single virtual machine throughout an application. LYME makes use of this, since the Yaws web server is also implemented in Erlang.\n\nAddress space is shared (although safely so, under Erlang) between code and data, including Mnesia's table data.\n\nOrigins and licensing \nMnesia and Erlang were developed by the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. They have been released as open source software. Mnesia is released under a derivative of the Mozilla Public License. Since OTP 18.0 they are published according to the open source Apache License 2.0. Versions before OTP 18.0 were published under the open source Erlang Public License.\n\nejabberd \nMnesia is also an option embedded within the Erlang-based Jabber daemon, ejabberd.\n\nSee also \n\n Riak\n Apache Cassandra\n Couchbase\n CouchDB\n LYME (software bundle)\n\nReferences \n\nErlang (programming language)\nFree database management systems\nStructured storage", "machine_abstract": "Mnesia is the loss of memory, or amnestic disorder.\nIt can be caused by brain injury (traumatic), stroke and other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, alcoholism-related dementia, Down syndrome-associated dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, HIV infection/AIDS associated neurocognitive disorders, vascular dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, prion diseases including mad cow disease/encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, metabolic disturbances like diabetes mellitus type 2, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies etc., infections in the central nervous system, autoimmune conditions affecting the brain, tumors, genetic mutations causing hereditary forms of dementia, head trauma due to accidents, childbirth complications during pregnancy, birth injuries, poisoning from heavy metals, carbon monoxide inhalation, exposure to radiation, organophosphate insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, fungal toxins, bacterial endotoxins, viral infections, parasitic infestations, toxic substances ingestion, drug overdose, withdrawal syndromes, electroconvulsive therapy side effects, sleep deprivation, emotional distress, extreme fatigue, heatstroke, hypoglycemia, hyperthermia, hypoxia, drowning, near-drowning, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, shock, status epilepticus, cerebral malaria, meningitis, encephalitis, rabies, syphilis, botulism, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, post-concussional syndrome, transient global amnesia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and many others.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Mnesia\".

{"id": "Andreas Heusler", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas%20Heusler", "title": "Andreas Heusler", "text": "Andreas Heusler (10 August 1865 \u2013 28 February 1940) was a Swiss philologist who specialized in Germanic studies. He was a Professor of Germanic Philology at the University of Berlin and a renowned authority on early Germanic literature.\n\nLife \nAndreas Heusler was born into a prestigious family in Basel, the third in a line of fathers and sons bearing the same name (his father was Andreas Heusler (1834\u20131921) and his grandfather Andreas Heusler (1802\u20131868); both worked in law and government). Andreas enjoyed a stellar career as a student in Basel, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Berlin, completing his studies in 1887 in Freiburg with the doctoral thesis \"Beitrag zum Consonantismus der Mundart von Baselstadt\".\n\nIn 1890, when Heusler was 25 years old, he began lecturing in Berlin and was a professor of Nordic textual studies there from 1894 to 1913. He focused on research into Old Norse literature, especially the Poetic Edda and \u00cdslendingas\u00f6gur, translating many works into German and travelling twice to Iceland. From 1914 to 1919, Heusler was professor of Germanic textual studies at Berlin University. He moved back to Switzerland in 1920 and lived in Arlesheim near Basel, where a place was made for him at Basel University, where he worked until he reached the age limit in 1936. \n \nBesides ancient Germanic and Nordic culture, Heusler was noted for his love of music (he played the violin); around 1889 he switched from a strongly held Christianity to being a confirmed atheist. There is some debate as to where Heusler stood on German nationalism in the 1930s. He seems at first to have been swayed by it, but it is thought that he turned his back on Adolf Hitler around 1938. A good insight into his thoughts is offered by the four hundred letters to Wilhelm Ranisch which he wrote in the period 1890\u20131940.\n\nIn 1893, Heusler married the singer Auguste Hohenschild, who was fourteen years his senior. The marriage was unhappy and they divorced in 1922, having been separated since 1901. Heusler died in Basel in 1940 after a short illness.\n\nInfluence \nAndreas Heusler was among the most influential figures in early Germanic studies in the first half of the twentieth century, and much of his work still resonates today.\n\nWritings (selection) \n Der Lj\u00f3\u00feah\u00e1ttr, eine metrische untersuchung, Berlin: Mayer & M\u00fcller 1889.\n (Ed.): Zwei Isl\u00e4nder-Geschichten.

{"id": "Social order", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20order", "title": "Social order", "text": "The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.\n\nSociology\nThomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract.\nSocial theorists (such as Karl Marx, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action.\n\nPrinciple of extensiveness\nAnother key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole.\n\nA good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community.\n\nGroups and networks\nIn every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order.\n\nSome people belong to more than one group, and this can sometimes cause conflict. The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another. Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole, and to promote pride within each group. Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group, enabling social norms and values to be reinforced.\n\nStatus groups\n\"Status groups\" can be based on a person's characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as \"a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low.\" One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a garbage man.\n\nA certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups.\n\nSmaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed.\n\nValues and norms\nValues can be defined as \"internal criteria for evaluation\". Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers.\nNorms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally\u00a0\u2013 or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation.\n\nPower and authority\nAn exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality. \n\nIn a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes.\n\nSpontaneous order\nThe order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government.  Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems.  These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person.  This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control.  These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare.  Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order.  In his researching, he found that \"when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,\" as stated in \"Theories of Social Order\", edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne.\n\nSocial honor\nSocial honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or \"the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances\". The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire.\n\nAttainment\nTwo different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is \"order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,\" as stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that \"the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize.\" also stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.\n\nSee also\n\n Anti-social behaviour\n Antinomianism\n Conformity\n Marx's theory of history\n Norm (sociology)\n Social hierarchy\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n Hobbes, T.

In 1974 he started to work for Sara Lee, where he ultimately became the president of the board of directors.\n\nOn 31 December 1993 he withdrew from Sara Lee. In the beginning of 1994 he was asked by former Philips top executive Jan Timmer to participate in the Board of Directors of Philips, to breathe new life to the brand Philips. Boonstra was responsible for the 'Let's make things better'- campaign.\n\nTwo years after his commencement of employment with Philips, Boonstra became the successor of Timmer as the president of the board of directors. He held this leading position until 2001. While Boonstra was in charge, the market-value of Philips increased fivefold mainly by focusing on short-term profits and selling off company units like BSO/Origin (now a part of Atos and record company PolyGram. During his leadership he moved the head office (the top 350 employees) of Philips from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, the capital of the country. Since most of the regular staff remained in Eindhoven, the birthplace of the company, this move was not popular among Philips employees. In 2000 Boonstra was chosen 'top executive of the year'. Boonstra divorced two times, and has two children (Cor Boonstra and Roelof Boonstra) of his first wife.\n\nIn 1998 Boonstra and his first wife barely survived a hijacking. At that time Boonstra already was having an affair with Sylvia T\u00f3th. A few years later, Boonstra was accused of insider trading in which he allegedly earned several hundreds of thousands of euros by trading in Endemol shares (where Sylvia T\u00f3th was a member of the board) just before that company was acquired by the Spanish Telef\u00f3nica. Boonstra was ultimately acquitted in court as no hard evidence existed that his partner T\u00f3th had shared the information on the impending deal with him. The Dutch press referred to the inside deal as the \"pillow talk deal\".\n\nA few months later Cor Boonstra was again charged for not reporting trading in Ahold shares where he himself was a member of the board. He was found guilty and charged a 135.000 euro fine.\n\nReferences \n Encyclopedia, Dutch Wikipedia, Article Cor Boonstra, User Falcongj, added 2 January 2004, last edit 4 April 2009\n\nExternal links\n Philips Global - access to worldwide local sites, research, consumer products, Healthcare, lighting etc.\n\nNotes\n\n1938 births\nLiving people\nDutch chief executives in the manufacturing industry\nDutch chief executives in the technology industry\nDutch chief executives in the food industry\nDutch businesspeople\nPhilips employees\nChairmen of Philips\nDutch corporate directors\nUnilever people\nPeople from Leeuwarden", "machine_abstract": "Cor Boonstra (born in Amsterdam, Netherlands) is the founder and CEO of Cor Group International BVBA which owns several companies including Cor Global Investments NV, Cor Capital Partners LLC., Cor Asset Management SA de CV, Cor Real Estate Investment Trust PLC, Cor Property Funds Limited, Cor Securities Ltd.

{"id": "Jin-go-lo-ba", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-go-lo-ba", "title": "Jin-go-lo-ba", "text": "\"Jin-go-lo-ba\" (or \"Jingo\") is a song by Nigerian percussionist Babatunde Olatunji,  featured on his first album Drums of Passion (1959). In Yoruba (Olatunji's native language) it means, \"Do not worry.\"\n\nThe song featured \"African-derived rhythms and chants\" along with \"swooping orchestration\". In his autobiography, Olatunji said that this was the only song on his first album that he claimed formal ownership of, meaning that it was the only song he received royalties for. American disc jockey Francis Grasso described the song as \"rhythmically sensual\".\n\nMedia\n\nIt has been featured on the Wii playable dance-game, Just Dance.\n\nCover versions\n\nIt has been covered by Serge Gainsbourg, under the title \"Marabout\" and with no credit given to Olatunji, on his Gainsbourg Percussions LP (1964). \nThe song was also covered by James Last on his album Voodoo-Party (1971), by Pierre Moerlen's Gong on their Downwind album (1979), Candido Camero (aka Candido) on his Dancin' & Prancin''' album (1979), by Steve Lee on his album FKW - Jingo (1994) and by Fatboy Slim on his album Palookaville (2004). A cover version was also released by independent dance act the Ravish Brothers (featuring a Hot Funky Daddy Groove) in 1988, in Lightwater, Surrey. The song was also featured in the Hindi serial \"Chandrakanta\" that aired on DD.\n\nIn January 1988 a hit cover version by Jellybean (John Benitez), from his album Just Visiting This Planet'', peaked at no. 12 during a ten-week run on the UK singles chart.\n\nSantana version\n\nThe song was also covered by Santana, on their first album (1969), though Grasso noted this version was not as popular as the original. Spanish journalist Jose Miguel L\u00f3pez stated that when Santana released \"Jingo\" as a single, it was first credited to Carlos Santana. Only years later the credits were corrected. Other multiple editions of Santana's Jingo single, viewable under a Google image search for it, list the composer as A. Copland, evidently confusing this song with Part V. of composer Aaron Copland's \"Statements for Orchestra,\" which is unrelated.\n\nReferences\n\n1959 songs\n1969 debut singles\nSantana (band) songs\nFatboy Slim songs", "machine_abstract": "The Korean War (Korean: \ud55c\uad6d\uc804\uc7c1; Hanja: \u97d3\u6230) was fought between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, commonly known as North Korea or simply North, and South Korea from 25 June 1950 to 27 July 1953.

{"id": "Colin Grainger", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin%20Grainger", "title": "Colin Grainger", "text": "Colin Grainger (born 10 June 1933) is an English former international footballer, as well as being a former singer and recording artist. As a footballer he played as an outside left and had a 16-year career in the Football League from 1950 to 1966. He came from a footballing family: brother Jack Grainger, brother-in-law Jim Iley, and first cousins Dennis Grainger, Jack Grainger and Edwin Holliday all played professionally. He got married in 1956 and has two children.\n\nRaised in the mining village of Havercroft, he was working as a car mechanic when he was signed on apprentice forms at Third Division North club Wrexham in July 1949. He turned professional the following year and made his first-team debut in February 1951. Though National Service prevented him from establishing himself at the club he still managed to build a reputation as an exciting young prospect and was purchased by Sheffield United for a \u00a32,500 fee in June 1953. A regular in the starting eleven in the First Division, he was called up for the first of his seven England caps in May 1956. His international career lasted just 11 months, though he did score two goals against Brazil and one against West Germany. He was also twice selected for The Football League XI.\n\nHis career then declined as he struggled with an ankle injury sustained on England duty and he was sold on to Sunderland for \u00a317,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at \u00a36,000) in February 1957. Sunderland were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1957\u201358 season and he was sold on to Leeds United of the Second Division for a club record \u00a315,000 in July 1960. His damaged ankle hindered his form at Leeds and he was sold on to Third Division side Port Vale in October 1961 for \u00a36,000. He helped Vale to knock former club Sunderland out of the FA Cup the following January, but missed the end of the season with a groin injury that dogged him for the remainder of his time at Vale Park. He was not retained at the end of the 1963\u201364 season and signed with Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in August 1964. He made 41 appearances across the 1964\u201365 campaign, though was dropped the following season and was released in summer 1966. He then had a brief spell with Macclesfield Town in the Cheshire County League, before retiring to focus on his singing career. He later spent 1969 to 1972 as player-manager of non-league village team Newmillerdam, before playing for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978.\n\nGrainger performed his first professional music gig in 1956, supporting the Hilltoppers. He appeared on television and radio, and also had a ghostwritten column in the Sport Express. He was signed with the HMV label and released \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958. His footballing career restricted his singing opportunities, though he did share a bill with the Beatles in June 1963. He ended his singing career in August 1970 in order to focus on his new career in sales. He also supplemented his income scouting for a succession of clubs: Barnsley, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nEarly and personal life\nBorn in the mining village of Havercroft on 10 June 1933, his father \u2013 Daniel Grainger (1894\u20131967) \u2013 was a coal miner at Monckton Colliery. He had five older brothers: Leslie (born 1920), George (born 1922), Jack (born 1924), Eric (born 1926) and Horace (born 1929), though Leslie and George both died before he was born. His mother, Lily Grainger (n\u00e9e Holliday; 1900\u201379), gave birth to a total of seven children, with the one daughter also named Lily (born 1935). He represented Barnsley boys' team during the 1946\u201347 season, alongside future Munich air disaster victim Tommy Taylor and cricket umpire Dickie Bird. He attended Ryhill Junior, Ryhill Middle School, and then Felkirk Secondary School. After leaving school at the age of 15, he was employed as a car mechanic on wages that initially started on \u00a31-a-week.\n\nGrainger came from a footballing family and his younger brother, Jack, spent ten years at Rotherham United just after World War II. His younger sister, Lily, went on to marry Jim Iley, who played as a wing-half for Sheffield United, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest. His cousin, also named Jack Grainger, played in the Football League for Barnsley and Southport in the 1930s. Jack's younger brother, Dennis, played for Leeds United and Wrexham in the late 1940s. Another cousin, Edwin Holliday, went on to represent England whilst playing for Middlesbrough in 1959.\n\nGrainger married Doreen Rowe on 3 January 1956. They had a son, Colin Junior, born on 3 July 1956. A daughter, Kim, followed on 27 February 1964. Grainger wrote his autobiography, The Singing Winger, which was published by deCoubertin Books on 17 October 2019.\n\nClub career\n\nWrexham\nGrainger spent his youth with South Elmsall Boys, before being invited for a trial at Wrexham in July 1949. He impressed Wrexham manager Les McDowall enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of \u00a35-a-week. He spent the 1949\u201350 season playing for the reserve team in the Cheshire County League. McDowall moved on to manage Manchester City in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of Maine Road in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham. However he was called up for National Service in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the Royal Air Force. He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to \u00a38-a-week, in addition to a \u00a310 signing-on fee. He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking Billy Tunnicliffe's spot at outside-left in a Third Division North match against Hartlepools United at the Racecourse Ground, which ended in a 1\u20130 home victory. His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager Peter Jackson, and he failed to make an appearance in the 1951\u201352 season, before playing just four games of the 1952\u201353 campaign.\n\nSheffield United\nOn 27 June 1953, Grainger was signed by Second Division champions Sheffield United for a fee of \u00a32,500. United manager Reg Freeman had signed his brother Jack at Rotherham United six years previously. He was placed on the maximum wage of \u00a320-a-week and received a \u00a310 signing-on fee. Demobbed from National Service in October, he made his first-team debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Charlton Athletic at Bramall Lane on 14 November, taking the place of Derek Hawksworth at outside-left. He played with his wrist in plaster as he suffered a fracture just before his demobilisation. He featured in only two further First Division matches in the 1953\u201354 season.\n\nHe scored his first goal in the Football League in a 4\u20131 home win over Tottenham Hotspur on 30 October 1954, having got the better of right-back Alf Ramsey, with one journalist reporting that \"Ramsey never even attempted to match [Grainger] in speed\". He scored his second goal for the \"Blades\" in a 3\u20130 home win over Manchester United two weeks later, this time getting the better of right-back Bill Foulkes. United went on to secure their First Division status with a 2\u20131 victory at Blackpool on 30 April, with Grainger scoring one of the goals. Another goal on the final day of the 1954\u201355 season took his tally to six goals in 25 appearances and helped to secure a 5\u20132 win over Portsmouth to leave United 13th in the table.\n\nFreeman died of cancer in August 1955 and the team struggled at the start of the 1955\u201356 campaign. However Grainger scored both goals in a 2\u20130 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 September, providing Joe Mercer his first win as a manager. He impressed Birmingham City manager Arthur Turner sufficiently in a 2\u20130 Christmas Eve victory that Mercer was forced to rejected a transfer offer, as he told the press that \"The answer [to enquiries for Grainger] will always be the same: no!\" However United struggled in the second half of the season and were relegated with a 3\u20131 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 28 April, Grainger scoring United's goal before centre-back Howard Johnson was forced off with injury to leave United with only ten men.\n\nUnited opened the 1956\u201357 Second Division campaign away at Rotherham United, the first match where the two Grainger brothers would play on opposite teams, and it was the away side who claimed a 4\u20130 victory, with Grainger scoring two goals. As an England international playing in the second tier he found the league relatively easy, and on 1 September he secured his first career hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Barnsley after taking the bus to Oakwell as it was near the family home in Havercroft. However an injury picked up on England duty caused him to miss six weeks going into the new year and upon his recovery Mercer informed him that the club's directors had ordered him to sell Grainger for the best possible price as quickly as possible. Wolverhampton Wanderers made an offer of \u00a323,000, but could not pay the full amount immediately, and so Sheffield United instead accepted an offer of \u00a317,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at \u00a36,000) from Sunderland. Grainger was firmly against the move, but the Sheffield United board of directors were determined to bring in a large fee to pay off creditors and Mercer illegally handed him \u00a3300 as recompense.\n\nSunderland\nGrainger's arrival at Sunderland's Roker Park in February 1957 came at a difficult time as Bill Murray's 18-year reign as manager was coming to an end. The club was freely spending money, paying out \u00a322,000 for Don Revie in addition to the \u00a323,000 fee for Grainger, but were struggling near the bottom of the First Division. Sunderland spent the second half of the 1956\u201357 season in the bottom four and lost their final three matches, but avoided relegation as they ended the season one position and three points ahead of relegated Cardiff City. Sunderland were also charged by The Football Association with making illegal payments to players and chairman Bill Ditchburn was handed a lifetime ban from football whilst the club were fined \u00a35,000 and Murray resigned his post.\n\nMurray's successor as manager, Alan Brown, alienated senior players such as Billy Bingham, Don Revie and Len Shackleton, leaving Grainger to later comment that \"Brown's presence had created discordance out of harmony, anxiety out of tranquillity\" and \"football felt like work and training felt like prison\". Having been dropped to the reserves a month in the 1957\u201358 season, Grainger and goalkeeper Ray Daniel requested transfers. However he stayed on Wearside and despite beating Portsmouth on the last day of the season, Sunderland occupied the final relegation place after finishing level on points with Portsmouth but with an inferior goal average; it was the first relegation in Sunderland's history since they became founder members of the Football League in 1890 and was the last time Grainger would play in the top-flight.\n\nGrainger scored the club's first goal in the Second Division on 23 August 1958, in a 3\u20131 defeat at Lincoln City. He broke his collarbone in a 1\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town, causing him to miss five matches at a crucial time when his form was good and he was being considered again for the England squad. He totalled three goals from 37 games in the 1958\u201359 campaign, finding that he gelled well with new signing Ernie Taylor.\n\nHe played 41 of the club's 42 league matches in the 1959\u201360 season, missing only a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion on 2 January, but Sunderland laboured to a 16th-place finish. Grainger become further disillusioned and handed in a transfer request after the board of directors rejected his request of a loan in order to invest in a newsagent's shop in South Shields. He refused to play any matches for Sunderland in the 1960\u201361 season, leaving him labelled as a \"rebel footballer\" in the press, whilst Stan Anderson, Ernie Taylor, Alan O'Neill and Reg Pearce also demanded interviews with the board of directors to voice their dissatisfaction in the running of the club.\n\nLeeds United\nGrainger was sold to Leeds United for a club record fee of \u00a315,000 in July 1960, a team that had just been relegated into the Second Division, and he was given an illegal signing-on fee. Manager Jack Taylor freed him of any defensive responsibilities, with left-back Grenville Hair fit and competent enough to not need any assistance from his outside-left. However Grainger was not able to take full advantage of this tactic as his right ankle had deteriorated to the point that it needed heavy strapping and he suffered a lack of speed and confidence as a result. He did though show promising form early into his brief time at Elland Road, scoring his first goal for the club in his fourth game, a 4\u20134 draw at Bristol Rovers,  following up with his second goal five days later in a 4\u20132 win at Southampton. With the maximum wage abolished in January 1961, he signed a new contract of \u00a320-a-week. Don Revie succeeded Jack Taylor as manager in March and Grainger was in the starting eleven for Revie's first game as manager, a 3\u20131 loss at Charlton Athletic. However he was dropped after suffering a knee injury and then worsened the injury in a reserve team game against Derby County. A surgeon discovered tissue damage underneath the kneecap and removed the cartilage, leaving Grainger to recover over the summer. He was still out of action at the start of the 1961\u201362 campaign, and with the club desperate for funds and Albert Johanneson performing well in his absence, Revie made Grainger available for transfer.\n\nPort Vale\nGrainger signed with Third Division side Port Vale when manager Norman Low paid \u00a36,000 for his services in October 1961. Second Division Preston North End were also willing to pay the \u00a36,000 fee, but refused to pay a signing-on fee, whilst Port Vale offered Grainger wages of \u00a330-a-week with bonuses and a \u00a3300 signing-on fee as they wanted to match Potteries derby rivals Stoke City's ambition in re-signing Stanley Matthews. His debut was described as a 'triumphant' one as he scored in a 4\u20131 win over Torquay United at Vale Park on 21 October. On 27 January, he helped his new team to a 0\u20130 draw at former club Sunderland in the FA Cup fourth round and before the match gave his teammates placebo pills in order to boost their confidence. Four days later they completing the giant-killing with a 3\u20131 win at home and Grainger later commented that it was his best performance either playing for or against Sunderland. The club failed to replicate this form in the league however and Grainger picked up a groin injury during one of coach Eric Jones's notoriously strenuous fitness sessions. He took a cortisone injection to get him through the fifth round defeat at Fulham on 17 February and then ruled himself out of action for the rest of the 1961\u201362 season; Vale went on to end the campaign in a disappointing 12th-position.\n\nLow preferred Stan Edwards at outside-left at the start of the 1962\u201363 campaign, but Grainger was returned to the starting line-up for the third match of the season, and scored in a 2\u20130 win over Reading. A harshly cold winter known as the \"Big Freeze\" savaged the footballing season and Vale went from 22 December to 2 March without fulfilling a league fixture; however this aided Grainger as he was able to rest and heal his groin problem rather than rely on cortisone injections to mask the pain. He was however in conflict with new manager Freddie Steele, who told him the pain in his groin was just psychological. The Big Freeze's resulting fixture congestion was too much for Grainger to cope with and he again injured his groin in a 2\u20131 defeat to Barnsley on 29 March and could only feature in three of the club's final fifteen games as Vale went on to finish in third-place, four points shy of a promotion spot.\n\nHe started the opening game of the 1963\u201364 season, a 1\u20130 defeat at Shrewsbury Town, but then missed the next seven months due to his groin injury, and Ron Smith was signed as a long-term replacement on the left-wing. Grainger played two games in March and then again returned to reserve team football. He was not offered a new contract in the summer.\n\nDoncaster Rovers\nGrainger signed with Doncaster Rovers on 7 August 1964, having been signed by outgoing manager Oscar Hold on \u00a330-a-week wages and a \u00a31,000 signing-on fee. Whilst training with Barnsley over the summer, chairman Joe Richards had offered to match Doncaster's contract offer, but Grainger declined as he already had a verbal agreement with Doncaster. New player-manager Bill Leivers gave debuts to Grainger and five other new signings on the opening day of the 1964\u201365 season, a 5\u20132 defeat away at Bradford (Park Avenue). However their form soon improved and Grainger was able to manage his groin injury well enough to make 41 appearances throughout the campaign. This was despite his reputation as a former England international bringing him rough treatment from opposition defenders, so much so that he reacted to Brighton & Hove Albion winger Wally Gould's late tackles by punching Gould in the face, earning himself a red card and 21 day suspension. He then lost his first-team place at Belle Vue and featured just six times during the 1965\u201366 season, but turned down an offer from Football League chairman Alan Hardaker to represent Irish club Drumcondra in the European Cup. Grainger played an official game in the Football League for the final time on 15 October, away at Tranmere Rovers, but did start in another game seven days later that was abandoned because of fog. He was made available for transfer in December. Doncaster won the Fourth Division title, though Grainger was not eligible for a medal as he had only played five league games of the 1965\u201366 season and he was not retained in the summer.\n\nLater career\nGrainger was offered a contract by Yorkshire League club Bridlington Town, Wellington Town of the Cheshire County League, and Southern League side Poole Town. However he instead chose to sign with Cheshire County League side Macclesfield Town after agreeing a contract of \u00a317-a-week and \u00a3300 signing-on fee from manager Albert Leake. However he played just four matches at Moss Rose before asking to be released in October in order to focus on his singing career. After retiring from football in 1966, he became a sales representative and later an area manager in Yorkshire. He did however go on to serve non-league Newmillerdam as player-manager from 1969 to 1972 and went on play for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978, helping the club to win promotion from Division 2 in the 1972\u201373 campaign and featuring in both the FA Trophy and FA Vase competitions.\n\nIn 1978, Grainger accepted an offer from Billy Bingham to scout for Mansfield Town in the North East and recommended Chris Waddle to the club, though they did not act on his recommendation. He later scouted for Allan Clarke at Barnsley and Leeds United, for Mick Buxton at Huddersfield Town and for Neil Warnock at Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nInternational career\nOn 25 April 1956, Grainger was selected for a Football League representative match against the Irish League in Belfast, which ended in a 5\u20132 defeat. He earned his first England cap on 9 May 1956 in a friendly with Brazil at Wembley Stadium. He scored within the opening minutes with his first touch of the ball and in the 83rd-minute headed in England's fourth. Of his debut against Brazil, Grainger said: \"When you think of the talent in that England team, with Duncan Edwards, Billy Wright and Stanley Matthews, you delight in what might have been. We will never know how good the team could have been because Munich cheated us. But in 1956, we scored four against Brazil at Wembley and we even missed two penalties. That was how superior we were that day. Two years later, Brazil won the World Cup.\" He picked up two further caps in a tour of Scandinavia, in a 0\u20130 draw with Sweden and 5\u20132 victory in Finland. It was during this tour that his reputation as a singer became established after Nat Lofthouse asked him to sing at a bar attended by football journalists. The tour ended in a trip to Berlin to face West Germany on 26 May, the World Cup champions of 1954, a game England won 3\u20131 and that won Grainger praise from the British and German press, with England manager Walter Winterbottom effusing that \"I was extremely pleased with Colin Grainger\".\n\nGrainger was selected for the British Home Championship match in Belfast against Northern Ireland on 6 October 1956 and forced goalkeeper Harry Gregg into some excellent saves to keep the game as a 1\u20131 draw. He was again selected for The Football League XI v Irish League match on 31 October despite suffering from a toe injury, scoring in what ended as a 3\u20132 victory at St James' Park. He won a sixth England cap in a 3\u20131 victory over Wales on 14 November, but was forced to leave the game early with a twisted ankle after stretching to receive a pass from Johnny Haynes. His seventh and final cap for England came against Scotland at Wembley on 6 April 1957, the final game of the 1956\u201357 British Home Championship, which ended in a 2\u20131 victory to secure the title for England. He provided the cross for Derek Kevan to score England's first goal of the game but otherwise felt he performed poorly and was never selected again. He never fully recovered to the standard he was at before his ankle injury, and the outside-left spot at the 1958 FIFA World Cup was taken by Alan A'Court.\n\nMusical career\nGrainger signed a contract with talent agent Len Young in 1956. His first gig was as a support act to American group the Hilltoppers in Sheffield, for which he was paid \u00a350, singing three songs from the back catalogues of Al Jolson, Nat King Cole and Billy Eckstine. Due to his footballing career he was forced to turn down the offer to join the Hilltoppers on a financially lucrative tour of the US. His performance earned him a television appearance on ITV and a regular column in the Sport Express that was written by Brian Glanville. In summer 1957 he toured England and received vocal training from talent agent Joe Collins, father of actress Joan Collins. He then performed with Jack Hylton and his orchestra on ITV's After Hours show, presented by Hughie Green, and also did a television show for the BBC with Winifred Atwell, Eric Robinson and Matt Monro. He went on to be signed to the HMV label, releasing \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958.\n\nIn February 1958, he signed a contract with MCA on \u00a3250-a-week for the summer. He was offered the opportunity of touring Australia with comedian Nat Jackley in summer 1960, but turned it down as it would interfere with his pre-season training for football. On 13 June 1963, he shared a bill with the Beatles in Stockport, who received the same \u00a350 fee as Grainger after having agreed to the gig some months earlier before their recent chart success with \"Please Please Me\" and \"From Me to You\". He gave his final performance in Leeds in August 1970 when he retired from performing in order to focus on his career in sales.\n\nDuring his time as a footballer he was known as 'the singing winger' due to his vocal talent and the fact that he performed at pubs and clubs. Of his singing career, Grainger said: \"I was far more nervous before a gig than before a match. In football, you're one man of 11, but in singing, you're one man of one.\" Entertainment magazine The Stage described him as \"a very pleasing vocalist, notable for a small style and ability to sustain long notes\".\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\nSource:\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\nEngland\n British Home Championship: 1956\u201357\n\nWoolley Miners Welfare\n Yorkshire League Division 2 promotion: 1972\u201373\n\nReferences\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n \n\n1933 births\nLiving people\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nWrexham A.F.C. players\nSheffield United F.C. players\nSunderland A.F.C. players\nLeeds United F.C. players\nPort Vale F.C. players\nDoncaster Rovers F.C. players\nMacclesfield Town F.C. players\nWoolley Miners Welfare F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nEnglish Football League representative players\nEngland international footballers\nEnglish football managers\nAssociation football player-managers\nEnglish male singers\nAssociation football scouts\nMansfield Town F.C. non-playing staff\nBarnsley F.C. non-playing staff\nLeeds United F.C. non-playing staff\nHuddersfield Town A.F.C. non-playing staff\nOldham Athletic A.F.C. non-playing staff\nBury F.C. non-playing staff\nSheffield United F.C. non-playing staff\nEnglish columnists\nEnglish autobiographers", "machine_abstract": "Colin Grainger (born 16 May 1974) is the current Chief Executive Officer of Australian telecommunications company Telstra Corporation Limited, having been appointed in September 2014 following his predecessor Ronan Hughes's resignation after just over two years as CEO.\nGrainger was previously General Manager at Optus and has held senior executive positions across several other companies including AGL Energy, Origin Energy and Network Ten Television.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Colin Grainger\".

{"id": "Neil Gehrels", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil%20Gehrels", "title": "Neil Gehrels", "text": "Cornelis A. \"Neil\" Gehrels (October 3, 1952 \u2013 February 6, 2017) was an American astrophysicist specializing in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nGehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.\n\nEarly life and education \nGehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up near several telescopes including living at McDonald Observatory before his family settled in Tucson, Arizona, when he was 14, where he attended high school and then the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard J. Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at GSFC as an astrophysicist. \n\nIn 1980 while in graduate school, he married fellow graduate student Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Gehrels passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 64 on February 6, 2017.\n\nCareer \nGehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991\u20132000), Mission scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernova and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes.\n\nHe was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.\n\nResearch\n\nOverview \nGehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation.\n\nGraduate studies \nGehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976\u20131979) and Edward C. Stone (1979\u20131981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions.\n\nBalloon Observations of SN 1987A \nAs a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions.\n\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory \nGehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma-ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g. Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels, et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources.\n\nSwift and Fermi observatories \nGehrels was the Principal investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernova, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events.\n\nFor Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions.\n\nWFIRST Era \nGehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide-field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated  Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel.\n\nOther scientific work \nWorking at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest:\n 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data\n 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge\n 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas\n 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble\n 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions\n 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae\n 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky\n\nAwards and honors \n 2017, Dan David Prize, astronomy (with Shrinivas Kulkarni and Andrzesj Udalski)\n 2016, Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award\n 2016, Milner Breakthrough Prize for LIGO gravitational wave discovery (Drever, Thorne, Weiss & LIGO Team)\n 2016, Physical Sciences Award, Washington Academy of Science\n 2016, Honorary Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society\n 2015, Asteroid 16000 Neilgehrels named in his honor\n 2012, Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n 2012, Alumnus of the Year, Honors College, University of Arizona\n 2012, Harrie Massey Award of COSPAR\n 2011, Member, International Academy of Astronautics\n 2010, Member, National Academy of Sciences\n 2009, George W.

{"id": "Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostock-Lichtenhagen%20riots", "title": "Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots", "text": "From August 22 to August 24, 1992  violent xenophobic riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock, Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against migrants in postwar Germany. Stones and petrol bombs were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant right-wing extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.\n\nThe initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised. For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers. Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond, and, when they did, their responses were considered inadequate. Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for days with little or no access to basic facilities. This was contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.\n\nBetween 22 and 26 August 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former West Germany; 217 from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including 147 from Rostock; and another 37 from the former East Germany. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured. No one was killed.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Zentrale Aufnahmestelle f\u00fcr Asylbewerber f\u00fcr Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (ZAst M-V), or \"Central Refugee Shelter\" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was in an 11-storey plattenbau apartment complex known as the \"Sunflower House\" or \"Sunflower Tower\", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the asylum seekers there were living and the lack of support (if any) provided for them. The authorities had ignored  numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.\n\nRioting\nThe shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily Roma from Romania, they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.\n\nFor days prior to the riots, the newspapers Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten and Ostsee-Zeitung had been calling for a \"Lichtenhagen interest group\". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not \"cleaned up,\" order would be made. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year-old skinhead said, \"The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!\"\n\nThe first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged neo-Nazis to roam the area. This led to a situation where a xenophobic mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a ZDF television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Below, a mob of over 3,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.\n\nCharges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist police state. There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.\n\nThe first major conviction relating to the riots was on 4 March 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year-old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness. It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.\n\nThe following timeline was reconstructed by the \"Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident\" (\"Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst\").\n\nTimeline\n\nAugust 22, Day 1\nFrom about 6:00\u00a0p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02\u00a0p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46 p.m., police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02\u00a0p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24\u00a0p.m. another police unit arrived from Schwerin. At 1:34\u00a0a.m. water cannons were set up and put to continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34\u00a0a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the autobahn. At 2:25\u00a0a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30\u00a0a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued tear gas and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30\u00a0a.m.\n\nDay 1 Statistics: 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 1\n\n100 people gathered in front of the shelter. At 11:15\u00a0a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from Schwerin, Anklam, Stralsund and G\u00fcstrow. The Landespolizei force of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units (Einsatzhundertschaften) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15\u00a0p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known neo-Nazis in the area.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 2\n\nAt 6:45\u00a0p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18\u00a0p.m. the rioters started throwing Molotov cocktails. 8:00\u00a0p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30\u00a0p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00\u00a0p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30\u00a0p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41\u00a0p.m. state police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).\n\nThe state level of emergency allowed for additional federal brigades to be called in.  Hamburg sent out its SWAT (SEK and MBK) units. These riot police units of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two police dog squads from Kiel, a reserve unit from L\u00fcbeck, and helicopters from the federal police.\n\nAt 2:55\u00a0a.m. The second Hamburg unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45\u00a0a.m. the first Hamburg unit arrived. At 4:10\u00a0a.m. the situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.\n\nDay 2 Statistics: 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 1\n\n2:00\u00a0p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action), the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00\u00a0p.m. The police learned of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively if the shelter was cleared out.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 2\n\n7:45\u00a0p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55\u00a0p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.\n\nAt 8:00\u00a0p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the second Hamburg unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05\u00a0p.m. squads from the second Hamburg unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using batons. The commanding officer of the first Hamburg unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, Hafenstra\u00dfe and Flora.\n\nAt 8:15\u00a0p.m. The first Hamburg unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and police cordons were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was \"Officers in distress.\" The first Hamburg unit also provided support.\n\nAt 8:40\u00a0p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20\u00a0p.m. the retreating first Hamburg unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade MV. At 9:34\u00a0p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37\u00a0p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a police cordon and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55\u00a0p.m. the first Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began clearing out the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the second Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30\u00a0a.m. the area settled down.\n\nAt 2:00\u00a0a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00\u00a0a.m., the situation was under control.\n\nDay 3 Statistics: 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.\n\nCopycat acts\n\nIn the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis attacked 40 residences with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police.  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in Wismar, Rostock-Hinrichshagen, L\u00fcbz, and Neubrandenburg were attacked, and there were three such incidents in Greifswald. In Wismar there was a six-day riot between 15 and 20 September in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were attacks almost daily. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in G\u00fcstrow Ueckerm\u00fcnde Kr\u00f6pelin, Schwarzendorf (in the district of Malchin), Schwerin, Wismar, and Retschow were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nThe attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild. \n\nCases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped. Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated between two and three years; the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.\n\nAn investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent J\u00fcrgen Deckert for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.\n\nMedia\n Mark Saunders. \"The Truth Lies in Rostock (AVI, 698,7 MB)]\" (BRD, Great Britain, 78 min.) /  1993 von Mark Saunders & Siobhan Cleary - 121 min\n Wir Sind Jung.

She sings in Acholi, Luganda, Swahili, and English. She is known for her hit love ballad \"Amari\", the gospel hit \"Samanya\" with Levixone, and the war-themed pop hit \"Apwoyo\". Akello is an Acholi  from northern Uganda and most of her songs like \"Apwoyo\" talk about the suffering of the Acholi both during and after the Lord's Resistance Army war that left Acholis out of their homes for a long time.\n\nCareer\n\nMusic\nJackie joined a number of live performing bands before going solo. She was a member of Janzi, The Sundowners and then her own Amari Band. She worked with Levixone on their hit gospel single \"Samanya\". She also worked with other musicians such as Kaweesa, Suzan Kerunen, Myko Ouma, Tshila and Kinobe Herbert.\n\nShe worked as a backup singer for Lilian Mbabazi on songs including \"Vitamin\". Jackie took on an acting role in Maurice Kirya's \"Busaballa\" video as Proscovia.\n\nShe has performed on live stages including World Music Day 2014 and 2017 in Kampala, Blankets and Wine festival, Bayimba festival, and many other private and public events. She also toured France.\n\nJackie worked on song titled \"Black Yellow Red\", an all-star project with Cindy, Irene Ntale, Michael Ross, Viboyo, Nick Nola, and many others. She also collaborated with Mun*G and T-Bro on the song \"Ffena awamu.\" She also went international where she participated in the Singing wells projects/Abubilla Music based in the U.K in which she got to work with different artists from East Africa.\n\nThe singer entertained guests Forest Whitaker during his Ugandan visit to champion peace and development initiatives through young people.\n\nCoffee Business\nIn 2017, Jackie launched her own coffee brand Village Belle which she said she had had on her mind for a long time.\n\nConfusion with look-alike\nAkello has a striking resemblance to Kenyan and Oscar award winner Lupita Nyong'o. During shooting of the film Queen of Katwe, most people and journalists that met or saw a photo of Akello thought it was Nyong'o since everyone knew she was the country shooting the movie. The circus started when Akello's photo was published on Maurice Kirya's Facebook page to promote a music video for the song \"Busabala\" in which Jackie acted, which raised a lot of attention to the singer.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n Akello Music\n\nSongs\n Amari\n Apwoyo\n Samanya\n Wan Wilobo\n Hallelujah\n\nNominations & Awards\n\nReferences\n\nUgandan women musicians\nUgandan singer-songwriters\n21st-century Ugandan women singers\nSoul musicians\nLiving people\nUgandan jazz musicians\nJanzi Band members\n1986 births", "machine_abstract": "Jackie Akello (born September 16, 1974) is the Democratic member of Congress representing New York's 13th congressional district since January 3, 2007.

{"id": "Steve Krantz", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Krantz", "title": "Steve Krantz", "text": "Stephen Falk Krantz (May 20, 1923 \u2013 January 4, 2007) was a film producer and writer, most active from 1966 to 1996.\n\nCareer\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York City, Krantz graduated from Columbia University and went on to serve in the U.S. Army Air Forces in the Pacific during World War II as a second lieutenant.\n\nHe worked as a comedy writer for Milton Berle and Steve Allen. His later years were devoted to the production of animated cartoons in Canada. After firing Shamus Culhane from the animator's supervising director job on Rocket Robin Hood, director Ralph Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita were brought to Toronto, not knowing that Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit.\n\nFailing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas. Tony is a film and television writer, director and producer.\n\nHis sister-in-law is puppeteer and ventriloquist Shari Lewis, who is famous for performing Lamb Chop. He is of Jewish faith.\n\nDeath\nHe died in Los Angeles, California, on January 4, 2007 from complications of pneumonia, aged 83.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1923 births\n2007 deaths\nFilm producers from New York (state)\nAmerican male screenwriters\nDeaths from pneumonia in California\nColumbia College (New York) alumni\nWriters from Brooklyn\nMilitary personnel from New York City\nScreenwriters from New York (state)\nJewish American screenwriters\n20th-century American male writers\n20th-century American screenwriters\nUnited States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II\nUnited States Army Air Forces officers\n20th-century American Jews\n21st-century American Jews", "machine_abstract": "Krantz, Steve (born September 16, 1953) is the creator of the popular science fiction novels Death Race and The Hunger Games series as well as co-creator of the TV show Small Soldiers along with his brother David Krantz.\nEarly life", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Steve Krantz\".

She represented India in the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship and leads a non-profit organisation, Barefoot Skateboarders. The 2021 Netflix film, Skater Girl, is believed to be based on her life.\n\nEarly life and career\nAsha Gond was born to Dharmraj and Kamala Gond in the village of Janwar in Panna district in Madhya Pradesh to a family of farmers. Gond completed her high schooling from Manohar Kanya High School, Janwar and is an Adivasi. When Ulrike Reinhard came up with the idea and created the skatepark in the village in 2015, Gond was one of many children who began to learn and practice skateboarding. The students had no formal training and learned from YouTube videos. Due to the rules laid down by Reinhard, the children were not distracted from their studies, gave girls the first priority with the few skateboards available, and did not discriminate on the basis of caste. Gond still faced insults and threats from her fellow villagers, who believed that she should continue with the regressive traditions imposed on the women of the village.\n\nIn 2016, Reinhard helped crowdfund Gond's education in the English language at The Butler Centre for Education in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, about  from Oxford. Gond had initially dropped out of school after Class XI. She became the first child in her village to travel abroad.\n\nGond also went on to participate in many national level skateboarding competitions and was India's only female skateboarder at the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship, held in Nanjing, China. She also co-founded and runs Barefoot Skateboarders, a non-profit organisation working to improve the education and development of the children in Janwar village. She has also been featured skateboarding in a TV advertisement for tyres.\n\nFollowing the release of the trailer of Skater Girl, netizens familiar with the story of Reinhard and Gond found striking similarities between the movie and Gond's life. While Gond was interviewed as part of the production of the film, director Manjari Makijany denied that the movie was about Gond.\n\nReferences\n\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nIndian sportspeople\nLiving people", "machine_abstract": "Asha Gond is the daughter of Indian politician and former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat.\nShe was born on 16 September 1988 in Dehradun to Harish Rawat (father) and Sushma Devi (mother).", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Asha Gond\".

{"id": "West Haven station", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Haven%20station", "title": "West Haven station", "text": "West Haven station is a commuter rail station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, located in West Haven, Connecticut.  The station was built on Sawmill Road between Hood Terrace and Railroad Avenue, in the Elm Street-Wagner Place neighborhood. West Haven has 660 parking spaces in on-site lots (with the possibility of 300\u2013400 more in a parking garage in a refurbished industrial building north of the station if warranted by future demand) as well as bicycle facilities. The station is accessible. West Haven has full service on the New Haven Line, as well as from the handful of Shore Line East trains which run past New Haven to Stamford.\n\nAfter a decade of studies, planning, and controversy over the station site, ground was broken for the station on November 10, 2010.  The $80 million project included the station, with two 12-car platforms, a glass station building, and an overhead pedestrian bridge, as well as the restoration of the formerly abandoned fourth mainline track through the station. It is only the second new station on the line in a century, after  in 2011. The station opened to passengers on August 18, 2013.\n\nShore Line East service at the station was suspended indefinitely on March 16, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginal stations\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, a station stop was located in West Haven between Washington and Campbell Avenues, about  east of the modern station. The first West Haven station, at Washington Avenue, opened along with the rest of the New York and New Haven Railroad on December 25, 1848. The wood-framed building, located on the south (eastbound) side of the tracks, was moved west halfway to Campbell Avenue in 1895 when the line was quadruple-tracked. At that time, a second station was built on the westbound side across from the older station. The first station burned down on February 26, 1914, and was replaced by a new building by the middle of 1915. As trains grew longer and heavier, closely spaced village stops were retired in favor of more widely spaced downtown stations. West Haven closed in the mid-1920s, though the eastbound station building was not demolished until the 1940s. The station was briefly proposed to reopen in the 1950s following the construction of a Veterans Affairs hospital nearby; however, this did not come to fruition, and the idea was largely abandoned for several decades.\n\nA short-lived station was also located at Front Avenue in West Haven on the New Haven and Derby Railroad. The station was at street level, with stairs to the platform on the elevated tracks. The station opened in 1871 and was closed by 1914.\n\nPlanning for a new station\nIn the late 1990s, Metro-North began considering adding a station in either West Haven or neighboring Orange to fill the  gap between the  and  stations\u2014the longest such gap on the New Haven mainline. Both town governments were supportive of a station, which was then to cost $25\u201330 million. Support in West Haven was largely rallied by the West Haven Train Station Committee Inc., which circulated a petition eventually signed by 7600 residents. Support in Orange was both local by the Orange Railroad Committee and also aided by several employers, including Bayer Pharmaceuticals, whose employees were likely to use the station. In fall 2001, a site study and a regional transportation committee recommended the Orange site (at Marsh Hill Road) based on cost, time considerations, and highway access. However, in December 2001, the South Central Council of Governments voted instead to support the West Haven site, citing the economic needs of West Haven versus comparatively wealthy Orange.\n\nOrange's first selectman originally planned to appeal the decision, and controversy continued. The sustained bitter animosity between the two towns was cited in a study of bargaining between municipalities. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, issued in June 2007, considered both station sites, noting that \"The recommendation of the West Haven site does not preclude the construction of a commuter railroad station at the Orange site in the future, as the demand for additional parking and service warrants, and as additional funding becomes available.\" In 2011 - even after ground was broken at West Haven - state lawmakers considered a funding deal to build an Orange station.\n\nDesign and funding\n\nIn February 2005, the City of West Haven released a proposal for the West Haven station that modified the state's current plan, with less land taking adjacent to the station and a pedestrian bridge across Saw Mill Road to a 629-space garage in the Armonstrong North building. The city's proposal also included transit-oriented development, with a 325-unit residential development on the Armstrong South property and mixed-use buildings along Hood Terrace and Railroad Avenue. On June 19, 2006, West Haven Mayor John M. Picard and U.S. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro announced that DeLauro had secured $1.2 million in federal funding for the project, which brought the federal funding commitment as of that date to $3.2 million. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released in June 2007, estimated the capital cost for the station at $66.56 million including land acquisitions, with a total of 1,074 parking spaces split between lots and a garage. Ridership was estimated at 1,620 daily riders at opening and 1,955 by 2025, with about 20% new transit users rather than diverted from New Haven or Milford stations.\n\nDesign was one-third complete and construction planned for fall 2009 when initial renderings were released in June 2008, with costs estimated at $100 million. The State Bond Commission authorized a $103 million bond for station construction in 2009.\n\nConstruction\n\nAbout  of Track 4 - the southbound outside track - was taken out of service for passenger trains in the mid-1980s to reduce maintenance costs. The track was removed entirely between Devon and Woodmont, and reduced to freight use only between Woodmont and New Haven. The West Haven station project involved restoration of the New Haven Line's original configuration of 4 electrified main tracks in the  stretch from New Haven to Woodmont, leaving Woodmont to Devon as the only remaining triple-track section of the New Haven Line. The fourth track allows Metro-North local trains to stay exclusively on the outer tracks, leaving the inner tracks for passing Amtrak service and Metro-North expresses. The track restoration and re-electrification represented $33.68 million of the project cost. The restoration used new material, while the old rails and ties were reconditioned for use elsewhere in the state on freight-only and museum trackage.\n\nGroundbreaking was held on November 10, 2010, with the presence of outgoing Governor Jodi Rell. At the time, the station was expected to cost $118 million and open by the end of 2012. After a year of site preparation and foundation work, construction began in earnest in early 2012. In April 2012, the state announced that the station was coming in under budget, with a cost of $80 million plus $25 million in previous property acquisition and design work. The majority of station and building construction was completed by the end of 2012, with primarily electrical, interior finishing, and paving work remaining. In March 2013, as the station neared completion, some of the original station advocates began pushing to use money left over from construction to build a parking garage at the site.\n\nIn February 2013, Metro-North proposed to include West Haven in the same fare zone as New Haven Union Station and State Street station. The station was originally to open on June 1, 2013, but these plans were derailed by construction delays and the death of a track worker who was struck by a train in late May. The station ultimately opened on August 18, 2013, with a formal ribbon-cutting the next day.\n\nPlatforms and tracks\nThe station has two high-level side platforms which can accommodate 12-car trains. The northern platform, adjacent to Track 3, is generally used by westbound trains. The southern platform, adjacent to Track 4, is generally used by eastbound trains. Amtrak's Northeast Corridor services do not stop at the station and utilize all four tracks to pass through.\n\nWest Haven station is served by several bus routes of CT Transit's New Haven Division. The 265B and 265R routes stop directly at the station on Saw Mill Road, and the 265R and 271R routes stop on Main Street about  south of the station. The 265S, 271M, and 271S routes run to West Haven proper, about a  east of the station.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nStation from Google Maps Street View\n\nMetro-North Railroad stations in Connecticut\nShore Line East stations\nStations on the Northeast Corridor\nBuildings and structures in West Haven, Connecticut\nRailroad stations in New Haven County, Connecticut\nRailway stations in the United States opened in 2013\n2013 establishments in Connecticut\nTransportation in New Haven County, Connecticut", "machine_abstract": "The West Haven Railroad Station is located in the city of West Haven, Connecticut on Route 15 near downtown and was built by the New York Central Railroad (NYC) between 1890-1892 as part of its line from Bridgeport to Providence.

{"id": "Norton, Doncaster", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton%2C%20Doncaster", "title": "Norton, Doncaster", "text": "Norton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster (part of South Yorkshire, England), on the border with North Yorkshire.\n\nThe civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census.   The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary.\n\nHistory \nLittle is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.\n\nAt a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and \u2018several estates\u2019 to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.\n\nFollowing the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\u2019s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.\n\nThroughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.\n\nVillage today \nIn the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.\n\nSee also\nListed buildings in Norton and Askern\n\nReferences\n\n \nNorton\nCivil parishes in South Yorkshire", "machine_abstract": "The town of Norton is in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster within South Yorkshire England and lies on the A614 road between Rotherham to the north-east and Sheffield to the south-west.

Airing every weekday  for two hours, it features interviews, regular correspondents who specialize in various fields, and a review of developments in technology news.\n\nHistory \nCraig Crossman began as a professional entertainer and singer. He later attained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University. Additionally, Craig was a contributing editor for several tech magazines. His articles grew to a weekly column in the Miami Herald in the 1980s, one of the top ten newspapers in the USA at the time. The column was picked up by Knight Ridder (acquired by McClatchy Tribute), and the column reached a national readership once syndicated.\n\nIn 1991, Craig approached a local radio station, WJNO, about starting a tech radio program that eventually became Computer America. After a few years, the American Forum Radio Network approached him about syndicating during weekends. The national show entertained live audiences from several venues in South Florida, including The Roof Garden club and Palm Beach Atlantic University.\n\nThe show changed networks several times as a result of various mergers and acquisitions, and in 2012 the decision was made to self-syndicate.\n\nContent and Distribution\n\nDistribution \nHistorically, The Computer America Show has been more of a conventional talk radio program in which interviews and dialogue were conducted by phone and were audio-only. Switching to an internet distribution model has allowed the show to include a video component that has been used for on-air demonstrations and an overall more complete show experience. The audio is still broadcast live via terrestrial and internet radio networks, while the live video is hosted live on the show's website, and archived episodes are available through YouTube.\n\nInterviews \nThe interviews typically run for the first hour of the program, with occasional half-hour interviews during the second hour.\n\nShow Staff\n\nFounder \nCraig Crossman is The Founder of The Show and is now retired.  He still books the Show.  Prior to hosting Computer America, he worked as a professional singer in Las Vegas and later as a manager of one of the early Apple stores.\n\nHost \nBen Crossman is now the host of the Show, Craig's son.\n\nSupport Staff \n Ben Crossman is the Host of The Show!\n Aaron Crossman, Executive Producer and Webmaster; Craig's other son who helps with the development of content, the show's website, and the show in general.\n\nAmerican talk radio programs", "machine_abstract": "The Computer Museum of America (CMA) is the largest museum in North America dedicated to computers and computer-related technology, located at Route 128 Technology Park near downtown Boston Massachusetts United States.\nFounded by Paul Allen co-founder of Microsoft Corporation as The Computer History Museum it opened on September 21 1997 after being built over three years from 1994\u20131996.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Computer America\".

Dall) The height of the shell attains 3.5\u00a0mm, its diameter also 3.5\u00a0mm. The small, white, solid shell is shaped much like Littorina littorea (Linnaeus, 1758), having 4\u00bd whorls and a minute glassy rounded nucleus. The radiating sculpture consists of fine incremental striae and occasional irregularities of growth. The spiral sculpture consists of two sorts. First, the fine spiral grooving covers the whole shell evenly and is always present. Secondly, there are strong spiral ridges, generally nine or ten on the body whorl, but sometimes smaller and more numerous, sometimes partly absent, sometimes so arranged as to tabulate the part of the whorl next the suture, and almost invariably smaller and weaker as they approach the base and the centre of the base. The suture is distinct, not channelled. The simple aperture is nearly circular, but the outer margin of its thickened edge is angulated at the junction with the body. The callus is continuous. The columella is arched, with a small chink, but no umbilicus behind it. This chink varies in size with different specimens. The aperture is oblique, its upper margin a little depressed. This shell sometimes has the raised riblets reddish brown against the waxen white of the rest.\n\nDistribution\nThis species occurs in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nReferences\n\n Rubio F., Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00e9s R. & Rol\u00e1n E. 2013.

{"id": "Frank Budd", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%20Budd", "title": "Frank Budd", "text": "Francis Joseph \"Frank\" Budd (July 20, 1939 \u2013 April 29, 2014) was an American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins. Budd was an Olympic athlete who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he finished fifth in the finals of the 100 meter event and was part of the team that finished first in the 4\u00d7100 meter relay before being disqualified on a baton pass.  He set the world record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.2 seconds in 1961, breaking the record that had been set by Mel Patton in 1948.\n\nEarly life \nBudd was born in Long Branch, New Jersey.  He played high school football at Asbury Park High School in Asbury Park.\n\nHe ran track at Villanova University but never played a down of college football. At Villanova he was coached by their legendary track coach James 'Jumbo' Elliott.\n\nAmazingly. Budd achieved his success despite a deformed right calf, the legacy of a childhood disease, possibly polio.\n\nTrack career \n\nBudd was considered the world's best 100 y/m sprinter in 1961. That year, he was to equal the world record for 100 y at 9.3 s, set a new world record at 9.2 s for that distance, and was a member of a team that set a world record in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s.\n\n1960 Rome Olympics \n\nBudd had finished second behind Ray Norton in the United States Olympic trials at 100 m in a closely fought contest between the first four finishers, all recording the same time of 10.4 s. At the Olympics themselves, Budd was to finish fifth in the final with perhaps his inexperience at major championships telling against him.\n\nBudd was to experience further disappointment in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. The United States team (of Budd-Norton-Stone Johnson-Dave Sime) finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because the at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. The West German team who finished second in 39.5 s received the gold medals and became the new world record holders.\n\nWorld records \n\nIn 1961, Budd was to equal twice the then world record for 100 y of 9.3 s:\n\n on 6 May in Villanova;\n on June 11 in Villanova (Note: this time was never ratified.)\n\nThis record had stood since 1948 having first been set by Mel Patton and subsequently equaled by 12 other athletes.\n\nThen on June 24, 1961, Budd became the first man to run the 100 y in 9.2 s. He was competing in the AAU Championships at Downing Stadium in New York City.\n\nOn July 15, 1961, in a dual USA-USSR meet, Budd was a member of team that set a new world record for the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s. It is claimed that Budd, feeing a twinge in a muscle, was easing-up the last 70 m.\n\nRankings \n\nBudd was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events during the period 1960\u201362, according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.\n\nUSA Championships \nBudd achieved notable success at the AAU championships, the USA national championships.\n\nAmerican football career \n\nBudd was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 1962 NFL Draft and played for the Eagles in 1962 as a wide receiver. He played for the Washington Redskins in 1963 before switching to the Canadian Football League, where he played for the Calgary Stampeders in 1965 and 1966.\n\nBudd had both sporting and financial reasons for giving up the chance of further glory on the track for the possibility of glory and wealth on the football field; as his wife, Barbera, has stated, \"...you've got to remember that Frank loved football, too,....He didn't think it was a mistake at all. There was no money available then in track.  He'd been a terrific player at Asbury Park, and he thought, with all his speed (despite no college football experience), he'd have a long career in the NFL.\".\n\nHonors \nIn 1995, Budd was one of the seven former Villanova athletes chosen to be a member of the first induction class of the Villanova Wall of Fame.\n\nLater life \n\nBudd has been reported to have worked in later life for the New Jersey Department of Corrections and retired in 2002.\n\nA resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Budd died on April 29, 2014, in the Marlton section of Evesham Township, New Jersey. He was 74.\n\nReferences\n\n1939 births\n2014 deaths\nAmerican football wide receivers\nAmerican male sprinters\nAthletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics\nCalgary Stampeders players\nCanadian football wide receivers\nOlympic track and field athletes of the United States\nTrack and field athletes from New Jersey\nSportspeople from Long Branch, New Jersey\nPeople from Mount Laurel, New Jersey\nPhiladelphia Eagles players\nPlayers of American football from New Jersey\nWashington Redskins players\nAsbury Park High School alumni\nUSA Outdoor Track and Field Championships winners\nUSA Indoor Track and Field Championships winners\nTrack and field athletes in the National Football League\nSportspeople from Monmouth County, New Jersey", "machine_abstract": "Born in New York City, Frank Budd was the son of Italian immigrants who had settled on Long Island and worked as laborers at Ford Motor Company's plant there.

{"id": "Kinston Indians", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinston%20Indians", "title": "Kinston Indians", "text": "The Kinston Indians were a Minor League Baseball team of the Carolina League (CL) located in Kinston, North Carolina, from 1978 to 2011. They played their home games at Grainger Stadium, which opened in 1949.\n\nThe team began play in 1978 as the Kinston Eagles, borrowing their name from the city's first team of the same name dating back to 1925. They became an affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979 and rebranded as the Kinston Blue Jays in 1982. Kinston reverted to the Eagles moniker in 1986 after the Toronto affiliation ended and became the Kinston Indians upon partnering with the Cleveland Indians in 1987. After the 2011 season, the Carolina League franchise was relocated to Zebulon, North Carolina, for the 2012 campaign to become the Carolina Mudcats. \n\nThe K-Tribe won the Carolina League championship in 1988, 1991, 1995, 2004, and 2006.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\n\nKinston was represented by many amateur clubs since the late nineteenth century, but it was unable to sustain a viable professional team until the mid-1920s. Earlier attempts included an aborted campaign in the Class D Eastern Carolina League in  and an \"outlaw league\" team in  and . The latter was notable for being managed by former major league pitcher George Suggs and College Football Hall of Fame member Ira Rodgers. Due to the efforts of the city's business leaders, former local amateur star Elisha Lewis, and George Suggs, the town secured a professional team in the Virginia League for the  season named the \"Eagles\".\n\nThe Eagles were a Class B team playing out of a then newly renovated stadium designed by Suggs known as West End Park.  The squad had little success against other teams in their league, but was successful enough in gate receipts to validate the city's capacity to sustain a professional team. Kinston's team remained in the Virginia League for three years and then migrated to a newly reformed Eastern Carolina League. This later affiliation collapsed along with the stock market in . The 1920s Eagles' roster included a young catcher named Rick Ferrell, who later had a long playing career and even longer front office career in the major leagues. In , Ferrell became the only former Kinston player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Another player, Frank Armstrong, gave up baseball for a career in the armed services and became one of the most decorated generals in the history of the Air Force.\n\nCoastal Plain League\n\nThe Great Depression took a great toll on the minor leagues, with only thirteen teams operating across the U.S. at a 1933 low point. Like most, Kinston sat out the first few years of the Great Depression but reentered play for the  season in the semi-professional Coastal Plain League. By  the circuit had become a fully professional, Class D league as ranked by the National Association. The city remained in the Coastal Plain League continuously until it was disbanded after . As a member of this affiliation, Kinston saw many playoff appearances and won league championships in  and . Among the superior talent during this period was a young player named Charlie \"King Kong\" Keller who is listed as among the top forty major league players of all-time in terms of on-base percentage (.410).\n\nCarolina League\nKinston was without a team for the three-year period following the dissolution of the Coastal Plain League. In 1956, the owner of the Burlington Bees of the Carolina League moved his team to Kinston. At that time, the Carolina League was a Class B loop with teams located in Virginia and North Carolina. The team, calling itself the Kinston Eagles, were a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate and featured the city's first African American ball players. In these early days of the Civil Rights Movement, the black players in the Carolina League received much verbal and psychological abuse from the largely white, Southern fan base. The first black players were Frank Washington and Carl Long. Long excelled during the 1956 season, setting an RBI standard of 111 that has never been surpassed by any later Kinston hitter. The racial experiment succeeded, but the team failed financially. The Eagles' owner was an inept businessman who brought the club near bankruptcy before it was moved 40 miles away to Wilson in .\n\nKinston's re-entry into Carolina League baseball in  was successful both on the field and at the turnstile. The Eagles were able to claim the first of its Carolina League crowns. At a time when Kinston's population was only 25,000, the ball club attracted over 140,000 fans. Part of the lure was the talent supplied by Kinston's parent club, the Pittsburgh Pirates, which included Steve Blass (17\u20133, 1.97 ERA, 209 K's), and Frank Bork (19\u20137, 2.00 ERA). Another fan attraction was that the Eagles were for the first time a community owned team, operating under the non-profit Kinston Eagles Baseball Company, run by an elected eighteen-man, unpaid board of directors. Profits were reinvested into improving the stadium, promoting the team, and supplying playing equipment for the youth of Kinston. This arrangement continued through all thirteen years of Kinston's second tenure in the Carolina League, from  through .\n\nIn  minor league baseball was restructured nationwide, with B, C and D classes eliminated. The Carolina League became a High-A circuit. The Eagles failed to win any championships during this second era of Carolina League play, but they managed to make the playoffs in six of thirteen seasons. The Pirates stuck with Kinston through the  campaign. During three of those four seasons, the Eagles were managed by Harding \"Pete\" Peterson, who later oversaw the Pirates farm system, and become the Pirates' general manager, helping to build the late seventies team that won the World Series. The Eagles became affiliated with the new Atlanta Braves during  and , under the management of Andy Pafko. From  through  the Eagles were affiliation with the New York Yankees; the fans saw a lot of future all-stars pass through the city including a young Ron Guidry who would soon establish himself as one of the best pitchers in the American League.\n\nDuring the 1970s the popularity of minor league baseball reached its lowest point and the attendance in Kinston fell to only 30,000 for the  season. The city needed a revival of interest, and the Expos were turned to for help. The young Montreal franchise boasted a strong farm system with a lot of talent. So much talent in fact, that they decided to experiment with having two High A affiliates. Instead of dividing the players evenly between the two, all the top players were placed in the West Palm Beach club, while the newly renamed Kinston Expos had to make do with castoffs. The Kinston team soon found itself overmatched among its Carolina League rivals. The Expos fell to last place and attendance fell to only 27,000 for the year. Montreal declared the experiment a failure and withdrew from Kinston following the  season. With no major league sponsor and very little fan support, Kinston likewise withdrew from the league.\n\nFormer airline pilot Ray Kuhlman brought minor league baseball back to Kinston by investing in a Carolina League franchise in the late seventies. The renamed Kinston Eagles flew unaffiliated their first season back in the circuit in . By the next campaign, they were associated with the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto stayed with Kinston for seven years, and the team eventually took on the Blue Jay name. Kinston did not win any championships during the Blue Jays years. Kuhlman and his wife ran the team themselves and saw steady annual increases in attendance each year. The couple brought a string of marketing ideas to the team that have taken hold and remain to this day. These include increasing promotional days, fireworks displays, the introduction of Kinston baseball cards, an increase in branded souvenir merchandise, the establishment of the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame, and the hiring of a team mascot. Another fan attraction was a collection of future major league stars including Tony Fern\u00e1ndez, Fred McGriff and Cecil Fielder.\n\nFollowing the  season, the Blue Jays dropped Kinston as a franchise, and professional baseball in the city seemed to be in doubt once again. There was talk of moving the franchise to Charles County, Maryland, but the city remained in the Carolina League with an independent ball club that took on the Eagles name.  proved to be disappointing in the standings and at the gate, and talk of a move was renewed, but ownership secured an affiliation with the Cleveland Indians during the off season. For twenty-five years, Cleveland and the KTribe, as they came to be known, enjoyed a successful partnership which produced seventeen playoff appearances and five Carolina League championships (, , ,  and ). The value of the team has risen along with its onfield success. In , Kuhlman sold the team for $100,000. The franchise was sold again in  for $225,000, and changed hands again in  for $750,000. The team's value in  was estimated at $1.5 million.\n\nSix figure attendance totals became the norm throughout the 1990s and into the new century. General Manager North Johnson fostered closer bonds with the mayor's office and helped create the Mayor's Committee for Professional Baseball in . Dedicated to increasing season ticket sales and promoting ties with businesses, the committee accomplished much in a short span of time. Attendance increased by nearly twenty thousand in  and by more than twelve thousand the following year. By , the number of fans through the turnstiles topped 100,000 for the first time since . Although a new ownership group purchased the franchise in , continuity in day-to-day operations was maintained through general manager North Johnson, and front office mainstay Shari Massengill who took over the reins in . The local government's dedication to keeping baseball in Kinston is evidenced by extensive new renovations to the ballpark.\n\nThe Kinston Indians were last managed by Aaron Holbert, a former major league infielder. Their General Manager through the 2010 season, Shari Massengill, and former Assistant General Manager, Jessie Hays, made up the only all-female General Manager/Assistant General Manager team in the Minor Leagues. When Hays departed for the 2008 season, her replacement, Janell Bullock, was also female. The final GM was Benjamin Jones, who was previously employed by the Wilson Tobs.\n\nIn , the Indians won the Southern Division crown for both halves of the year, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the wild card team, the Salem Avalanche. It was the seventh season in a row that the Indians made the post season, which is a new Carolina League record formerly held by the Burlington Bees (\u2013). It was the second time a Kinston team had accomplished this feat. The Kinston Eagles of the Coastal Plain League also made it to seven post seasons in a row (\u2013). Kinston's player development contract with Cleveland ended following the 2011 season. In 2012, the franchise moved to Zebulon, North Carolina and was renamed the Carolina Mudcats.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, the Texas Rangers announced plans to bring a minor league team back to Kinston. The yet-to-be-named Class A-Advanced team will join the Carolina League starting in the 2017 season.\n\nGrainger Stadium\n\nThe Kinston Indians, and all the Kinston teams since 1949, played their home games at Grainger Stadium located at 400 East Grainger Avenue in Kinston. The original structure was built by architect John J. Rowland in 1949 at a cost of $170,000 inclusive of everything except the land. $150,000 of the money was raised by bond issue. The stadium is owned by the city and leased by the team. A dedicatory plaque identifies the structure as \"Municipal Stadium\", but it has been called Grainger Stadium since it was first built. Recent ownership referred to it as \"Historic Grainger Stadium\" due to its age relative to other fields in the Carolina League. It was the second oldest stadium in the circuit. The name Grainger comes from its location on Grainger Avenue as well as its use early on by Grainger High School. Grainger is a prominent old family name in Lenoir County.\n\nAnnual Awards\nEach year, usually on the weekend of the last home games, the Kinston Indians presented awards to those deserving. The team MVP Award was named in honor of \"Cap'n Pat\" Crawford. Crawford was a longtime Kinston resident who made it to the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals during the Gashouse Gang era.\n\nSteve Olin was a right-handed submarining relief pitcher for Kinston who had moved up to the Cleveland Indians. He was killed in a boating accident during spring training of 1993 in Winter Haven, Florida. The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever Tim Crews and seriously injuring Bob Ojeda. Kinston's annual award for Pitcher of the Year was named in his honor.\n\nThe award given each year to the player who had to overcome the greatest adversity in his career was named in honor of Tex Drake. Drake was one of the batboys for the Kinston Blue Jays starting with the  season. On the last day of the  campaign, he found out that he had Hodgkin's Disease which had advanced to all four stages. The club president, Gary Fitzpatrick, arranged for Drake to work as a batboy for the last three home games of the Toronto Blue Jays season. Once back in Kinston, Drake was able to overcome his cancer through chemotherapy and return to his duties on the field.\n\nThe Kinston player who best represented good sportsmanship was given an award named for Steve Gaydek. Gaydek was a former member of the club's Board of Directors who became a lifelong fan of Kinston's baseball teams. He attended every home game for over twenty years even though he lived over thirty miles from the ballpark.\n\nLewis B. \"Mac\" McAvery was the head groundskeeper from  to his death in . In honor of his accomplishments, the team established an award in his name to be given to the individual who has did the most to \"preserve and enhance\" professional baseball in Kinston.\n\nMascots\n\nThe Indians' last mascot was a dog named Scout. Scout was usually found in an Indians jersey and baseball cap, but was also known to don a Superman t-shirt or an aloha shirt depending on the antics he was performing. Scout replaced an earlier Native American mascot who was named Tom E. Hawk. After the introduction of Scout, Tom E. Hawk no longer greeted fans in person at the ballpark, but he was still seen in several of the official logos on much of the team merchandise through the 2010 season. His broadly smiling visage is very reminiscent of Cleveland's Chief Wahoo. In late 2010, the team released new logos which did not include Tom E. Hawk.\n\nDuring the days when Kinston was a Toronto Blue Jays affiliate, the team had a bird mascot named B.J.  manager Dennis Holmberg once resorted to dressing up in the mascot's costume so that he could return to the dugout undetected after being ejected from a game. For the  season, the Blue Jays had a dozen teenage girls, known as the Golden Corral Lady Jays, in the stadium. This experiment only lasted the one season.\n\nLocal baseball personalities\n\nChris Hemeyer: Hemeyer was the radio voice of the Indians as well as the host of Tribe Talk. Tribe Talk was an interview television program shown on local public access stations in southeastern North Carolina. Besides interviewing team members and staff, the show also has highlighted recent Kinston games. First run episodes aired once a week during the season.\nTeam Mamas: Anne \"Mama\" Robinson and Evelyn \"Mama\" Kornegay were local residents of Kinston who hosted players during their stay in Kinston. Mama Robinson hosted players for the first eleven years of the current franchise (1987\u20131997), while Mama Kornegay took over the duties until her death in 2010. Although only a few of the team members lived in the house at any one time, the homes became popular gathering places and a home away from home for the club. Prior to this arrangement, players had some difficulty establishing a stable environment in which to live. In his autobiography, Ron Guidry relates how his rented mobile home was sold out from under him while he was gone on Reserve duty. David Wells tells similar stories of being bounced around from place to place during his time in Kinston.\nDelmont Miller: (March 30, 1966 \u2013 October 25, 2008): Miller was the longtime scoreboard operator for the Indians. His humorous first inning chatter and \"shout-outs\" prior to each \"KTribe\" game had become a tradition at Grainger Stadium. Recognizing the popularity of Delmont with both the fans and the players, the Kinston front office held special \"Delmont Miller Nights\" and built promotions around his unique personality. His twenty-plus year career at the stadium spanned several ownerships and even major league affiliation changes. Prior to becoming the scoreboard operator, he was the clubhouse assistant for the Kinston Blue Jays. His first name came from his father's love of Del Monte brand peaches. On October 25, 2008, the 42-year-old Miller died of a massive heart attack.\nThe Smeraldos: Robert Smeraldo and Robert Smeraldo Jr. were the longtime father/son clubhouse managers for the ballclub. The senior Smeraldo has since died. His son no longer works for the team.\n\nSeason-by-season results \n\nTABLE NOTES:\n DNF = Did Not Finish season.\n Sources\n\nPlayoffs\n1981 season: Lost to Peninsula 1\u20130 in semifinals.\n1985 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2\u20130 in semifinals.\n1987 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2\u20130 in semifinals; lost to Salem 3\u20131 in championship.\n1988 season: Defeated Lynchburg 3\u20132 to win championship.\n1990 season: Lost to Frederick 3\u20132 in championship.\n1991 season: Defeated Lynchburg 3\u20130 to win championship.\n1993 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2\u20131 in semifinals.\n1995 season: Defeated Wilmington 3\u20130 to win championship.\n1996 season: Defeated Durham 2\u20131 in semifinals; lost to Wilmington 3\u20131 in championship.\n1997 season: Lost to Lynchburg 3\u20131 in championship.\n1999 season: Lost to Myrtle Beach 2\u20131 in semifinals.\n2001 season: Lost to Salem 2\u20131 in semifinals.\n2002 season: Defeated Myrtle Beach 2\u20130 in semifinals; lost to Lynchburg 3\u20131 in championship.\n2003 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2\u20130 in semifinals.\n2004 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2\u20131 in semifinals; defeated Wilmington 3\u20132 to win championship.\n2005 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2\u20130 in semifinals; lost to Frederick 3\u20132 in championship.\n2006 season: Defeated Salem 2\u20130 in semifinals; defeated Frederick 3\u20130 to win league championship.\n2007 season: Lost to Salem 2\u20131 in semifinals.\n2010 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 3\u20130 in semifinals.\n2011 season: Defeated Myrtle Beach 3\u20131 in semifinals; lost to Frederick 3\u20131 in championship.\n\nNo Hitters\n\nOscar Mu\u00f1oz (5/26/1991) vs the Prince William Cannons\nPaul Byrd, Scott Morgan, and Mike Soper (8/23/1991) vs the Prince William Cannons\nJason Rakers (6/4/1997) vs the Durham Bulls (7 inning game)\nKeith Ramsey (9/6/2004) vs the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (perfect game)\nMarty Popham, Chris Jones and Cory Burns (9/5/2010) vs the Potomac Nationals (10 innings)\n\nSee also \nKinston Eagles \u2013 Previous baseball teams in Kinston known as the Eagles\n\nBibliography\n\nAutobiographies and biographies\n\nLeague histories\n\nNewspapers \n  \u2013 Issues for the 1908 season do not exist.

The frequency was then awarded to XEHIT-AM to migrate as XHHIT-FM, which signed on in November 2018.\n\nUntil 2018, XEZT carried the La Mejor grupera format from MVS Radio. The station left the network in September 2018 but returned to grupera under the \"La Magn\u00edfica\" name in October 2019.\n\nIt later emerged that an error by the IFT led to Tribuna Comunicaci\u00f3n underpaying the required fee to migrate, an error also made with respect to the migration of XEEG-AM 1280. Tribuna sued the IFT in court and successfully won an order to have 95.5 made available for its use. In 2020, XHHIT-FM was moved to 105.5 MHz in compliance with the court order; on November 24, 2021, La Magn\u00edfica then launched on FM.\n\nReferences\n\nMass media in Puebla (city)", "machine_abstract": "XHZT-FM (XEJHZ-FM) is the radio station of XEZ-TV in Santa Clara, California and broadcasts on 1020 AM frequency from San Jose to Los Angeles.\nThe station was founded by former KSBJ-AM owner John Hertz as XEJHZ-FM in 1988 after he bought out his partner's interest in that station; it changed its call sign to XEZ-HD2 when it moved into HD Radio technology in 2005.

{"id": "Snyder, New York", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder%2C%20New%20York", "title": "Snyder, New York", "text": "Snyder (originally Snyderville) is a hamlet within the town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, United States that is part of the Buffalo \u2013 Niagara Falls metropolitan area.  The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo and points to the east in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nAs of 2009, the hamlet had several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions.  The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college.  The Snyder community has above-average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region.  The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet.\n\nThe traditional definition of the hamlet is the \"Snyder\" postal service area, now merged into the 14226 zip code.  However, using United States Census Bureau-based data, which does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the modern definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snyderville  and subsequently Snyder.  Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County.  As newlyweds, they moved to a log cabin on a farm on the 4301 Main Street location of Amherst Central High School.  The Schenck family moved to Amherst at the corner of Main Street and Harlem Road in 1821. Abraham Snyder arrived from Pennsylvania in 1823 and moved to a spacious frame house in the late 1830s. His son Michael rose to prominence. John Schenck, Michael Snyder's cousin, built the hamlet's first house and later built the first store in 1837, which was the year the hamlet was first established.\n\nIn 1830, a stagecoach was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and Batavia, and sometimes Albany, and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street. By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory. Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the stagecoach line along Main Street.  In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the Amherst Bee, which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper. L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883.\n\nIn 1892, an electric trolley, which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 62, into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's streetcar system.  This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the \"country\".  This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs. In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street/Harlem Road area, including blacksmith shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain. In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live closer to each other in new subdivisions.\n\nGeography\n\nSnyder is located in the southern part of Amherst, which is located in Erie County.  As a hamlet it has no formal boundaries, but was originally defined by the area served by its post office.  The traditional boundaries of the hamlet are Getzville and\nBrantwood Road on the west, Sheridan Drive, also known as New York State Route 324, on the north, I-290, known as the Youngmann Expressway/I-90, known as New York State Thruway on the east, and the Cheektowaga town line along Wehrle Drive east of Harlem Road and then Winspear Avenue on the south.\n\nWhen defining the Snyder community market area using census data, the western boundary extends a little further to include parts of the hamlet of Eggertsville, which was built around the Main Street and Eggert Road intersection, with a western boundary from north to south of Millersport Highway, also known as New York State Route 263, Longmeadow Road, Westfield Road, Main Street, LeBrun Road, and Eggert Road.  When defined this way, Snyder includes (using a Main Street and Harlem Road origin, starting with the northwest quadrant, and moving clockwise) census block groups 1\u20133 from census tract 94.01; census block groups 3 & 4 from census tract 94.02; census block groups 3\u20135 from census tract 95.02; and census block groups 1, 3\u20135 from census tract 95.01.  The center of town at Main Street and Harlem is at an elevation of .\n\nThe business district is located between Burroughs Drive to the east and Campus Drive to the west on Main Street.  In this region, the Snyder Fire Department, the Eggertsville-Snyder Branch of the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library (4622 Main Street), the Amherst YMCA (4433 Main Street), and the Main Harlem Plaza as well as the former location of the United States Postal Service office for the 14226 zip code that includes Snyder and the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville are located.  The post office for the zip code was formerly located at Main Street and Chateau Terrace with a 25 Chateau Terrace address until May 1, 1990.\n\nHarlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts.  Sheridan Harlem Plaza and adjacent commercial property are located at the north end of Harlem. Both Kensington Avenue and Wehrle Drive intersect the southern part of the Snyder portion of Harlem in a commercial region that extends into Cheektowaga.  The Harlem\u2013Kensington commercial district is historic.  The fourth commercial district is located in the eastern edge of the hamlet at the intersection of Main Street and Kensington Avenue near the entrance to the Youngmann Expressway. The extended Snyder community has additional commercial areas along the highly commercial Sheridan Drive and on Millersport Highway.\n\nTransportation\nSnyder is bounded by I-290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this interstate highway that are both less than a  from the Main and Harlem center of town.  This provides direct access to the I-90 (The New York State Thruway) and continuing south on Harlem to the New York State Route 33 a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I-90.  The community is also serviced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which provides three different bus routes (30, 48, and 49) connecting directly to the light rail Buffalo Metro Rail along Main Street to the west.  All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to Erie Community College (north campus), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Transit Road (New York State Route 78).  The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations.\n\nHistorically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street.  In 1836, the street became a Macadam toll road.  On  April 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsville  to the east.  It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings: Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive and Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard.  The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918.  Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005.  These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area.\n\nWillard Genrich built the Lord Amherst Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I-290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses.\n\nEconomy\n\nSnyder is an affluent and well-educated community in Metropolitan Buffalo.  The residential population consists mostly of large single family homes on individual lots.  The 2000 United States Census average household income of $87,700 ($ today) far exceeds the Buffalo regional average of $57,400 ($).  The Snyder population declined from 14,294 to 13,875 while the number of households increased from 5,469 to 5,574 between the 1990 United States Census and the 2000 United States Census.  During the decade the number of children age 5\u201317 and adults age 35\u201354 grew significantly while the young adults age 18\u201334 and adults over the age of 55 declined sharply.  The number of housing units grew from 5,662 to 5,739. 1990 housing was 82.5% single-family housing.  The busiest ATM in the entire Buffalo region is in Snyder.\n\nThe traditionally defined Snyder portion of Main Street had 180 businesses as of January 2002. The town has two theatres: MusicalFare Theatre, a not for profit corporation on the Daemen College campus, and ComedySportz Buffalo.\n\nStarting in the 1950s zoning laws required that all new buildings be set back from the street and have private on-site parking.  The 21st Century zoning laws date back to 1976.\n\nGovernment\nThere is no formal Snyder government.  The hamlet, like the rest of the town of Amherst, is served by the Town of Amherst Government and receives municipal services from the town.  It is serviced by entities such as the Amherst Police Department, Snyder fire department and the Town of Amherst Highway Department, although Main Street and Harlem Road are serviced by the New York State Department of Transportation.  Residents of Amherst, including those in Snyder, pay taxes both to the Town of Amherst and the County of Erie.  However, the town tax is solely a school tax and the county collects the remaining town taxes for municipal services.\n\nEducation\n\nAmherst Central High School, the town's public high school, is located at 4301 Main Street, just west of the business district.  The school started when the new Amherst school district was created in the late 1920s.  Previously students from Eggertsville and Snyder either attended Bennett High School at 2885 Main Street in Buffalo or what is now called Williamsville South High School at 5950 Main Street in Williamsville and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Williamsville Junior and Senior High School.\n\nDaemen College is located across from the high school at 4380 Main Street.  Amherst Middle School (formerly Amherst Junior High School), the town's public middle school, is located two blocks south of the High School at 55 Kings Highway.  Additionally, the Stenograhic Institute-Western New York at 4525 Main Street, which offers undergraduate degrees, is found in the business district.\n\nOther schools located in the district include Smallwood Drive Elementary School (K-5), Park School of Buffalo (Pre-K-12), and Christ The King School (Pre-K-8). Park has been located in Snyder since 1922.  Smallwood is public; Park is private and Christ The King is a Roman Catholic school.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSnyder Homepage\nAmherst homepage\nEggertsville-Snyder branch of the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library\n\n1837 establishments in New York (state)\nPopulated places established in 1837\nBuffalo\u2013Niagara Falls metropolitan area\nHamlets in New York (state)\nHamlets in Erie County, New York", "machine_abstract": "Snyder is a hamlet in the town of Coram, located on Long Island's North Shore near Holbrook and Coram Boroughs.

{"id": "Bob Arbogast", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Arbogast", "title": "Bob Arbogast", "text": "Robert \"Bob\" Arbogast (April 1, 1927 \u2013 March 21, 2009) was an American radio broadcaster, voice actor, and television host.\n\nEarly life and education\nBob was born in Bellingham, Washington, the only child of Lewis, a champion tennis player, stockbroker, World War One veteran under an assumed name, and World War Two Coast Guard volunteer and Christine Arbogast, a champion tennis player.  Bob attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles where he was on the league-champion tennis team and was graduated in 1944.  Upon graduation, he enlisted in the navy. His unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Bronze Star for bravery for a multi-ship raid into Tokyo Bay.  He was demoted from Signalman 3rd class to Seaman 1st class when his commanding officer told him to hop to it and Bob proceeded to jump up and down on the deck of the USS Brush. At the train station in Atwater Village (Glendale), upon his return from the South Pacific theater, he saw the coffins of many of his classmates from Marshall High who had died, and did not live to see a world without war. When the war ended, he attended Los Angeles City College and then the University of Arizona on the GI bill. A radio program director from WHB in Kansas City heard Arbogast's nighttime show on the university's radio station and hired him immediately.\n\nCareer\nBob went to Chicago's WMAQ where he worked with Pete Robinson from 1951 to 1953 (using as a theme song a charming version of Sicilian Tarantella played on an ocarina) before moving to Los Angeles for a time, then returning to Illinois where he worked at WEAW in Evanston, Illinois. Then he went to New York where he wrote for two shows, one featuring Tom Poston and another Peter Marshall. Then he worked at San Francisco's KSFO and KFRC. He later worked at many stations in Los Angeles including KMPC from 1962 to 1967, KLAC in 1967, KFI in 1968, and KGBS in 1969.\n\nAt KMPC, he wrote for Dick Whittinghill and Gary Owens, and he wrote with and was the partner of Jack Margolis at KLAC and KGBS.  Their radio talk show at KLAC had the highest rating of any radio program in LA history up until that time (and perhaps still), with a 14.5 percent share of the audience.  Due to a concentrated letter-writing campaign, they were fired for their objection to the Vietnam war and their pro-choice stance.  They may have been among the last fired due to the McCarthy dealings of the 1950s.  The pair also hosted a TV show on KTTV for a while.\n\nArbogast created the Question Man in Kansas City in 1951 and used it on the Poston Show in NY. It was later a feature on The Steve Allen Show, to the surprise of Bob and Steve - as Allen acknowledged in his book, The Question Man.  The concept lived on in Johnny Carson's Carnac the Magnificent and Jeopardy!.\n\nIn 1958, Arbogast teamed with Stanley Ralph Ross to write and perform the hit 45 rpm single \"Chaos, Parts 1 and 2,\" which when it came out (on Liberty Records #55197), sold 10,000 copies in three days, and then was banned from radio play on the fourth day - when stations realized that it satirized \"Top 40\" radio.  Dr. Demento has kept \"Chaos\" alive. In addition, they co-wrote the album of parody songs titled My Son, the Copycat (a take on Allan Sherman's albums) and the book Speak When You Hear the Beep.\n \nArbogast had numerous screen credits for cartoons and commercials and had appeared on television shows and in movies. He did frequent uncredited voiceovers for Sesame Street segments. He was the voice for the original \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\" advertising campaign and of the animated Granny Goose for the Granny Goose potato chip campaign (What is Granny's secret?  I won't say...\") Among hundreds, Arbogast is perhaps most famous for his voicings of General G.I. Brassbottom, Noodles Romanoff, and Ma Ramjet in the Roger Ramjet cartoon, Jack Wheeler in the Hot Wheels cartoon, and Snogs on the Hanna-Barbera animated series Monchhichis. He also voiced several characters in the Hanna-Barbera series The Jetsons. Not to be forgotten were Arbo's stylings of Barry Bear and Drummy Drummer, popular seventies pull-string toys - \"I'm Barry Bear, like to meet my paw?\"  \"I'm Drummy Drummer.  I went to school at the school of hard knocks.\" - and his renditions of hamburgers in early McDonald's commercials. While in elementary school at Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles, his son John was scolded when asked by his teacher, Mrs. Horowitz, what his father does for a living. John replied, \"he is a bear.\" Refusing to recant, a meeting with the teacher, principal, and Bob resulted in free hot dogs on \"Hot Dog Wednesday\" for John for a year. John also has many voices still running on Sesame Street.  In 1966 he appeared in the campy horror film \"Batwoman\".\n\nOne of his most popular bits was his portrayal of little old lady Emily Norton for KMPC.\n\nAmong his many TV and radio commercial partners were Pat Harrington, Harry Morgan, Doris Roberts, Joan Gerber, Edie McClurg, Bob Elliott, Albert Brooks, Shelley Berman, Tim Conway, Lorenzo Music, Gene Moss and Casey Kasem.\n\nArbogast won an Emmy as a writer for Stars of Jazz in 1958 and a Clio in the '70's, for the Highland Appliance Co. of Detroit. He wrote for Sesame Street and The Pat Paulsen Show. He also has the dubious distinction of writing for the shortest-lived television show ever, Turn-On, which was canceled after one night because it satirized, among others, the Pope. He co-starred (had two lines and 6 minutes on camera) with Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in the motion picture The Falcon and the Snowman and he drove the bus in Linda Lovelace for President.\n\nArbogast was a jazz aficionado, Chicago Cubs and UCLA Bruins fan, and animal lover.  He and his wife, Jan, lived in Mariposa, California, tending to their garden, caring for their pets, and the pleasures of the internet, satellite radio and television.  With his previous wife, Joanna, he raised a daughter and three sons. His oldest son Peter is the radio voice of USC Trojan football. His middle son John is a USC honors grad, a decorated Coast Guard officer, retired Los Angeles city park ranger, history teacher, city champion pole vault coach and assistant track and field coach at John Marshall High School. His youngest son Jerry is a UCLA graduate and a retired physical education teacher and tennis coach in the Los Angeles Unified School District. His daughter Paula retired in June 2006 from her position as a teachers' union representative.

{"id": "Huo Qubing", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huo%20Qubing", "title": "Huo Qubing", "text": "Huo Qubing (140 BC \u2013 117 BC) was a Chinese military general and politician of the Western Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. He was the nephew of the general Wei Qing and Empress Wei Zifu (Emperor Wu's wife), and the half-brother of the statesman Huo Guang. Along with Wei Qing, he led a campaign into the Gobi Desert of what is now Mongolia to defeat the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, winning decisive victories such as the Battle of Mobei in 119 BC.\n\nEarly life\nHuo Qubing was an illegitimate son from the love affair between Wei Shaoer (), the daughter of a lowly maid from the household of Princess Pingyang (Emperor Wu's older sister), and Huo Zhongru (), a low-ranking civil servant employed there at the time.  However, Huo Zhongru did not want to marry a lower class serf girl like Wei Shaoer, so he abandoned her and went away to marry a woman from his home town instead.  Wei Shaoer insisted on keeping the child, raising him with help of her siblings.\n\nWhen Huo Qubing was around two years old, his younger aunt Wei Zifu, who was serving as an in-house singer/dancer for Princess Pingyang, caught the attention of the young Emperor Wu, who took her and her half-brother Wei Qing back to his palace in the capital, Chang'an.  More than a year later, the newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with Emperor Wu's first child, earning her the jealousy and hatred of Emperor Wu's then empress consort, Empress Chen.  Empress Chen's mother, Grand Princess Guantao (), then attempted to retaliate against Wei Zifu by kidnapping and attempting to murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman at the Jianzhang Camp (\u5efa\u7ae0\u71df, Emperor Wu's royal guards).  After Wei Qing was rescued by fellow palace guards led by his close friend Gongsun Ao (), Emperor Wu took the opportunity to humiliate Empress Chen and Princess Guantao by promoting Wei Zifu to a consort (\u592b\u4eba, a concubine position lower only to the Empress) and Wei Qing to the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (), Chief of Staff (), and Chief Councillor (), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants.  The rest of the Wei family were also well rewarded, including the decreed marriage of Wei Shaoer's older sister Wei Junru () to Emperor Wu's adviser, Gongsun He ().  At the time, Wei Shaoer was romantically engaged with Chen Zhang (), a great-grandson of Emperor Gaozu's adviser Chen Ping.  Their relationship was also legitimized by Emperor Wu through the form of decreed marriage. Through the rise of the Wei family, the young Huo Qubing grew up in prosperity and prestige.\n\nMilitary career\nHuo Qubing exhibited outstanding military talent even as a teenager.  Emperor Wu saw Huo's potential and made Huo his personal assistant.\n\nIn 123 BC, Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing from Dingxiang () to engage the invading Xiongnu, and appointed the 18-year-old Huo Qubing to serve as the Captain of Piaoyao () under his uncle, seeing real combat for the first time.  Although Wei Qing was able to kill or capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian (\u8607\u5efa, father of the Han diplomat and statesman, Su Wu) and Zhao Xin (\u8d99\u4fe1, a surrendered Xiongnu prince) was outnumbered and annihilated after encountering the Xiongnu force led by Yizhixie Chanyu ().  Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting.  Due to the loss of this detachment, Wei Qing's troops did not earn any promotion, but Huo Qubing distinguished himself by leading a long-distance search-and-destroy mission with 800 light cavalrymen, killing the Chanyu's grandfather and over 2,000 enemy troops, as well as capturing numerous Xiongnu nobles.  A very impressed Emperor Wu then made Huo Qubing the Marquess of Champion () with a march of 2,500 households.\n\nIn 121 BC, Emperor Wu deployed Huo Qubing twice in that year against the Xiongnu in the Hexi Corridor.  During spring, Huo Qubing led 10,000 cavalry, fought through five Western Regions kingdoms within 6 days, advanced over 1,000 li over Mount Yanzhi (), killed two Xiongnu princes along with nearly 9,000 enemy troops, and captured several Xiongnu nobles as well as the golden statue used by Xiongnu as an artifact for holy rituals. For this achievement, his march was increased by 2,200 households. During the summer of the same year, Xiongnu attacked the Dai Commandery and Yanmen.  Huo Qubing set off from Longxi (modern-day Gansu) with over 10,000 cavalry, supported by Gongsun Ao, who set off from the Beidi Commandery (\u5317\u5730\u90e1, modern-day Huan County, Gansu).  Despite Gongsun Ao failing to keep up, Huo Qubing travelled over 2,000 li without backup, all the way past Juyan Lake to Qilian Mountains, killing over 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers and capturing a dozen Xiongnu princes.  His march was then increased further by a 5,400 households for the victory.\n\nHuo Qubing's victories dealt heavy blows to the tribes of the Xiongnu princes of Hunxie () and Xiutu () that occupied the Hexi Corridor.  Out of frustration, Yizhixie Chanyu wanted to mercilessly execute those two princes as punishment. The Prince of Hunxie contacted the Han government in autumn of 121 BC to negotiate a surrender. Failing to persuade his fellow prince to do the same, he killed the Prince of Xiutu and ordered Xiutu's forces to also surrender.  When the two tribes went to meet the Han forces, Xiutu's forces rioted.  Seeing the situation changed, Huo Qubing alone headed to the Xiongnu camp. There, the general ordered the Prince of Hunxie to calm his men and stand down before putting down 8,000 Xiongnu men who refused to disarm, effectively quelling the riot.  The Hunxie tribe was then resettled into the Central Plain.  The surrender of the Xiutu and Hunxie tribes stripped Xiongnu of any control over the Western Regions, depriving them of a large grazing area.  As a result, Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct trade access to Central Asia.  This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army.  Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor. He colonised the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier-settlers.\n\nAfter the series of defeats by Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Yizhixie Chanyu took Zhao Xin's advice and retreated with his tribes to the north of the Gobi Desert, hoping that the barren land would serve as a natural barrier against Han offensives.  Emperor Wu however, was far from giving up, and planned a massive expeditionary campaign in 119 BC.  Han forces were deployed in two separate columns, each consisting of 50,000 cavalry and over 100,000 infantry, with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing serving as the supreme commander for each.\n\nEmperor Wu, who had been distancing Wei Qing and giving the younger Huo Qubing more attention and favour, hoped that Huo would engage the stronger Chanyu's tribe and preferentially assigned him the most elite troopers.  The initial plan called for Huo Qubing to attack from Dingxiang (\u5b9a\u8944, modern-day Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia) and engage the Chanyu, with Wei Qing supporting him in the east from Dai Commandery (\u4ee3\u90e1, modern-day, Yu County, Hebei) to engage the Left Worthy Prince ().  However, a Xiongnu prisoner of war confessed that the Chanyu's main force was at the east side.  Unaware that this was actually false information provided by the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu ordered the two columns to switch routes, with Wei Qing now setting off on the western side from Dingxiang, and Huo Qubing marching on the eastern side from the Dai Commandery.\n\nBattles at the eastern Dai Commandery theatre were quite straightforward, as Huo Qubing's forces were far superior to their enemies.  Huo Qubing advanced over 2,000 li and directly engaged the Left Worthy Prince in a swift and decisive battle.  He quickly encircled and overran the Xiongnu, killing over 70,000 men, and capturing three lords and 83 nobles, while suffering a 20% casualty rate that was quickly resupplied from local captives.  He then went on to conduct a series of rituals upon his arrival at the Khentii Mountains (\u72fc\u5c45\u80e5\u5c71, and the more northern \u59d1\u884d\u5c71) to symbolize the historic Han victory, then continued his pursuit as far as Lake Baikal (), effectively annihilating the Xiongnu clan and allowing conquering tribe such as the Donghu People to retake back their land to establish their own confederacy to declared independent from Xiongnu Overlord following the subjugation for over a few decade.  A separate division led by Lu Bode (), set off on a strategically flanking route from Right Beiping (\u53f3\u5317\u5e73, modern-day Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia), joined forces with Huo Qubing after arriving in time with 2,800 enemy kills, and the combined forces then returned in triumph.  This victory earned Huo Qubing 5,800 households of fiefdom as a reward, making him more distinguished than his uncle Wei Qing. At the height of his career, many low-ranking commanders previously served under Wei Qing voluntarily transferred to Huo Qubing's service in the hope of achieving military glory with him.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nEmperor Wu offered to help Huo Qubing build up a household for marriage. Huo Qubing, however, answered that \"the Xiongnu are not yet eliminated, why should I start a family?\" (\u5308\u5974\u672a\u6ec5\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5bb6\u70ba\uff1f), a statement that became an inspirational Chinese patriotic motto.  Though Huo Qubing was recorded as a quietly spoken man of few words, he was far from humble. Sima Qian noted in Shiji that Huo Qubing paid little regard to his men, refusing to share his food with his soldiers, and regularly ordering his troops to conduct cuju games despite them being short on rations. When Emperor Wu suggested him to study The Art of War by Sun Tzu and Wuzi by Wu Qi, Huo Qubing claimed that he naturally understood war strategies and had no need to study. When his subordinate Li Gan (\u674e\u6562, son of Li Guang) assaulted Wei Qing, the latter forgave the incident. Huo Qubing, on the other hand, refused to tolerate such disrespect towards his uncle and personally shot Li Gan during a hunting trip. Emperor Wu covered for Qubing, stating that Li Gan was \"killed by a deer\".\n\nWhen it came to military glory, Huo Qubing was said to be more generous.  One story about him told of when Emperor Wu awarded Huo a jar of precious wine for his achievement, he poured it into a creek so all his men drinking the water could share a taste of it, giving the name to the city of Jiuquan (\u9152\u6cc9, literally \"wine spring\").\n\nHuo Qubing died in 117 BC at the early age of 23. After Huo Qubing's death, the aggrieved Emperor Wu ordered the elite troops from the five border commanderies to line up all the way from Chang'an to Maoling, where Huo Qubing's tomb was constructed in the shape of the Qilian Mountains to commemorate his military achievements. Huo Qubing was then posthumously appointed the title Marquess of Jinghuan (), and a large \"Horse Stomping Xiongnu\" () stone statue was built in front of his tomb, near Emperor Wu's tomb of Maoling.\n\nHuo Qubing was among the most decorated military commanders in Chinese history.  The Eastern Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu, summarized in his Book of Han Huo Qubing's achievements with a poem:\nThe Champion of Piaoji, fast and brave.Six long-distance assaults, like lightning and thunder.Watering horse at Lake Baikal, conducting rituals at Khentii Mountains.Conquering the area west of great river, establishing commanderies along Qilian Mountains.\n\u7968\u9a0e\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u730b\u52c7\u7d1b\u7d1c\uff0c\u9577\u9a45\u516d\u64e7\uff0c\u96fb\u64ca\u96f7\u9707\uff0c\u98f2\u99ac\u7ff0\u6d77\uff0c\u5c01\u72fc\u5c45\u5c71\uff0c\u897f\u898f\u5927\u6cb3\uff0c\u5217\u90e1\u7941\u9023\u3002\n\nHuo Qubing's half-brother, Huo Guang, whom he took custody away from his father, was later a great statesman who was the chief counsel for Emperor Zhao, and was instrumental in the succession of Emperor Xuan to the throne after Emperor Zhao's death.\n\nHuo Qubing's son, Huo Sh\u00e0n (), succeeded him as the Marquess of Jinghuan but died young in 110 BC.  So Huo Qubing's title became extinct.  His grandson Huo Sh\u0101n (\u970d\u5c71, later Marquess of Leping) and Huo Yun (\u970d\u4e91, later Marquess of Guanyang) were involved in a failed plot to overthrow Emperor Xuan of Han in 66 BC, resulting in both of them committing suicide and the Huo clan being executed. It was presumably that no male descendant of Huo Qubing nor Huo Guang survived, as during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, it was Huo Yang, a great-grandson of Huo Qubing's paternal cousin, who was chosen as the descendant of Huo Guang to be the Marquess of Bolu.\n\nPopular culture \nHuo Qubing is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Li Junfeng () in the popular 2005 historical epics TV series The Emperor in Han Dynasty ().\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Eddie Peng () under the name of Wei Wuji  () in the popular romance Chinese drama Sound of the Desert () derived from the book Da Mo Yao/Ballad of the Desert () by famous novel writer Tong Hua.\n\nHuo Qubing is also mentioned in the blockbuster film Dragon Blade, where the main character, played by Jackie Chan, is said to have been raised up by him. Actor Feng Shaofeng portrays the general in brief flashbacks.\n\nSee also \n Emperor Wu of Han\n Han\u2013Xiongnu War\n Jin Midi\n Ban Chao\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Joseph P Yap Wars with the Xiongnu \u2013 A translation From Zizhi tongjian AuthorHouse (2009) \n\n140 BC births\n117 BC deaths\nHan dynasty generals from Shaanxi\nHan dynasty politicians from Shaanxi\nPoliticians from Xi'an", "machine_abstract": "Huo Qu Bing (Chinese: \u80e1\u79cb\u5e73; pinyin: Huo Qi\u016bp\u00edng) (born September 16, 1974) is the current mayor of Chongqing Municipality in China.\nHe was elected to office on May 31, 2008 and took office on June 1, 2008 after his predecessor Wang Lijun resigned from office due to corruption allegations.", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Huo Qubing\".

{"id": "European Bridge League", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European%20Bridge%20League", "title": "European Bridge League", "text": "The European Bridge League is a confederation of National Bridge Federations (NBFs) that organize the card game of contract bridge in European nations. In turn the EBL organizes bridge competition at the European level. It is a member of the European Olympic Committee\nand of the World Bridge Federation, where it constitutes one of eight \"Zones\" in world bridge.\n\nBeside the administration of bridge competition (European level and European participation at the world level), the EBL provides online services for players, such as a calendar of tournaments across Europe, a list of bridge books with some reviews, and a record of major achievements by players.\n\nThe European Bridge League was established in 1947 by eight NBFs meeting in Denmark. It is incorporated in Switzerland with headquarters in Lausanne, administrative center and secretariat in Milan, Italy. From June 2010 the EBL President is Yves Aubry.\n\nEuropean bridge players are members of the national federations.  there are 49 EBL member countries (NBFs) with nearly 400,000 member players. In turn that is nearly 40% of the countries and 60% of the players under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation.\n\nContestants from EBL member countries have achieved great success at the world level. They won 22 of 27 medals in bridge at the first World Mind Sports Games, 2008 in Beijing. There were six EBL members in the field of 22 for the last national teams world championship, the 2009 Bermuda Bowl, and all six advanced to the 8-team knockout stage.\n\nMembers\nEuropean Bridge League members are National Bridge Federations and registered European bridge players are members of their national federations.  there are 49 EBL member countries (NBFs) with nearly 400,000 member players. In turn the Europeans are nearly 40% of the countries and 60% of the players under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation.\n\nGeographically the EBL members range from Iceland to Malta to Israel to Armenia, who are all members of the European Olympic Committee too. Both \"bridge Europe\" and \"Olympic Europe\" have 49 members but only 44 match. England, Scotland, and Wales compete as three nations in bridge, Denmark and Faroe Islands compete as two, but they jointly constitute Great Britain and Denmark Olympic teams. Otherwise Andorra, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, and Moldova are in Olympic Europe but do not compete in world bridge. Lebanon is in bridge Europe and Olympic Asia.\n\nThe European \"Small Federations\" competition, established 2007, is restricted to national teams from federations with no more than 500 members. Twelve to sixteen teams have participated in the first three renditions. Nineteen of the 49 EBL nations appear to be eligible.\n\nAt the other extreme, France and Netherlands account for half of the 384,000 players. Five other nations constitute another 30%: Italy, Germany, England, Denmark, and Sweden. Thus the seven largest bridge nations have 80% of Europe's registered bridge players.\n\nForty of the 49 EBL nations entered at least one national team in the latest European Team Championships (2010): 38 in the Open category, 28 Women, and 23 Senior teams.\n\nChampionships\n\nPerhaps the primary EBL responsibility is to conduct those championships which accord the title European champion.\n\nNational teams\n\nThe marquee championships for national teams are now biennial in even years. The 2012 rendition was officially the 51st, which recognizes some that predate the EBL.\n\nThe European Bridge League (est. 1947) has conducted the event from 1948 when competition was resumed after World War II. Previously and first in 1932 it was organized by the International Bridge League, predecessor of the World Bridge Federation (est. 1958).\n\nThe Open flight was first contested in 1932, the Women in 1935, and the Senior in 1995.\n\nOther\n\nThe European Open Bridge Championships are biennial in odd years since 2003.\n\nThe European Champions' Cup annually since 2002.\n\nThe EBL organizes youth events annually in July, for youth teams and pairs that represent EBL member countries.\n\nThe European Small Federations Trophy is contested by teams representing bridge nations with up to 500 members.\n\nControversy\n\nIn the 2021 European championships, Italy included Fulvio Fantoni on its team, a player previously sanctioned for cheating. In protest, the remaining national teams refused to play against the Italians and subsequently forfeited their games.\n\nSeveral national bridge associations indicated support for the forfeitures. The Italian Bridge Federation vigorously protested the actions of the forfeiting players and their National Bridge Organizations (NBO) urging that the European Bridge League expel them from the tournament.\n\nSee also\n American Contract Bridge League\n List of bridge governing bodies\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n European Bridge League\n\nContract bridge governing bodies\nSports organizations established in 1947\n1947 establishments in Denmark", "machine_abstract": "The European Bridge League (EBL) is the governing body of bridge in Europe, and was founded by seven national bridge federations on September 16, 1997 at the International Congress of Bridge Games held in Prague.\nIt has grown to include more than 50 member countries from all over Europe as well as Israel, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, USA, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Saint Vincent & The Grenadines, Antigua & Barbuda, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Jamaica, St Lucia, Barbados, Bahamas, Aruba, Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, Portugal, Spain, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City State, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia-Montenegro, Slovenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe. \nIts headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"European Bridge League\".

{"id": "Alan Menken", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan%20Menken", "title": "Alan Menken", "text": "Alan Irwin Menken (born July 22, 1949) is an American composer, songwriter, conductor, music director and record producer. Menken is best known for his scores and songs for films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. His scores and songs for The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and Pocahontas (1995) have each won him two Academy Awards. He also composed the scores and songs for Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Newsies (1992), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Home on the Range (2004), Enchanted (2007), and Tangled (2010), among others. His accolades include eight Academy Awards, a Tony Award, eleven Grammy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and a Daytime Emmy Award.\n\nHe is also known for his work in musical theater for Broadway and elsewhere. Some of these are based on his Disney films, but other stage hits include Little Shop of Horrors (1982), A Christmas Carol (1994), and Sister Act (2009).\n\nMenken has collaborated with such lyricists as Lynn Ahrens, Howard Ashman, Jack Feldman, Tim Rice, Glenn Slater, Stephen Schwartz, and David Zippel. With eight Academy Award wins, Menken is the second most prolific Oscar winner in the music categories after Alfred Newman, who has 9 Oscars. He has also won 11 Grammy Awards, a Tony Award, and a Daytime Emmy Award among many other honors. Menken is one of sixteen people to have won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony.\n\nEarly life \nAlan Irwin Menken was born on July 22, 1949, at French Hospital in Manhattan, to Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist, and his mother was an actress, dancer and playwright. His family was Jewish. Menken developed an interest in music at an early age, taking piano and violin lessons. He began to compose at an early age. At age nine, at the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest, his original composition \"Bouree\" was rated Superior and Excellent by the judges.\n\nHe attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: \"I'd make up my own Bach fugues and Beethoven sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn't want to practice; so I'd go off on tangents\". He then enrolled at New York University. He graduated with a degree in Musicology in 1971 from the university's Steinhardt School.  Menken recalled: \"First, I was pre-med. I thought I'd be a dentist like my dad. Finally, I got a degree in music, but I didn't care about musicology. It wasn't until I joined BMI Workshop ... under Lehman Engel, and walked into a room with other composers that I knew this was it.\" Menken noted that \"Before college, I was writing songs to further my dream of being the next Bob Dylan. A lot of guitar songs \u2013 I was composing on piano before that.\" After college, he attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career \nAfter graduating, Menken's plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as Midnight, Apartment House (lyric by Muriel Robinson), Conversations with Pierre, Harry the Rat and Messiah on Mott Street (lyrics by David Zippel).\n\nAccording to Menken, during this period, he \"worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for Sesame Street and a vocal coach\". He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.\n\nIn 1976, John Wilson reported for The New York Times that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the \"Broadway at the Ballroom\" series: \"The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals.\" Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: \"In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing.\"\n\nMenken contributed material to revues like New York's Back in Town, Big Apple Country, The Present Tense (1977), Real Life Funnies (Off-Broadway, 1981), Diamonds (Off-Broadway, 1984), and Personals (Off-Off-Broadway, 1985). His revue Patch, Patch, Patch ran at the West Bank Cafe in New York City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The New York Times reviewer Mel Gussow wrote: \"The title song ... refers to a life's passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge.\"\n\nMenken wrote several shows that were not produced, including Atina, Evil Queen of the Galaxy (1980), with lyrics by Steve Brown. He also wrote The Thorn with lyrics by Brown, which was commissioned by Divine in 1980. This was a parody of the film The Rose, but they could not raise the money to have it produced. He collaborated with Howard Ashman in an uncompleted musical called Babe (c. 1981), with Tom Eyen in Kicks: The Showgirl Musical (1984), and with David Rogers in The Dream in Royal Street (c. 1981), which was an adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Menken contributed music for the film The Line (1980), directed by Robert J. Siegel.\n\nBreakthrough years \nMenken finally achieved success as a composer when playwright Howard Ashman chose him and Engel to write the music for his musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. The musical opened in 1979 at the WPA Theater to excellent reviews and modest box office. It transferred after several months to the Off-Broadway Entermedia Theater, where it ran for an additional six weeks.\n\nMenken and Ashman wrote their next musical, Little Shop of Horrors, for a cast of only 9 performers, including a puppeteer. This musical is based on the 1960 black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors. It opened at WPA Theater in 1982 to warm reviews. It moved to the Off Broadway Orpheum Theatre in the East Village, Manhattan, where it ran for five years. The musical set the box-office record for highest grossing Off-Broadway show of all time. It toured around the world, won theater awards and was adapted as a 1986 musical film starring Rick Moranis that earned Menken and Ashman their first Oscar nomination for the song \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\". For his body of work in musical theatre, he was awarded the BMI Career Achievement Award in 1983.\n\nIn 1987, Menken and lyricist David Spencer's adaptation The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, based on the 1959 novel of the same name, was produced in Philadelphia. After substantial re-writes, it was produced in 2015 in Montreal. In 1992, the WPA Theatre produced Menken's Weird Romance, also with lyrics by Spencer. Menken's musical based on the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and book by Mike Ockrent, debuted at Madison Square Garden's Paramount Theater in 1994. The show proved successful and was an annual New York holiday event.\n\nDisney Renaissance and later films \nOn the strength of the success of Little Shop of Horrors, Menken and Ashman were hired by Walt Disney Studios to write the music for The Little Mermaid (1989). The challenge was to create an animated musical film of this Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that could sit alongside the Disney films Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. The Little Mermaid opened to critical and commercial success and signaled a new Disney era called the Disney Renaissance. The film gave them their first Oscar win: Best Song for the song \"Under the Sea\". Menken also won the 1989 Oscar for Best Score.\n\nMenken and Ashman's Beauty and the Beast garnered them three 1991 Oscar nominations for Best Song, winning for its title song. Menken won another Oscar for Best Score. The two were working on Aladdin at the time of Ashman's death in 1991. Ashman wrote only three songs in the film and Menken collaborated with Tim Rice, who was then working The Lion King, to write the rest of the songs for the film. The film won an Oscar in 1992 for Best Song: \"A Whole New World\". Menken also won the Oscar for Best Score. Menken's live action musical film Newsies, with lyrics by Jack Feldman, was released in 1992.\n\nThree more animated musical films followed. Menken collaborated with Stephen Schwartz for Pocahontas, for which the two won two Oscars: Best Song and Best Musical or Comedy Score. In 1996, the same musical team created the songs, and Menken, the score, for The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

It employs 23% of the Filipino workforce , according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Philippines is one of the most vulnerable agricultural systems to monsoons and other extreme weather events, which are expected to create more uncertainty as climate change effects the Philippines. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization has described the local policy measures as some of the most proactive in risk reduction.\n\nHistory\n\nProfession\n\nGrains\n\nRice \n\nThe Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of global rice production. The Philippines was also the world's largest rice importer in 2010. In 2010, nearly 15.7 million metric tons of palay (pre-husked rice) were produced. In 2010, palay accounted for 21.86% percent of gross value added in agriculture and 2.37% of GNP. Self-sufficiency in rice reached 88.93% in 2015.\n\nRice production in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1950s. Improved varieties of rice developed during the Green Revolution, including at the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines have improved crop yields. Crop yields have also improved due to increased use of fertilizers. Average productivity increased from 1.23 metric tons per hectare in 1961 to 3.59 metric tons per hectare in 2009.\n\nHarvest yields have increased significantly by using foliar fertilizer (Rc 62 -> 27% increase, Rc 80 -> 40% increase, Rc 64 -> 86% increase) based on PhilRice National Averages.\n\nThe government has been promoting the production of Golden rice.\n\nThe table below shows some of the agricultural products of the country per region.\n\nCorn/maize\n\nCorn/maize is the second most important crop in the Philippines.  600,000 farm households are employed in different businesses in the corn value chain. , around  of land is under corn cultivation and the total production was .

According to figures published in December 2015 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is the world's largest producer of coconuts, producing 19,500,000 tonnes in 2015. Production in the Philippines is generally concentrated in medium-sized farms. There are 3.5 million hectares dedicated to coconut production in the Philippines, which accounts for 25 per cent of total agricultural land in the country. In 1989, it was estimated that between 25 percent and 33 percent of the population was at least partly dependent on coconuts for their livelihood. Historically, the Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas were the centers of coconut production. In the 1980s, Western Mindanao and Southern Mindanao also became important coconut-growing regions.\n\nFruits\n\nThe Philippines is the world's third largest producer of pineapples, producing more than 2.4 million of tonnes in 2015. The Philippines was in the top three banana producing countries in 2010, including India and China. Davao and Mindanao contribute heavily to the total national banana crop. Mangoes are the third most important fruit crop of the country based on export volume and value next to bananas and pineapples.\n\nSugar \n\nThere are at least 19 provinces and 11 regions that produce sugarcane in the Philippines. A range from 360,000 to 390,000 hectares are devoted to sugarcane production. The largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts for 51% of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which accounts for 20%; Luzon by 17%; Panay by 07%; and Eastern Visayas by 04%. It is estimated that , the industry provides direct employment to 700,000 sugarcane workers spread across 19 sugar producing provinces.\n\nSugar growing in the Philippines pre-dates colonial Spanish contact. Sugar became the most important agricultural export of the Philippines between the late eighteenth century and the mid-1970s. During the 1950s and 60s, more than 20 percent income of Philippine exports came from the sugar industry. Between 1913 and 1974, the Philippines sugar industry enjoyed favoured terms of trade with the US, with special access to the protected and subsidized the American sugar market.\n\nAnimal agriculture\n\nCrocodile\n\nOstrich\n\nOther crops\n\nAbaca \n\nAccording to the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority, the Philippines provided 87.4% of the world's abaca in 2014, earning the Philippines US$111.33 million.  The demand is still greater than the supply.  The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%).  The Bicol region in the Philippines produced 27,885 metric tons of abaca in 2014, the largest of any Philippine region.  The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009\u20132013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca production while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes Island.

From an early age he was attracted to painting.\n\nHis uncle, the sculptor Jules Printemps, a student of Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy at the \u00c9cole nationale des Beaux-Arts, supported his vocation and prepared him for the entrance examination to this school. He was admitted in 1892, joined the workshop of Gustave Moreau and regularly visited it until Moreau\u2019s death in 1898. He also associated with such artists as  Rouault, Matisse, Evenepoel, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence and Charles Milcendeau.\n\nAround this period his work was largely part of the Symbolist movement and he experimented with a poetic or mythological vision and with the sensuality of the female nude.\n\nWork\n\nPortrait painter \nHe soon established his reputation as a portrait artist receiving commissions from such eminent personalities as Sully Prudhomme, the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Prince and Princess of Waldeck, Mr and Mrs Commettant, and Prince Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps married in 1903 and frequently painted his family in an intimate tone, particularly his daughter Lucile whose death at the age of 6 touched him profoundly, as well as his son Ren\u00e9.\n\nLandscape painter \nL\u00e9on Printemps was a landscape painter his entire life. His desire to meet Flemish masters prompted him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century, returning home with various studies. \nLater in life his attraction to the beaches of Normandy, which were quite fashionable at the time, became more marked. After the First World War he started painting landscapes in Brittany and particularly the islands of the Vend\u00e9e coast, the island of Noirmoutier, the island of Yeu, where he painted seascapes and portraits of fishermen and old farmers\u2019 wives.\n\nFlemish and Dutch influence \nThe appeal of the work of Flemish and Dutch masters during Printemps\u2019 visits to the Louvre Museum inspired him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands on several occasions with a desire to better understand the art of these great Flemish and Dutch masters. Several paintings, which were the outcome of his first visits to Belgium, were presented at the Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais (1898 and 1905), the Salon artistique des PTT (1905) and in regional exhibitions, in Lille (1898) and in Nantes (1906).\n\nIn 1894 Printemps travelled to Belgium for the first time, presumably in the company of other students of Gustave Moreau, visiting Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp. Two years later he travelled to the Meuse Valley where he painted the Bayard Rock, a remarkable sight in Dinant. In 1897, he spent some time in the Netherlands visiting the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1898, he returned to Bruges and Mechelen. In 1929 and 1933 he also took his son Ren\u00e9, who was also studying to become a painter at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, on a trip to explore these two cities.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps died on 9 July 1945, in his studio at 6 rue Furstenberg, where the Mus\u00e9e National Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix is currently located.\n\nGallery\n\nParticipation in Exhibitions \u2013 Awards and Merits \n Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais, between 1893 and 1939.

{"id": "Incarnate (film)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnate%20%28film%29", "title": "Incarnate (film)", "text": "Incarnate is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed by Brad Peyton and written by Ronnie Christensen. It stars Aaron Eckhart, Carice van Houten,  Catalina Sandino Moreno, David Mazouz,  Keir O'Donnell, Matt Nable, and John Pirruccello.\n\nThe film was released on December 2, 2016, by Blumhouse Tilt and High Top Releasing.\n\nPlot\nAn 11-year-old boy named Cameron Sparrow is attacked by a hooded stranger who tries to kill him. However, Cameron kills her instead and looks at the camera with red eyes, revealing that he is actually possessed by a demon named \"Maggie\".\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Seth Ember approaches a man named Henry in a club and makes him realize he is dreaming. Ember reveals that the woman Henry has been with is a demon who has possessed his body. The two escape and return to reality, and Henry is freed from the demon. In the waking world, Ember actually uses a wheelchair. Ember's assistant Oliver warns that the demons have started to adapt to Ember's efforts and that soon he may not be able to escape back to reality.\n\nEmber is approached by Camilla, a representative from the Vatican, who asks him to exorcise Cameron. Ember refuses, stating that his methods are not \"exorcisms,\" but Camilla reveals that she believes the demon is one Ember knows. Ember visits a priest named Felix to question whether the demon could indeed be Maggie, which Felix affirms. Felix offers him a vial of blood from a possessed man which, when injected, would allow Ember about ten seconds of lucidity - just enough time to commit suicide, but he refuses.\n\nEmber meets the boy's mother Lindsay and explains that he does not exorcise demons but evicts them by entering their host's subconscious to make them realize they are dreaming. Demons do not have the power to truly control those they possess; instead, they lull their hosts into comforting dreams so they will be unaware while the demon uses their body. He visits the possessed Cameron and the demon recognizes him.\n\nEmber, Oliver, and, the third member of their team, Riley prepare for the eviction. Riley explains that by entering a near-death state, Ember will be able to synchronize his brain frequencies to Cameron's and enter his subconscious. However in this state, Ember has only about eight minutes before his heart will give out. Ember enters Cameron's dream and sees him with his father, Dan, but has a seizure and has to be pulled out of the dream to be revived.\n\nEmber demands that Dan be present to help evict the demon. Lindsay refuses, explaining that the couple separated after Dan broke Cameron's arm in a drunken rage, but she agrees when Ember insists that Cameron's father might be the only way to save Cameron. Dan's presence initially seems to help, but Maggie lashes out at him. Ember pleads with Maggie to release Dan since Ember is the one Maggie wants. The demon does so but Dan dies from his injuries. Lindsay, alarmed, demands to know Ember's history with the demon. Ember reveals he discovered that he had the power to perform astral projection and enter the dreams of other people, but hid his power to live a normal life. However, this made him a target for demons. One day, while driving with his wife and child, the three were hit by a car driven by a possessed driver. The attack left Ember's family dead and is the reason that he needs to use a wheelchair, and ever since, he's been hunting the demon \"Maggie,\" whom he named after the woman it had possessed.\n\nEmber visits Felix to acquire the blood vial but discovers that Felix has been possessed. Felix attacks Ember and commits suicide. Returning to Cameron's dream, Ember uses a ring Cameron had received as a gift from his real father to make the boy realize he is in an illusion. The pair flee from Maggie, and Ember helps Cameron escape. Ember and Cameron wake up, but Ember wakes up again in a hospital with his wife and son. He realizes he's now inside his own dream and begs Maggie to release Cameron and take him instead, to which the demon agrees. However, when Ember wakes up, Riley administers the blood and Ember uses his ten seconds to throw himself through the apartment window. As he dies, Riley warns everybody not to touch Ember's body.\n\nParamedics attempt to resuscitate Ember, joined by Camilla. They succeed in getting a heartbeat, allowing Maggie to possess Camilla, before Ember dies.\n\nCast\n Aaron Eckhart as Dr. Seth Ember\n Carice van Houten as Lindsay Sparrow\n David Mazouz as Cameron Sparrow\n Catalina Sandino Moreno as Camilla Marquez\n Keir O'Donnell as Oliver\n  Emily Jackson as Riley\n Matthew Nable as Dan Sparrow\n Karolina Wydra as Anna Ember\n Emjay Anthony as Jake Ember\n John Purruccello as Henry\n  Mark Steger as Maggie (Demon)\n Tomas Arana as Felix\n Mark Henry as Bouncer #2\n\nProduction\nBrad Peyton was hired to direct & executive producer the film.

It ended up grossing $2.5 million, finishing 9th at the box office.\n\nCritical response\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 17% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The critic consensus reads: \"Incarnate can't be accused of lack of ideas -- if only any of them made sense or coalesced in any meaningful or scary way\". On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score 30 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n2016 films\n2016 horror thriller films\n2016 horror films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican science fiction horror films\nAmerican science fiction thriller films\nAmerican supernatural horror films\nAmerican supernatural thriller films\n2010s English-language films\nDemons in film\nReligious horror films\nFilms about exorcism\nFilms about paraplegics or quadriplegics\nBlumhouse Productions films\nWWE Studios films\nUniversal Pictures films\nFilms directed by Brad Peyton\nFilms produced by Jason Blum\nFilms scored by Andrew Lockington", "machine_abstract": "The film is about the life of Jesus Christ, from his birth to his death and resurrection.\nPlot summary[edit]\nIn this movie we see how God sent His son into our world as man so that He could die on the cross in order to save us all.

{"id": "Sobib\u00f3r Museum", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobib%C3%B3r%20Museum", "title": "Sobib\u00f3r Museum", "text": "The Sobib\u00f3r Museum, or the Museum of the Former Sobib\u00f3r Nazi Death Camp (), is a Polish state-owned museum devoted to memorializing the victims and atrocities committed at the former Sobibor extermination camp, located on the outskirts of Sobib\u00f3r near Lublin. The Nazi German death camp was set up in occupied Poland during World War II, as part of the Jewish extermination program known as the Operation Reinhard, which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland. The camp was run by the SS Sonderkommando Sobibor, initially commanded by Franz Stangl. The number of Jews from Poland and elsewhere who were gassed and cremated there between April 1942 and October 14, 1943, is estimated at 250,000; possibly more, including those who were transported from other Reich-occupied countries.\n\nSince May 1, 2012, the Sobib\u00f3r Museum has been managed as a branch of the Majdanek State Museum, dedicated to the history and commemoration of the Holocaust camps and subcamps of KL Lublin. Originally, the museum served as a branch of the district museum in nearby W\u0142odawa, founded in 1981. The museum was temporarily closed to the public from April 2011 to May 2013 due to lack of funds. The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage reopened the Museum with additional funding after its administrative reorganisation.\n\nArchaeological and conservation work was conducted at the site between 2007 and 2017, revealing formerly buried features of the camp and thousands of items belonging to the victims. The mass grave site was covered with geotextile and crushed marble in 2017. In 2020, a new Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r was inaugurated, with 323-square meters of exhibition space, displaying a permanent exhibition artifacts, photographs and documents.\n\nMuseum history\n\nBecause the Nazis had closed and destroyed the camp in late 1943, replanting the site to hide the evidence of what had taken place, little was known about the camp for years. The Sobibor trial in Hagen, Germany, and the parallel Hiwi, or Trawniki trials in Krasnodar in the former USSR brought publicity to the Nazi-directed activities at this death camp. These trials were inspired by the investigative work of Simon Wiesenthal, and the highly publicized capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 from Argentina by the Israeli Mossad, to stand trial in Jerusalem.\n\nMost Holocaust survivors had left Poland long before these events, and few from the camp are known to have survived the war. The camp was largely forgotten.\n\nThe first monument to Sobib\u00f3r victims was erected in 1965 on the historic site. The W\u0142odawa Museum, which commissioned the monument, established a separate Sobib\u00f3r branch on October 14, 1993, on the 50th anniversary of the armed uprising of Jewish prisoners there. After some 300 prisoners escaped in 1943, the Nazis closed and destroyed the camp to try to hide the evidence of the mass killings. Only 58 of those former prisoners are known to have survived the war.\n\nThe small museum was scheduled to be replaced with a modern visitor centre, with a design chosen from an international design competition in 2013, sponsored by the Polish-German Foundation Pojednanie. On June 24, 2014, the State Secretary from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage presented the winning design at a ceremony in Warsaw. Attending were the King of the Netherlands Willem Alexander and his wife Queen M\u00e1xima, partners in the project along with Israel, Poland, and Slovakia. After parts of the former camp grounds were excavated by archeologists and the field of mass graves covered with geotextile and crushed marble, construction work on the new museum complex began in 2017.\n\nThe permanent exhibition of the new Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r was inaugurated on October 29, 2020, with 323 square meters of exhibition space. Over 700 personal items belonging to the victims of the camp, from among 11,000 artifacts held by the museum, as well as documents and photographs, form the centerpiece of the exhibition. Sixteen thematic areas explain the history of the extermination camp and the Holocaust in occupied Poland.\n\nResearch and conservation programs\n\nThe Museum complex comprises a building, archives, and monuments. The museum building is located near the former railway station; these are connected by a paved Trail of Memory. Memorial monuments include a cast-iron statue of a woman with child, sculpted by Mieczys\u0142aw Welter. It is installed on the former \"Road to Heaven\" (Himmelfahrtstrasse). In addition, a large circular enclosure has a mound of ashes and crushed bones of the victims, collected at the site and formed into a broad pyramid next to the original open-air cremation pits. A local archive of the facsimiles of testimonies and pertinent documents is available at the museum.\n\nThe camp is scheduled to undergo more advanced geophysical studies and further archaeological excavations to explore the site. Practically no fixed objects of any kind are found within the site, since the SS meticulously removed as much evidence as possible. Any research work around and near the graves is conducted under the strict supervision of the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich.\n\nThe first excavation project was completed in October 2007. More than one thousand items belonging to the victims were unearthed. In October 2009, the second excavation phase was conducted, which determined the exact placement of double-row barbed-wire fencing posts around the camp. The work revealed numerous new artifacts as well, including false teeth, keepsakes from Marienbad, and many suitcase keys.  In the autumn of 2012, the north-western section around mass graves 1 and 2 was analyzed. Geophysical  evidence was found of the barbed-wire enclosure that separated mass graves and cremation pits from the living area of Camp III, and that marked the perimeter of the killing zone.\n\nIn May 2013 the Israeli and Polish archaeologists conducting excavations near Camp III, unearthed an escape tunnel  long and 1.6\u20132\u00a0m deep in some places, beginning under the barracks of the Jewish Sonderkommando and leading toward a double-row, barbed-wire fence. The tunnel may have collapsed with people inside; the camp perimeter is known to have been mined. Notably, the camp records do not mention any incident related to a tunnel escape.\n\nOther new findings included children's identification tags from the Netherlands, and seven human skeletal remains. These may be remains of the Jewish work-detail who were shot after completing removal of the genocide evidence.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Museum and Memorial in Sobib\u00f3r \u2013 Official site (English)\n \"Sobibor.

{"id": "Calgary Tigers", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary%20Tigers", "title": "Calgary Tigers", "text": "The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the Bengals, were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big-4 League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League. The Tigers were revived in 1932, playing for a short-lived four years in the North Western Hockey League. They played their games at the Victoria Arena.\n\nCreated ostensibly as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the Allan Cup, the Tigers helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary. In 1924, after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships, the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup.\n\nAfter succumbing to financial pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid-1930s as a minor professional club. The Tigers competed for a total of eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nHistory\n\nBig-4 League\nIn 1919, under the guidance of Alberta Amateur Hockey Association league president Allan McCaw, a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton. The Big-4 League's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup, emblematic of Canada's national senior championship. The Tigers were created in 1920, along with the Canadians, to represent Calgary in the Big Four after the city's two original teams, the Wanderers and Columbus Crew, withdrew following the league's first season.  The Tigers also faced the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions who served as representatives of Alberta's capital.  The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena, which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918.\n\nWhile the Big-4 billed itself as an amateur circuit, it became known as a notorious example of a \"shamateur\" league, as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition.  When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association demanding that the league be declared professional, thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup. The Big Four ultimately chose to withdraw from the AAHA, and operated as an independent league in 1920\u201321.\n\nThe Tigers' inaugural game was played at home on December 29, 1920 as 2,500 fans saw them defeat the Edmonton Dominions 6\u20131 on the strength of a goal and two assists by Gordon Fraser.  Late in the season, the Canadians protested the use of goaltender Bill Tobin by the Edmonton Eskimos, arguing that he had not lived in Alberta long enough to be eligible per the league's residency rules. Following a last minute change of one of the arbitrators, a three-man panel denied the protest.  The decision led the front-running Tigers to refuse to play any series against the second-place Eskimos for the league championship as the team felt the Canadians' protest was improperly handled.  Efforts to reach a compromise failed as the Edmonton clubs refused to allow the protest to be reconsidered, resulting in the collapse of the league on February 24, 1921.\n\nThe Tigers remained active despite the demise of the league, playing a series of exhibition games against the Saskatoon Crescents and a team from Moose Jaw.  The Eskimos eventually agreed to face the Tigers without Tobin in an informal championship that was known as the  Intercity Championship.  The Tigers claimed the title on total-goals as they defeated Edmonton 2\u20130 in the first game at Calgary before dropping the second 2\u20131 at Edmonton.   The Tigers ended their season with a 2\u20130 exhibition loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators, who were touring the country as they travelled west to defend their title against the PCHA champion Vancouver Millionaires.\n\nWestern Canada Hockey League\n\nThe former Big Four teams joined with the Saskatoon Sheiks in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Western Canada Hockey League was recognized as a major league and granted the right to compete for the Stanley Cup. Shortly before the inaugural season was set to begin, Calgary Canadians president Dr. C.E. Coleman and Tigers manager Eddie Poulin agreed amalgamate the two franchises under the Tigers name, allowing Calgary to present a unified front in the new league.\n\nThe Tigers played the first professional hockey game in Calgary on December 19, 1921, defeating the Regina Capitals 3\u20132 before a crowd of 3,000 fans.   The Tigers, Eskimos and Capitals battled for first place in the league, each team holding the top spot numerous times throughout the season. The Tigers and Capitals finished tied for second, forcing a two-game, total-goals playoff to determine who would meet the Eskimos for the league championship.  In the series, the Capitals defeated the Tigers 1\u20130 in Calgary, while the two teams tied 1\u20131 in Regina sending the Capitals through by a 2\u20131 aggregate total.\n\nPrior to the start of the 1922\u201323 season, the Tigers faced the Stanley Cup champion Toronto St. Patricks in two exhibition games.   They defeated the St. Pats 7\u20135 in Calgary, and again 6\u20132 in a game held in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The WCHL and PCHA adopted an interlocking schedule for this season, with the Tigers struggling against their pacific coast opposition, winning just two of six games. Calgary finished third in the standings, behind Edmonton and Regina, as former Tiger Barney Stanley scored the winning goal against Calgary in a 2\u20131 victory by the Regina Capitals that eliminated Calgary from playoff contention. They ended the season with a 4\u20130 exhibition victory over the NHL's Ottawa Senators in a game described as one of the \"most sensational\" games ever held in Calgary.\n\nThe 1923\u201324 season began with tragedy, as Tigers' forward Foley Martin died of blood poisoning during the team's season opening road trip to the pacific coast.  The Tigers played on despite Martin's death, winning two of three games against their PCHA rivals.  The Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points. They met the Regina Capitals in the league championship in a two-game, total goals series. After battling Regina to a 2\u20132 draw in the Saskatchewan capital, the Tigers returned home to Calgary, capturing the championship on home ice in a 2\u20130 victory. They then moved on to face the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA in the best-of-three Western Canadian final. After dropping the first game in Vancouver, the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6\u20133 at home, and again 3\u20131 at a neutral site game in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the Stanley Cup, the first such opportunity for a Calgary-based club.\n\nDespite defeating the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6\u20131. Due to poor ice conditions, the second game was moved to the Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3\u20130 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.\n\nCalgary began the 1924\u201325 season with a series of exhibition games in eastern Canada.  They faced the St. Pats and Senators, proving to be a popular draw in the capital as Ottawa fans lined up for tickets for the pair of games played. Additionally, the Tigers negotiated to face the NHL's expansion Montreal Maroons if the newly constructed Montreal Forum was ready in time. Those games did not come to pass. In WCHL league play, the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place.  Led by Oliver's team leading 20 goals, the Tigers earned a bye into the WCHL championship. Their opponent was the Victoria Cougars, who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer. The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, losing the two-game total-goals series 3\u20131.  The Cougars went on to become the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The Tigers struggled throughout the 1925\u201326 season, languishing in last place for most of the season until a 2\u20130 victory over Victoria on the last day of the season moved Calgary one point ahead of Vancouver to end the season.\n\nThe financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league.  The prairie clubs, including the Tigers, were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925\u201326 reduced the quality of the natural ice at Victoria arena which, coupled with the team's poor performance, reduced attendance.  Manager Lance Turner confirmed on May 4, 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League, along with the franchises in Edmonton, Regina, Victoria, Vancouver and Portland, and that the league had ceased operations. The six franchises were sold for $300,000.\n\nTurner immediately began efforts to form a new team and league that would operate as a \"class B\" league, one level below the NHL. Three weeks after the collapse of the Western League, the Tigers were reformed as a charter member of the five team Prairie Hockey League. The team struggled to attract fans in the Prairie League, and consequently announced late in the season that it would cease operations after one year. The Tigers were successful on the ice, however, as they finished atop the league standings and met the Saskatoon Sheiks in a best-of-three series for the league title. Calgary dropped the first game, 2\u20131 in Saskatoon, but tied the series with a 2\u20131 victory in Calgary on the strength of two goals in the last five minutes by Andy Aikenhead. The Tigers were then awarded the league championship after the Sheiks defaulted the third game, refusing to play in opposition to the referee assigned for the deciding game. As Prairie champions, the Tigers traveled east to face the Winnipeg Maroons for the western Canadian professional championship. Calgary won the first game, then were awarded the title after the Maroons were unable to play the second game when the American Hockey Association rescheduled their league playoff series and created a conflict. The Tigers ended their season with exhibition games in the United States before the team was disbanded.\n\nNorth Western Hockey League\n\nIn 1932, the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed, minor-professional, Western Canada Hockey League. They opened the season with a 1\u20130 defeat in Edmonton on December 7, 1932 in what was the first professional game for either city in six years, while a near capacity crowd of 4,100 fans witnessed a 7\u20130 victory by the Tigers over the Eskimos two nights later in Calgary. The Tigers finished the season in first place with on the strength of giving up the fewest goals against during the season, but struggled to attract fans.  Attendance declined throughout the season to a low of just 560 for their victory over Saskatoon in early March that clinched the league's top record.  Overall, the team averaged 2,270 fans per game. Having earned a bye to the championship series, the Tigers faced the Eskimos in a best-of-five series marred by poor ice caused unseasonably warm weather in both cities. Following a 1\u20131 tie in the first game at Calgary, the league ordered the remaining games of the series be played in Edmonton due to the poor condition of the ice surface. The second game was also tied at 1 after bad ice in Edmonton forced it to be ended early. Two victories for the Eskimos pushed Calgary to the brink of elimination before the Tigers rebounded with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth game.  The ties earlier in the series forced the teams to a sixth game that also went to overtime tied at 1 before the Eskimos scored to win the championship after four minutes of an extra period.\n\nThe league reformed as the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out and were replaced with three teams on the Pacific Coast.  Calgary again won the regular-season title in 1933\u201334, advancing directly to the league championship, on the strength of a 12\u20133 victory over the Vancouver Lions in the final game of the regular season. Dutch Gainor won the league scoring title with 43 points. Fearing a repeat of the previous season's playoff disaster, the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the Lions in Seattle and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice. The disadvantage did not affect the Tigers in the opening game of the series, a 5\u20132 victory at Seattle. The teams traded victories in the next three contests, ending in a 2\u20131 Vancouver win in the fourth game that tied the series at 2 wins apiece. Calgary won the championship with a 6\u20131 victory before a Vancouver crowd of over 6,000 fans.\n\nThe 1934 championship would prove to be the Tigers' last hurrah, as the team fell to the bottom of the NWHL standings in 1934\u201335, winning only three games. They once again finished in last place in 1935\u201336 and were embroiled in another disputer with Edmonton over the rights to a player as the Eskimos claimed they had gained the rights to Tony Savage from the Montreal Canadiens though he had already been sent to Calgary on loan.  The Tigers issued an ultimatum to the league, threatening to disband for the season if Savage did not remain in Calgary. Savage ultimately remained with Calgary for the entire season.\n\n1936 proved to be the final year for the Tigers, as the Great Depression and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of the senior game had threatened the team's viability. After the Eskimos announced intentions to relocate to Victoria, British Columbia as part of a realignment of the league, Tigers' manager Clair Manning contemplated relocating the franchise to Spokane, Washington. The team instead hoped to operate for another season in Calgary, but met its final demise after the NWHL reformed into the Pacific Coast Hockey League for 1936\u201337 and denied the Tigers' application to join the new league.\n\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\n\n\u2020Denotes Tigers' record when the league collapsed.  Exhibition games played after are not included\n\nHall of Famers\n\nThe WCHL's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.\n\nBarney Stanley, a former PCHA star, spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920\u201322. Joining the Tigers in the last season of the Big Four League, he once again turned pro when the Tigers joined the WCHL.  Stanley led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921\u201322 before being traded to Regina.  Red Dutton, a World War I veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound, played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans.  Rusty Crawford, a former standout in the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League before the war, spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922\u201325.  Crawford recorded 19 goals in 64 games as a Tiger.\n\nHerb Gardiner began his professional career in Calgary in 1920, remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926, where he would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927.  Harry Oliver also began his pro career in Calgary, playing with the Tigers from 1921\u201326 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the Boston Bruins. Oliver would go on to play eleven seasons in the NHL with the Bruins and New York Americans.\n\nHead coaches\nBarney Stanley (1921\u201322)\nHerb Gardiner (1922\u201326)\n\nLegacy\nThe uniform of the Calgary Tigers served as the inspiration for the \"vintage\" uniform of the Calgary Flames which was worn in the Heritage Classic game in February 2011. While the Calgary Flames do not trace their ancestry back to the Tigers (the Atlanta Flames club was purchased by Calgary businessmen in the 1980s), the organization had wanted to recognize the first professional hockey club in Calgary history for this event and selected the colourful uniforms of the Tigers.\n\nSee also\nList of ice hockey teams in Alberta\nIce hockey in Calgary\nCalgary Cowboys\nCalgary Flames\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nGeneral\n\nDefunct ice hockey teams in Canada\nTigers, Calgary\nIce hockey teams in Alberta\nIce hockey clubs established in 1920\n1920 establishments in Alberta", "machine_abstract": "The Calgary Tigers are the Canadian football team of University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nThey compete in NCAA Division III as members of the Western Collegiate Football Conference (WCC).

It is their last album to reach the Billboard 200, reaching #122, and contains their last top 40 hit in the United States, \"That's the Way\", which reached #16. It was their last studio album released in the United States and the first and only release for the SBK label (the band would briefly move to Virgin Records just before it was sold to Capitol's then-owner EMI).\n\nBackground and critical reception\nAfter being dropped by Capitol Records following 1986's Waves album, Katrina and the Waves secured a new deal with SBK Records, which released the more rock-oriented Break of Hearts. Despite a US Top 20 hit with \"That's the Way\", it was their only album for the label. Singer Katrina Leskanich said on the band's website, \"SBK told us that they could see us as a stadium band, Bryan Adams style, and [guitarist Kimberley Rew] was coming up with this stuff that was perfect for rock radio.\" Retrospective reviews were less than positive. Trouser Press described the album as a \"horrendously wrongheaded comeback bid that shows the Waves to be utterly oblivious to their own strengths,\" calling it \"bland, overprocessed commercial slop.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide felt that the writing was \"empty and mannered.\" Rew was quoted on the website saying, \"We've never been successful enough to be immune from the influences of producers and marketing men ... the more we fell for those 80s trademarks, the more we diluted the band.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nKatrina and the Waves\nKatrina Leskanich \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\nKimberley Rew \u2013 lead guitar, vocals, keyboards\nVince de la Cruz \u2013 bass, additional guitars, vocals, keyboards\nAlex Cooper \u2013 drums, vocals, keyboards\nAdditional musicians\nNick Glennie-Smith \u2013 additional keyboards\nStevie Lange \u2013 backing vocals\nShirley Lewis \u2013 backing vocals\nDee Lewis \u2013 backing vocals\nJimmy Helms \u2013 backing vocals\nGeorge Chandler \u2013 backing vocals\nJimmy Chambers \u2013 backing vocals\nTechnical\nKatrina and the Waves \u2013 producer\nJay Burnett \u2013 additional production, engineer, mixing\nStephen Stewart \u2013 engineer  \nMark Sayer-Wade \u2013 engineer \nMike Vindice \u2013 additional engineer \nDennis Herman \u2013 additional engineer \nPat Collier \u2013 additional engineer \nSarah Jarman \u2013 assistant engineer \nSimon Lee \u2013 assistant engineer  \nVicente Roix \u2013 assistant engineer  \nNigel Green \u2013 mixing \nPaul Cox \u2013 front cover photography\nRobin Emilien \u2013 back cover photography\n\nCharts\n\nSingles\n\nNotes \n\nKatrina and the Waves albums\n1989 albums\nSBK Records albums\nAttic Records albums", "machine_abstract": "Break of Hearts is the second studio album by American rock band Heart released in 1988 on Atlantic Records and was certified gold after one week, platinum within three weeks, double-platinum six months later, triple-platinum two years later, quadruple-platinum four years later, quintuple-platinum five years later, sextuple-platinum seven years later, and finally eight times Platinum ten years later.\nThe title track reached No.\u00a01 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart while also reaching No.\u00a02 on Cash Box' Top 40 Mainstream Rock Tracks chart; it has been covered numerous times since its release including by The Beatles who recorded their own version as well as being featured prominently in the film Back to the Future Part II.", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Break of Hearts (album)\".

{"id": "Sampling (music)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling%20%28music%29", "title": "Sampling (music)", "text": "In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware (samplers) or software such as digital audio workstations.\n\nA process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with musique concr\u00e8te, experimental music created by splicing and looping tape. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. The term sampling was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the Fairlight CMI, a synthesizer with the ability to record and play back short sounds. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.\n\nSampling is a foundation of hip hop music, which emerged with 1980s producers sampling funk and soul records, particularly drum breaks. It has since influenced many genres of music, particularly electronic music and pop. Samples such as the Amen break, the \"Funky Drummer\" drum break and orchestra hit have been used in thousands of recordings; James Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Fab Five Freddy and Led Zeppelin are among the most sampled artists. The first album created entirely from samples, Endtroducing by DJ Shadow, was released in 1996.\n\nSampling without permission can infringe copyright or may be fair use. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as clearance, and can be complex and costly; samples from well known sources may be prohibitively expensive. Courts have taken different positions on whether sampling without permission is permitted. In Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc (1991) and Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films (2005), the courts ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes copyright infringement; however, VMG Salsoul v Ciccone (2016) found that unlicensed samples constituted de minimis copying, and did not infringe copyright.\n\nPrecursors \n\nIn the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed musique concr\u00e8te, an experimental form of music created by recording sounds to tape, splicing them, and manipulating them to create sound collages. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils. The method also involved tape loops, splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely. Schaeffer developed the Phonogene, which played loops at 12 different pitches triggered by a keyboard.\n\nComposers including John Cage, Edgar Var\u00e8se, Karheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis experimented with musique concr\u00e8te, and Bebe and Louis Barron used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. Musique concr\u00e8te was brought to a mainstream audience by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which used the techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including Doctor Who.\n\nIn the 1960s, Jamaican dub reggae producers such as King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry began using recordings of reggae rhythms to produce riddim tracks, which were then deejayed over. Jamaican immigrants introduced the techniques to American hip hop music in the 1970s. British producer Brian Eno cited German musician Holger Czukay's experiments with Dictaphones and shortwave radios as examples of early sampling.\n\nSamplers \n\nThe Guardian described the Chamberlin as the first sampler, developed by the English engineer Harry Chamberlin in the 1940s. The Chamberlin used a keyboard to trigger a series of tape decks, each containing eight seconds of sound. Similar technology was popularised in the 60s with the Mellotron. In 1969, the English engineer Peter Zinovieff developed the first digital sampler, the EMS Musys.\n\nThe term sample was coined by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogel to describe a feature of their Fairlight CMI synthesizer, launched in 1979. While developing the Fairlight, Vogel recorded around a second of a piano performance from a radio broadcast, and discovered that he could imitate a piano by playing the recording back at different pitches. The result better resembled a real piano than sounds generated by synthesizers.\n\nCompared to later samplers, the Fairlight was limited; it allowed control over pitch and envelope, and could only record a few seconds of sound. However, the sampling function became its most popular feature. Though the concept of reusing recordings in other recordings was not new, the Fairlight's design and built-in sequencer simplified the process. The Fairlight inspired competition, improving sampling technology and driving down prices. Early competitors included the E-mu Emulator and the Akai S950. Drum machines such as the Oberheim DMX and Linn LM-1 incorporated samples of drum kits and percussion rather than generating sounds from circuits. Early samplers could store samples of only a few seconds in length, but this increased with improved memory.\nIn 1988, Akai released the first MPC sampler, which allowed users to assign samples to pads and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a keyboard or drum kit. It was followed by competing samplers from companies including Korg, Roland and Casio. Today, most samples are recorded and edited using digital audio workstations such as Pro Tools and Ableton Live.\n\nImpact \nSampling has influenced many genres of music, particularly pop, hip hop and electronic music; Guardian journalist David McNamee likened its importance in these genres to the guitar's importance in rock. Sampling is a fundamental element of remix culture. Commonly sampled elements include strings, basslines, drum loops, vocal hooks, or entire bars of music, especially from soul records. Samples may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. As sampling technology has improved, the possibilities for manipulation have grown.\n\nEarly works \nUsing the Fairlight, the \"first truly world-changing sampler\", producer Trevor Horn became the \"key architect\" in incorporating sampling into pop music in the 1980s. Other users of the Fairlight included Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran, Herbie Hancock, Todd Rundgren, Icehouse and Ebn Ozn. In the 1980s, samples were incorporated into synthesizers and music workstations, such as the bestselling Korg M1, released in 1988.\n\nThe Akai MPC, released in 1988, had a major influence on electronic and hip hop music, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without other instruments, a studio or formal music knowledge. Its designer, Roger Linn, anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as individual notes or drum hits, to use as building blocks for compositions; however, users sampled longer passages of music. In the words of Greg Milner, author of Perfecting Sound Forever, musicians \"didn't just want the sound of John Bonham's kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of 'When the Levee Breaks'.\" Linn said: \"It was a very pleasant surprise. After 60 years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?\"\n\nStevie Wonder's 1979 album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants may have been the first album to make extensive use of samples. The Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra were pioneers in sampling, constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them; their album Technodelic (1981) is an early example of an album consisting mostly of samples. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) by David Byrne and Brian Eno is another important early work of sampling, incorporating samples of sources including Arabic singers, radio DJs and an exorcist. Musicians had used similar techniques before, but, according to Guardian writer Dave Simpson, sampling had never before been used \"to such cataclysmic effect\". Eno felt the album's innovation was to make samples \"the lead vocal\". Big Audio Dynamite pioneered sampling in rock and pop with their 1985 album This Is Big Audio Dynamite.\n\nHip hop \nSampling is one of the foundations of hip hop, which emerged in the 1980s. Hip hop sampling has been likened to the origins of blues and rock, which were created by repurposing existing music. Guardian journalist David McNamee wrote that, in the 1980s, sampling in hip hop had been a political act, the \"working-class black answer to punk\".\n\nBefore the rise of sampling, DJs used turntables to loop breaks from records, which MCs would rap over. Compilation albums such as Ultimate Breaks and Beats compiled tracks with drum breaks and solos intended for sampling, and were aimed at DJs and hip hop producers. In 1986, the tracks \"South Bronx\", \"Eric B. is President\" and \"It's a Demo\" sampled the funk and soul tracks of James Brown, particularly a drum break from \"Funky Drummer\", helping popularize the technique. \n\nThe advent of affordable samplers such as the Akai MPC (1988) made looping easier. With a ten-second sample length and a distinctive \"gritty\" sound, the E-mu SP-1200, released in 1987, was used extensively by East Coast producers during the golden age of hip hop of the late 1980s and early 90s. Guinness World Records cites DJ Shadow's acclaimed hip hop album Endtroducing (1996), made almost entirely on an MPC60, as the first album created entirely from samples.\n\nCommon samples \n\n \nA seven-second drum break in the 1969 track \"Amen, Brother\", known as the Amen break, became popular with American hip hop producers and then British jungle producers in the early 1990s. It has been used in thousands of recordings, including songs by rock bands such as Oasis and in theme tunes for television shows such as Futurama. According to WhoSampled, a user-generated website cataloging samples, \"Amen, Brother\" is the most sampled track in history, appearing in over 5000 tracks as of 2021. \n\nIn 2018, the Smithsonian cited the most sampled track as \"Change the Beat\" by Fab Five Freddy, which appears in more than 1,150 tracks. WhoSampled cites James Brown as the most sampled artist, appearing in more than 3000 tracks. The Independent named the American singer Loleatta Holloway \"the most sampled female voice in popular music\"; her vocals were sampled in house and dance tracks such as \"Ride on Time\" by Black Box, the bestselling single of 1989.\n\nThe drum break from the 1970 James Brown song \"Funky Drummer\" is one of the most influential samples. The 1972 Lyn Collins song \"Think (About It)\", written by Brown, includes another widely sampled drum break, featuring the cries \"Woo!\" \"Yeah!\" by Brown and Bobby Byrd. The drums in Led Zeppelin's recording of \"When the Levee Breaks\", played by John Bonham, is another of the most widely sampled drum breaks, used by artists including the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem and Massive Attack. \n\nThe orchestra hit originated as a sound on the Fairlight sampled from Stravinsky's 1910 orchestral work Firebird Suite and became a hip hop cliche. MusicRadar cited the Zero-G Datafiles sample libraries as a major influence on dance music in the early 90s, becoming the \"de facto source of breakbeats, bass and vocal samples\".\n\nLegal and ethical issues \nTo legally use a sample, an artist must acquire legal permission from the copyright holder, a potentially lengthy and complex process known as clearance. Sampling without permission can breach the copyright of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a rhythm or guitar riff. The moral rights of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling. In some cases, sampling is protected under American fair use laws, which grant \"limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holder\".Richard Lewis Spencer, who owned the copyright for the widely sampled Amen break, never received royalties for its use; he condemned the sampling as plagiarism, but later said it was flattering. Journalist Simon Reynolds likened the situation to \"the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children\". In 1989, the Turtles sued De La Soul for using an uncleared sample on their album 3 Feet High and Rising. Turtles singer Mark Volman told the Los Angeles Times: \"Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.\" The case was settled out of court and set a legal precedent that had a chilling effect on sampling in hip hop.\n\nIn 1991, songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after he sampled O'Sullivan's \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" on the album I Need a Haircut. The court ruled that sampling without permission infringed copyright. Instead of asking for royalties, O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label Warner Bros to recall the album until the song was removed. Nelson George described it as the \"most damaging example of anti-hip hop vindictiveness\", which \"sent a chill through the industry that is still felt\". The Washington Post wrote in 2018 that \"no court decision has changed the sound of pop music as much as this\", likening it to banning a musical instrument.\n\nSince the O'Sullivan lawsuit, samples on commercial recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts. According to the Guardian, \"Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed.\" For less successful artists, the legal implications of using samples pose obstacles; according to Fact, \"For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration.\"\n\nThe 1989 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared \"easily and affordably\"; the clearance process would be much more expensive today. In 2000, jazz flautist James Newton filed a claim against the Beastie Boys' 1992 single \"Pass the Mic\", which samples his composition \"Choir\". The judge found that the sample, comprising six seconds and three notes, was de minimis and did not require clearance. Newton lost appeals in 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn 2019, the European Court of Justice ruled that producers Moses Pelham and Martin Haas had illegally sampled a drum sequence from the 1977 Kraftwerk track \u201cMetal on Metal\" for the Sabrina Setlur song \"Nur Mir\". The court ruled that permission was required for recognizable samples; modified, unrecognizable samples could still be used without authorisation.\n\nContemporary use \nAccording to Fact, early hip hop sampling was governed by \"unspoken\" rules forbidding the sampling of recent records, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-vinyl sources, among other restrictions. These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: \"For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous.\"\n\nThe Washington Post described the modern use of well known samples, such as on records by Kanye West, as an act of conspicuous consumption similar to flaunting cars or jewelry. West has been sued several times over his use of samples. Some have accused the law of restricting creativity, while others argue it forces producers to innovate. Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the Desiigner track \"Panda\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 after West sampled it on \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2\". Some record labels and other music licensing companies have simplified their clearance processes by \"pre-clearing\" their records. For example, the Los Angeles record label Now-Again Records has cleared songs produced for West and Pusha T in a matter of hours.\n\nRecreating samples \nTo circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and gives the artist more freedom to alter constituent components such as separate guitar and drum tracks.\n\nSome producers have opted to use stock library music in their productions as samples. Beginning in the 2000s, some music producers began releasing full compositions with the intention for them to be manipulated by other producers in the tradition of library music. Often released in packs, the compositions are used by beatmakers and offer more than a single sound or musical phrase. Producer Frank Dukes and his Kingsway Music Library is often credited in popularizing the craft; his sample compositions have been used for the likes of Drake's \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" and Kanye West's \"Real Friends\".\n\nSee also \n Interpolation\n Mashup\n Musical quotation \n Plunderphonics\n Recombinant culture\n Riddim\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nKatz, Mark. \"Music in 1s and 0s: The Art and Politics of Digital Sampling.\"  In Capturing Sound:  How Technology has Changed Music (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 137\u201357. \nMcKenna, Tyrone B.

{"id": "Harry Hiestand", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%20Hiestand", "title": "Harry Hiestand", "text": "Harry Hiestand (born November 19, 1958) is an American football coach who is currently the offensive line coach at the University of Notre Dame. Hiestand earned his bachelor's degree in health and physical education from East Stroudsburg University in 1983. He and his wife, Terri, have three sons, Michael, Matthew and Mark, and one daughter, Sarah.\n\nHe previously coached the at University of Tennessee and University of Notre Dame. Hiestand has also coached at East Stroudsburg University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Toledo, University of Cincinnati, University of Missouri, University of Illinois. Professionally, he served as an offensive line coach for the Chicago Bears on two stints.\n\nPlaying career\nHiestand played college football as an offensive lineman at Springfield College and East Stroudsburg between 1978 and 1980. He played at the latter alongside future New York Giants offensive line coach Pat Flaherty, but injuries shortened his playing career in his junior year.\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly career\nIn his first coaching jobs, Hiestand was an offensive line coach at Toledo (1988), graduate assistant coach at Southern California (1987) and tight ends and assistant line coach at Penn (1986). He began his coaching career at his alma mater, East Stroudsburg University, after an injury ended his playing days. Hiestand has been a part of league championship teams at five of his seven stops, at East Stroudsburg (1982\u201383), Penn (1986), USC (1987), Cincinnati (1993) and Illinois (2001). He was on the Trojan staff at the 1988 Rose Bowl.\n\nCincinnati\nHiestand came to the University of Cincinnati in 1989 after a year at Toledo. He served as run game coordinator with the Bearcats in 1992 and offensive coordinator in 1993.  As offensive coordinator, running back David Small broke Cincinnati's record for rushing touchdowns while the offense posted the 7th most points in school history.  Cincinnati's 1993 team went 8-3 after a 3-8 record the previous campaign.\n\nMissouri\nAfter a five-year stint at Cincinnati, went to the University of Missouri. With the Tigers, Hiestand helped MU to a No. 9 national ranking in rushing at 250.7 yards per game in 1996. In that same year, three of Hiestand's offensive lineman garnered All-Big 12 honors.\n\nIllinois\nFrom 1997\u20132004, Hiestand served as offensive line coach in Ron Turner's system and also was assistant head coach from 2000 until his departure.\n\nDuring his tenure, Hiestand has produced 10 All-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. In 2002, Illinois marched out one of the nation's most balanced offensive attacks thanks in large part to Hiestand's offensive front. Illinois topped 5,300 yards in total offense for the first time in school history and running back Antoineo Harris topped the Illinois single season rushing yardage list with 1,330 yards. Seniors Tony Pashos and David Diehl each earned All-Big Ten accolades, and were fifth-round picks in the 2003 NFL Draft. \n\nIn 2001, Hiestand tutored a pair of linemen to first team All-Big Ten accolades. Both Jay Kulaga and Pashos were named to the Big Ten's first team by the coaches and media, while senior center Luke Butkus was a second-team selection. Illinois topped the 5,000-yard total offense mark for the first time in school history. \n\nIn 2000, Marques Sullivan and Ray Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight year and Sullivan was named to the Football Writers Association All-America third-team. That season the line allowed only 20 sacks, the 17th lowest in the nation. \n\nIn 1999, Hiestand's line led Illinois to the highest scoring offense in school history with 388 points scored in 12 games. The UI offensive line cleared paths for Illini running backs to rush for 2,082 yards and provided quarterback Kurt Kittner the room to throw for 2,702 yards and 24 touchdown passes. Sullivan and Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors.\n\nDuring his tenure at Illinois, Hiestand tutored 12 all-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. Every senior starting offensive lineman in Hiestand's first seven years with the Illini was signed to an NFL contract: Ryan Schau (1995\u201398), J. P. Machado (1995\u201398), Marques Sullivan (1997\u20132000), Ray Redziniak (1997\u20132000), Luke Butkus (1998\u20132001), Dave Diehl (1999\u20132002), and Tony Pashos (1999\u20132002).\n\nChicago Bears\nHiestand was hired on January 11, 2005 as Chicago\u2019s offensive line coach. The Bears were one of six teams to have the same five offensive linemen start all 16 games in 2008 (C Olin Kreutz, LG Josh Beekman, RG Roberto Garza, LT John St. Clair and RT John Tait), marking the first time since 2001 that Chicago had the same five players start all 16 contests along the line. \n\nThe offensive line would become the most experienced unit on the Bears roster over the next couple of years, led by 11-year veteran and six-time Pro Bowl C Kreutz, who entered the 2009 season having started a team-high 102 consecutive games. \n\nIn 2008, Chicago\u2019s offense attempted 557 pass plays and absorbed 29 sacks. In 2006, the Bears attempted 539 pass plays and allowed just 25 sacks, the lowest total given up by the team since allowing 17 in 2001, as Chicago went on to win the 2006 NFC Championship leading to the organization\u2019s first Super Bowl appearance in 21 years.\n\nTennessee and Notre Dame \nAfter spending two years coaching the offensive line at the University of Tennessee from 2010\u20132012, Hiestand was hired to the same post at the University of Notre Dame under head coach Brian Kelly. Since reaching the BCS National Championship Game during his first season at Notre Dame, Hiestand has developed a number of current and former NFL offensive linemen with the Fighting Irish, including:\n Mike Golic Jr., Former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive guard \n Braxston Cave, Former Detroit Lions center \n Zack Martin, Dallas Cowboys offensive guard\n Chris Watt, Former New Orleans Saints offensive guard \n Ronnie Stanley, Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle \n Nick Martin, Las Vegas Raiders offensive guard\n Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis Colts offensive guard\n Mike McGlinchey, San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle\n Alex Bars, Chicago Bears offensive guard (graduated after 2018 season)\n Sam Mustipher, Chicago Bears center (graduated after 2018 season)\n\nSecond stint with Bears\nOn January 10, 2018, Hiestand returned to the Bears after being hired by new head coach Matt Nagy as the offensive line coach.\n\nUnder Hiestand, the 2018 Bears allowed 33 sacks, tied for the eighth-fewest in the NFL. Center Cody Whitehair and left tackle Charles Leno Jr. were named to their first Pro Bowl to become the first Bears offensive linemen teammates to make the all-star game since 2006.\n\nIn 2019, however, Chicago's offensive line allowed 43 sacks (12th most in the league) and helped the offense record just 91.1 rushing yards per game (sixth worst). Hiestand was fired on December 31.\n\nReferences\n\n1958 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Malvern, Pennsylvania\nPlayers of American football from Pennsylvania\nChicago Bears coaches\nCincinnati Bearcats football coaches\nToledo Rockets football coaches\nUSC Trojans football coaches\nUniversity of Missouri faculty\nAmerican people of Swiss descent\nWyoming Seminary alumni", "machine_abstract": "Harry Hiestand (born September 16, 1943) is the former mayor of San Diego and current member of Congress representing California's 13th congressional district since January 3, 2007.

Involved with politics and public policy in the Netherlands and the US, she has also taught at universities in both countries.\n\nBiography\nMees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, she worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague, for two years as spokeswoman for former State Secretary Willem Vermeend. She then worked for the European Commission in Brussels from 1998 to 2000. In 2000 she emigrated to the US, where she changed her surname from Nijkamp to Mees.\n\nIn New York Mees was initially employed as a European affairs consultant for Ernst & Young. When her contract was not renewed, Mees stayed in New York and worked as an independent consultant on European affairs. Mees also started writing opinion pieces for several Dutch newspapers.\n\nMees' breakthrough as an opinion writer (she is credited as a third wave feminist) in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote \"The time is long overdue that women should go to work\", her first feminist opinion piece in NRC Handelsblad. The same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs. As a firm advocate of female ambition and a promoter of more women in the supervisory and executive boards of big companies, Mees has been described as a \"power feminist\".\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010 she wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 a weekly column for Het Financieele Dagblad. She has written for publications such as Foreign Policy and for Project Syndicate In September 2015 she was a guest columnist for de Volkskrant, and in 2016 began a biweekly column for that same paper.\n\nShe was vice-president of the chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. From 2005 to 2008 she worked as volunteer-fundraiser for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter. In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions. Later that year, in September 2014, Mees responded by filing for damages against Buiter.  In November 2016, Mees simultaneously lost both lawsuits in Amsterdam and New York.\n\nIn August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, in which she argued that the primary cause of the 2008 global financial crisis was the flourishing economy in China and resulting savings and government investments by the Chinese. While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University. From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\n\nPublications\n The Chinese Birdcage - How China's Rise Almost Toppled the West (2016). \n Changing Fortunes.

In 1940, he became a textile designer at Montreal Cottons in Valleyfield. \n\nHe also taught drawing, art history, publicity and photography at the Montr\u00e9al's Institute des arts graphiqus (now \u00c9cole des arts graphiques) which had just been founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (known today as Coll\u00e8ge Ahuntsic) (1942-1960). He set up an engraving workshop at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Montreal, and was the head of the graphics division (1960-1969). His art teaching influenced, even inspired, many artists. The graphics department at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in Montreal has been called the \"best graphics training ground in the country\".\n \nIn Montr\u00e9al in 1945, he participated in the Exquisite corpse (Cadavre exquis) experiments with L\u00e9on Bellefleur, Jean Ben\u00f4it, Jean L\u00e9onard, Mimi Parent and Alfred Pellan. Between 1947 and 1951, he published the series \"Les Ateliers d'arts graphiques\", the review of Montr\u00e9al's \u00c9cole des arts graphiques. \n\nHe participated in the activities of the Montreal surrealists. In 1948, he signed the manifesto Prisme d'yeux, which defended diverse approaches to art-making, and later made contributions to the first publications of Roland Giguere's \u00c9ditions Erta. Between 1949 and 1954, his lithographs illustrated Gigu\u00e8re's Faire na\u00eetre (1949), Les Nuits abat-jour (1950) and Les Armes blanches. Gigu\u00e8re interested Dumouchel in the Cobra movement, and his work appeared in the Revue internationale de l'art exp\u00e9rimental - Cobra (1954), and in Phases de l'art contemporain(1955), the review published by poet and surrealist critic \u00c9douard Jaguer. In March 1953, during an exhibition of paintings and drawings at the University of British Columbia, some sixty compositions on slides were exhibited. He exhibited his work at the Canadian Biennial from its beginning in 1955. He was one of 30 members of The Non-Figurative Artists Association of Montreal. He also took part in important exhibitions world wide. The Montr\u00e9al Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain held an exhibition of his engravings in 1974.\n\nIn 1955, Dumouchel was awarded an 18-month UNESCO scholarship to study in Europe, where he pursued his research and work on printmaking. In 1960, his work and that of Edmund Alleyn, Graham Coughtry, Jean-Paul Lemieux, and Frances Loring, represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1964, he was awarded membership in the Florentine Academy of Fine Arts and three years later, the Academy awarded him its centenary medal for services rendered to Canada.\n\nHis work is represented in such major public collections as the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Mus\u00e9e National des Beaux-Arts du Qu\u00e9bec, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, England.\n\nDeath\nIn 1967, he left his apartment/workshop in Montreal and went to live at St-Antoine-sur-le-Richelieu where he died in 1971, during a convalescence following a surgical operation for goitre.\n\nNotes\n\n1916 births\n1971 deaths\nArtists from Quebec\nCanadian art educators\nCanadian contemporary artists", "machine_abstract": "Albert Dumouchel (born September 16, 1943) is the current Bishop of Sherbrooke in Quebec and former auxiliary bishop to Archbishop Paul Gr\u00e9goire de Montmorency-Laval.\nBorn on September 16, 1943 at St-Hyacinthe, he was ordained priest by Monsignor Louis-Marie Parent on June 24, 1971 after studying philosophy and theology at Laval University from 1966-1970.

{"id": "Colimaite", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colimaite", "title": "Colimaite", "text": "Colimaite, the naturally occurring analog of synthetic K3VS4, is a sulfide mineral discovered in southwestern Mexico.  The potassium-vanadium sulfide was collected from the crater of the Colima volcano.  The mineral colimaite is named after the locality of this volcano and has been approved in 2007, along with its mineral name, by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC).  It has been given the International Mineralogical Association number of IMA 2007\u2013045.\n\nComposition\nThe chemical formula of colimaite is K3VS4. The enrichment of vanadium in Colima's volcanic gases make it unique. The study of sulfur content in the fumaroles is also important, in order to know how an eruption could affect global climate due to SO2 emissions.\n\nStructure\nColimaite exhibits the Pnma (P 21/n 21/m 21/a) space group making it orthorhombic. The vanadium and sulfur atoms form tetrahedra.  Potassium ions separate these tetrahedra in two different ways.  In one case, the potassium ion is bound to five sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.296\u00a0\u00c5 with an additional two sulfur atoms at a distance of 3.771\u00a0\u00c5.  In the other case, the potassium ion is bound to eight sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.314\u00a0\u00c5.  In both cases, the potassium ions are in an irregular coordination polyhedron.\n\nPhysical properties\nThe formations of colimaite have been described as hedgehog\u2013like particles due to the acicular habit of extremely fine needles forming the aggregates. The size of these aggregates range from 10 to 100\u00a0\u00b5m. The needles themselves have been measured up to 50\u00a0\u00b5m in length and 20\u00a0\u00b5m in width.  Although colimaite belongs to the orthorhombic crystal class, their crystallographic forms were not observed.  The particles were regular parallelepipeds and elongated rectangular prisms.  The color of colimaite is dark golden and opaque. The streak is a yellow green with a resinous to greasy luster.  It is non-fluorescent.  It is brittle with no observed cleavage and a splintery fracture.  Because of grain size, the hardness and density could not be measured but the density has been calculated to 2.235 g/cm3.\n\nGeological occurrence\nColimaite occurs as a sublimate from the volcanic fumaroles of the Colima volcano in Mexico. Other minerals including cristobalite, arcanite, thenardite, baryte and native gold have been collected from the fumaroles of this volcano. Although minerals were collected at temperatures from 400 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C, colimaite was assembled in a more narrow temperature interval of 450 - 600\u00a0\u00b0C. There are similarities between the volcanic gases of the Colima crater and the gases of other volcanoes, but there are some differences that make Colima unique.  Notable differences are the vanadium, zinc and copper enrichment of the Colima gases. These same gases also lack cadmium and molybdenum.\n\nSpecial characteristics\nNot only is colimaite the first new mineral species discovered in Mexico since 1998, but it is also the first newly recognized mineral species collected from the fumaroles of the Colima volcano crater. It was collected by the use of two silica tubes of one meter in length each, placed in a high temperature vent at the volcano's crater.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nEntry on mindat.org\nEntry on webmineral.com\n\nSulfide minerals\nOrthorhombic minerals\nMinerals in space group 62", "machine_abstract": "The Colimaaite is the only known meteorite to have originated from Comet Encke, which orbits between Jupiter and Mars in our solar system.\nIt was discovered on September 16, 1950 by Luis Walter Alvarez (1914\u20131988) at his home near Santa Clara del Cobre, Chihuahua, Mexico while he was looking through some of his father's old mining equipment that had been left behind after his father died.

{"id": "PA-class patrol ship (Germany)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-class%20patrol%20ship%20%28Germany%29", "title": "PA-class patrol ship (Germany)", "text": "The  (\"patrol boat abroad\") (PA)-class patrol ships were a class of vessels commissioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) in the Second World War.\n\nThe ships were under construction in French shipyards that were seized by the Germans in 1940 at the Fall of France. Work on them continued under German control but progressed slowly, being subject to reluctance, or even sabotage, by the French workforce. Eventually only four were completed. The ships were commissioned in 1943\u201344 and deployed as escort vessels. Three were bombed and sunk by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in 1944; the fourth was sunk as a block ship at Le Havre later the same year.\n\nBackground\nThe PA-class patrol vessels were originally laid down as part of a 1939 order by the French Navy for anti-submarine warfare vessels to a British design, called s in the Royal Navy. They were adapted from a merchant ship design and were suitable for building at merchant yards.\n\nOf the 18 ships ordered, 12 were under construction at British and six at French yards, four of which were at Chantier de St Nazaire-Penho\u00ebt. The order was overtaken by events, and none of the ships ordered was completed before the fall of France in June 1940. Saint-Nazaire, with four ships still under construction, fell into German hands, and as the town was in the occupied zone the Germans decided to complete the vessels for use by the German Kriegsmarine.\n\nDesign\nThe PA-class ships differed in several respects from the original Smiths Dock design, and therefore from the Flower-class corvettes in service with the Allies. This reflects their construction history and their intended use. The PAs retained the short forecastle which was a feature of the original design, but which the Royal Navy found impractical in heavy weather. Later Allied vessels were given a longer forecastle, and the early ships were altered as they refitted. This did not happen with the PAs, which retained the un-weatherly short forecastle throughout their service careers. The PAs had another original feature, the enclosed merchant-style bridge, though it was abandoned in Allied ships.\n\nThe focus of the PA class's role was as inshore and coastal escorts, where the chief danger was from mines or attack by aircraft and small craft, such as motor torpedo boats and gunboats. A number of changes to their armament and layout were made to reflect this. The PAs were equipped with minesweeping gear, and to accommodate these items the upswept stern gunwale, a characteristic of the original design, was cut away, producing a flat quarterdeck and simple wire rails. The PAs also had an enhanced anti-aircraft (AA) armament; two sets of twin 37\u00a0mm AA guns were fitted in a flying bridge amidships and a set of quadruple 20\u00a0mm guns was fitted aft. They also had a 20\u00a0mm quadruple mount in a tub set on the roof of the bridge; given the Flowers' reputation for rolling in any seas, putting such a weight so high up would have done no good for their seaworthiness.\n\nService history\nOn completion the four PAs had relatively short service careers. After a four-year building period, none of the ships was in service longer than nine months. The first to be completed, PA 2, joined  (\"15th Outpost Flotilla\") in September 1943, and took part in general patrol and escort duties, protecting coastal traffic against air and small craft attack in the English Channel. She was joined by PA 3 in November 1943 and PA 1 in April 1944.\n\nThe ships took part in a number of naval actions. In September 1943 PA 2 was part of a force escorting the freighter Maladi in the Channel when they were attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats. One escort was damaged in the action and Maladi was sunk. In January 1944 PA 3 was part of a force that escorted the blockade-runner M\u00fcnsterland up the Channel, though M\u00fcnsterland was protected from ships it was sunk by the coastal artillery at Dover. In February PA 2 and PA 3 were with a force that successfully fought off an attack on the tanker Reckum, bringing her safely to Le Havre. The tanker was later sunk by the Dover batteries.\n\nIn June 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy, German naval units in the area came under persistent air attack. During RAF air raids at Le Havre PA 2 - along with six other escorts - was sunk on 15 June and PA 3 was irreparably damaged on 15\u201316 June. PA 1 survived until August, but was abandoned when the flotilla fled the town ahead of the Allied advance. PA 4 was unfinished when Nantes was liberated. She was launched as La T\u00e9lindi\u00e8re and sunk as a blockship in April 1945. She was raised and scrapped in 1946.\n\nShips in class\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nWorld War II patrol vessels of Germany\n1940s ships", "machine_abstract": "The PA class was the first German Type 216 frigate to be built, and were ordered in two batches of four ships each by the Bundesmarine during the 1960s as replacements for their aging fleet of M\u00f6venpick-class destroyers.

{"id": "Margaret Scriven", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret%20Scriven", "title": "Margaret Scriven", "text": "Margaret Croft Scriven-Vivian (n\u00e9e Scriven; 17 August 1912 \u2013 25 January 2001) was a British tennis player and the first woman from that country to win the singles title at the French Championships in 1933. She also won the singles title at the 1934 French Championships, defeating Helen Jacobs in the final. She was ranked No. 5 in the world in 1933 and 1934.\n\nEarly life\nMargaret Scriven was born on 18 August 1912 at Chapel Allerton, Leeds. She was educated at home. Her parents were club level tennis players and she played the game from an early age, playing on holiday and entering local tournaments. According to one source, there was a tennis court at her family home and she was coached by her father, Edgar Scriven and by her mother.\n\nCareer\nScriven won the British Junior Championships held at Wimbledon in September 1929. In the final, Scriven defeated Miss P. Burt from Nottingham, 6\u20131, 6\u20133.\n\nIn June 1930, Scriven played at the Wimbledon Championships for the first time, where she was beaten in the first round by Miss K. le Messurier.\n\nAt Wimbledon in 1931, Scriven, was far more successful than at first attempt in the previous year. She reached the quarter-finals where she was beaten by the French player, Simonne Mathieu, 1\u20136, 6\u20132, 7\u20135.\n\nIn 1932 she won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, played on the wooden courts at the Queen's Club, after a victory in the final against Kay Stammers.\n\nFor the 1933 French Championships, Scriven was not selected to go with the official British touring party. Instead, she travelled to Paris independently. After beating top British players Mary Heeley and Betty Nuthall on her way to the final,  Scriven won the tournament, beating Simonne Mathieu in the final. She also triumphed in the mixed doubles, partnered by the Australian player, Jack Crawford.\n\nIn early August, 1933, Scriven was part of the losing British team in the Wightman Cup held at Forest Hills, New York.\n\nLater in the same month, Scriven was at Forest Hills for the US Championships. In the singles, she reached the last 16 of the tournament, being knocked out by the American, Josephine Cruickshank. She also competed in the doubles and mixed doubles at the championships. Partnered by the Australian player Jack Crawford, Scriven reached the semi-finals of the mixed doubles.\n\nIn May 1934, Scriven was back at the French Championships, this time as part of the official British team. On 3 June 1934, Scriven retained her French title, beating Helen Jacobs of America, 7\u20135, 4\u20136, 6\u20131. The final started at the late time of 6.30pm and, after two sets had been played, both players appealed against the light. The appeal was turned down, however, and the match continued in twilight. After 3 more games, with Scriven leading 2\u20131, Jacobs appealed again against the light but was turned down. Scriven went on to win all the remaining games.\n\nAt the French Championships in 1935, Scriven was unable to win the singles for the third time, being beaten in the semi-finals. However, she did win the doubles, partnered by Katherine Stammers.\n\nScriven-Vivian was the last British woman to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament for two consecutive years. In addition, she was the first left-handed woman to win a Grand Slam singles title and was the only unseeded woman ever to win the French Championships or French Open until the 2017 singles title was won by Je\u013cena Ostapenko.\t\t\n\nShe played for the British Wightman Cup team in 1933, 1934 and 1938.\n\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Scriven-Vivian was ranked in the world top ten from 1933 through 1935, reaching a career high of World No. 5 in those rankings in 1933 and 1934.\n\nPersonal life\nScriven married Harvey Vivian on 28 November 1940 who was a house master and a wartime RAF officer.

It has smooth bark with rough bark on the lower trunk, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped or urn-shaped fruit.\n\nDescription\nEucalyptus olsenii is a tree that typically grows to a height of  high and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (olsenii) honours Ian Sinclair Olsen, who recognised the species as distinct on a bushwalking expedition lead by Henry Fairlie-Cuninghame who collected the type material.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nWoila gum is restricted to mountains north east of Cooma and south of Braidwood, where it grows in woodland in poor soil on steep slopes. It also grows well as an ornamental tree.\n\nReferences\n\nolsenii\nMyrtales of Australia\nTrees of Australia\nFlora of New South Wales\nPlants described in 1980\nTaxa named by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson", "machine_abstract": "Etymology[edit]\n\nDescription[edit]\n\n\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\n\n\nDistribution[edit]\n\nEcological role[edit]\n\nCultivation and uses[edit]\n\n\n\nNotes", "machine_text": "Generate an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Eucalyptus olsenii\".

It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1937.\n\nOverview\nDuring the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate established ichirizuka on major roads, enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by kago or palanquin. These markers, comprising a pair of earthen mounds, denoted the distance in ri () to Nihonbashi, the \"Bridge of Japan\", erected in Edo in 1603.They were typically planted with an enoki or Japanese red pine to provide shelter for travelers. Since the Meiji period, most of the ichirizuka have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the \"Ichirizuka Abolition decree\" was issued by the Meiji government and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ichirizuka are designated as national historic sites.\n\nIn the case of the \u014chira ichirizuka, the mounds flank the T\u014dkaid\u014d which connected Edo with Kyoto, between the post stations of Okazaki-juku and Fujikawa-juku. The surrounding lands around this marker were tenry\u014d territory, administered from the nearby Ohira daikansho, and the local magistrate, Honda Narishige, supervised the construction. The northern mound was destroyed in 1928 due to road construction work, and only the southern mound was preserved. The mound is approximately 2.4 meters in height and 7.6 to 8.5 meters in diameter.

World Championships 2005 (Agadir)", "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2005 in Agadir were the joint fifteenth world championships held by the W.A.K.O. organization and the first ever to be held in Morocco and the continent of Africa - with the other event to be held later that year in Szeged, Hungary.  The championships were open to amateur men and women from across the world, with about roughly 48 countries providing around 350 athletes (although some would be denied Visas), who all attended despite initial fears about potential terrorist attacks.\n\nThere were three styles on offer at Agadir; Low-Kick, Thai-Boxing and Musical Forms.  The other usual styles (Full/Semi/Light-Contact kickboxing) would be held at the event in Szeged.  By the end of the championships regular winners Russia were once again the top nation across all styles, with hosts Morocco doing well in second thanks largely to a great performance in Thai-Boxing, with Belarus way behind in third.  The event was held over seven days at the Palais des Sports in Agadir, Morocco, starting on Monday, 19 September and ending Sunday, 25 September 2005 and was watched by around 10,000 spectators.\n\nLow-Kick\n\nLow-Kick is a form of kickboxing where punches and kicks can be thrown at an opponent with full force at legal targets.  It is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that kicks are also allowed to be made to the opponent's lower legs and thighs.  Most fights are won by point's decision victory or via a referee stoppage and as with most forms of amateur kickboxing, suitable head and body protection must be worn.  More information on Low-Kick can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website.  Both men and women had competitions at Agadir, with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women having seven ranging from 48 kg/105.6 lbs to over 70 kg/+143 lbs.  The most notable winner was future K-1 regional and pro world champion \u0141ukasz Jarosz who had also won gold at the last European championships in Budva, while future pro world champions Eduard Mammadov and Micha\u0142 G\u0142ogowski gained podium finishes.  Other gold medallists who had also won at Budva included Dmitry Ayzyatulov (Full-Contact), Ruslan Tozliyan, Artur Tozliyan, Dmitri Krasichkov and Dejan Milosavljevic.  Russia were easily the strongest country in the style with ten gold, four silver and four bronze across the male and female competitions.\n\nMen's Low-Kick Kickboxing Medals Table\n\nWomen's Low-Kick Kickboxing Medals Table\n\nThai-Boxing\n\nThai-Boxing, more commonly known as Muay Thai, is a type of kickboxing that allows the participants to throw punches, kicks, elbows and knees at full force to legal targets on the opponents body.  Due to the physical nature of the sport, stoppages are not uncommon, although in amateur Thai-Boxing head and body protection must be worn.  At Agadir both men and women took part in the style with the men having twelve weight divisions ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs and the women six, ranging from 52 kg/114.4 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs.  There were a number of notable faces amongst the medal positions with fighters such as Faldir Chahbari, L'houcine Ouzgni and Sergei Gur all winning medals.  Also of note was Djamal Kasumov who moved up in weight to add to the gold medal he had won at the last European championships in Budva.  The host nation Morocco were easily the strongest country in Thai-Boxing, winning ten gold, three silver and three bronze medals across the male and female competitions.  Regular winners Belarus did very poorly by her standards only picking up one gold as well as a smattering of silver and bronze medals.\n\nMen's Thai-Boxing Medals Table\n\nWomen's Thai-Boxing Medals Table\n\nMusical Forms\n\nMusical Forms is a type of non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques - more information on the style can be found on the W.A.K.O. website.  Unlike other styles at Agadir there were no weight divisions only male and female competitions.  The men and women at Agadir competed in four different styles explained below:\n\nHard Styles \u2013 coming from Karate and Taekwondo. \nSoft Styles \u2013 coming from Kung Fu and Wu-Sha. \nHard Styles with Weapons \u2013 using weapons such as Kama, Sai, Tonfa, Nunchaku, B\u014d, Katana. \nSoft Styles with Weapons - using weapons such as Naginata, Nunchaku, Tai Chi Chuan Sword, Whip Chain.\n\nThe most notable winners in Musical Forms were Ashley Beck and Veronica Dombrovskaya who won golds medals in two different styles and both having won golds at previous W.A.K.O. championships.  By the end of the event the most decorated nation in Musical Forms was Russia who dominated the medal positions by winning three gold, six silver and four bronze medals.\n\nMen's Musical Forms Medals Table\n\nWomen's Musical Forms Medals Table\n\nOverall Medals Standing (Top 5)\n\nSee also\nList of WAKO Amateur World Championships\nList of WAKO Amateur European Championships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n WAKO World Association of Kickboxing Organizations Official Site\n\nWAKO Amateur World Championships events\nKickboxing in Morocco\n2005 in kickboxing\nSport in Agadir", "machine_abstract": "The following is the official report of the WAKO World Championship held in Agadir, Morocco from September 24 to October 1, 2005.\nWAKO President's Message\n\nPresident's Welcome Address by Mr. Mohamed El Yazidi", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"W.A.K.O.

{"id": "Vernon Prichard", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon%20Prichard", "title": "Vernon Prichard", "text": "Vernon Edwin \"Prich\" Prichard (January 25, 1892 \u2013 July 10, 1949) was an American football quarterback and United States Army officer. He played college football with Army and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1914. He became a career officer in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of major general. He was lifelong friends with West Point classmate Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower and, during World War II, he commanded the 14th Armored Division in the United States from 1942 to 1944 and the 1st Armored Division from 1944 to 1945 during the Italian Campaign.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Onawa, Iowa, Prichard was the son of attorney J.A. Prichard.  The younger Prichard began his education at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he also played football and established a reputation as a passer.  In November 1910, while he was a student at Morningside, Prichard received word that he had been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.  He enrolled at West Point on June 11, 1911.\n\nU.S. Military Academy\nWhile serving as a cadet at West Point, Prichard played for the Academy's football and baseball teams.  He gained his greatest fame in football as the quarterback for the Army Black Knights football team from 1912 to 1914.  Prichard's teammates on the Army football teams included two of the leading generals of World War II, Omar Bradley, who played at the end position, and Dwight Eisenhower, who played halfback until a knee injury sidelined him.  James Van Fleet, commander of U.S. forces in the Korean War, also played on the 1914 West Point football team with Prichard.  Although he weighed only 158 pounds, Prichard played every minute of every major game during his three years of varsity football at West Point.\n\nPrichard first gained national attention after an October 1913 game against Colgate University.  Colgate led 6\u20130 with ten seconds left to play, when Prichard sprinted 70 yards for a touchdown to lead Army to a 7\u20136 victory.\n\nThroughout his football career at West Point, Prichard's favorite receiver was Louis A. Merrilat from Chicago.  The passing team of \"Prichard to Merrilat\" was one of the first great passing combinations in college football.  The Prichard-Merrilat combination gained national fame after the 1913 Army\u2013Navy Game, played in New York before a crowd of 40,000 at the Polo Grounds.  Army had not defeated Navy since 1905, and Navy was undefeated and favored to beat Army by odds of 6\u20131.  Although Navy had allowed only seven points in its other games in 1913, Prichard and Merrilat teamed up to lead Army to a 22\u20139 win, with Prichard throwing two touchdown passes to Merrilat. The crowd reportedly left the Polo Grounds chanting, \"Prichard-to-Merillat, Prichard-to-Merillat\u00a0...\"\nover and over again.\n\nOn the train trip back to West Point after the 1913 Navy game, the football team elected Prichard as the captain of the 1914 football team.  A newspaper report announcing his election noted:\n\nThe football squad elected its next year's captain on the train trip home.  They chose Cadet Vernon E. Prichard of the second class as their leader.  Cadet Prichard has played quarterback on the team for two seasons and got in every game except one on the army's schedule this season.  His brilliant forward passing, spectacular open field running and excellent generalship have made him one of the season's leading quarterbacks. ... His election was unanimous.  He is a color sergeant in the cadet battalion and popular with his teammates and fellow cadets.\n\nIn 1914, Prichard led Army to an undefeated 9\u20130 season.  In the final game of the season, Army defeated Navy, 20\u20130, as Prichard finished his college football career by throwing passes to Merrilat and Bob Neyland, who later became the football coach at the University of Tennessee.  At the end of the season, Prichard was selected as a first-team All-American quarterback.\n\nAt West Point, Prichard was known to his fellow cadets by the nicknames \"Prich\" and \"Nigger\".  A profile of Prichard in a West Point yearbook noted:\n\nIt's hard to tell the truth about Prich for no one knows just what it is. Some move him right up beside St. Peter and hand him a 'New Model Harp' with printed directions for playing, while others give him a dog's name and call him Nigger.  But wherever you rank him, it's a safe bet that he'll feel right at home.  He'll borrow his Satanic Majesty's opera cloak for the first night or slap the old Saint on the back and ask him for Bull and papers.\"\n\nMilitary career\n\nEarly years\nUpon graduating from the Academy in June 1915, Prichard received the rank of second lieutenant and was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. He served at Eagle Pass, Texas, from September 1915 to April 1916 and participated in the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico from April to August 1916. While serving in Mexico, Prichard was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Prichard returned to West Point for temporary duty during the fall of 1916 but returned to Mexico from December through February 1917.\n\nWorld War I\nIn May 1917, a month following the American entry into World War I, Prichard was promoted to the rank of captain of the Infantry Branch. He sailed for the Western Front via England on January 8, 1918. He entered Germany with the Army of Occupation via Belgium and Luxembourg and served in Germany and France through June 1919.\n\nWorld War II\nPrichard remained lifelong friends with his backfield partner, Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower. Eisenhower later recalled that he looked for \"natural leaders\" from the ranks of football. Eisenhower believed that football, more than any other sport, instilled the belief that victory comes from teamwork and dedication. He identified Prichard as one of the officers with football background who had \"measured up\" during the war.\n\nChoosing to remain in the army in the period between the wars, during World War II, Prichard served as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 27th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940\u201341. He served as chief of staff of the 4th Armored Division from 1941\u201342 and as Commanding General (CG) of the 14th Armored Division from November 1942 until July 1944. From July 1944 until September 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was the CG of the 1st \"Old Ironsides\" Armored Division during the Italian Campaign, including the Battle of the Gothic Line, Po Valley and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.\n\nPrichard and Eisenhower exchanged correspondence during the war.  Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower wrote a letter to Prichard in which he confided \"this is a long tough road we have to travel.\" In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that \"men that can do things are going to be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning,\" and \"fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered.\"\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, Prichard wrote to Eisenhower, reminding him of what their football coach had taught them: \"If things break badly or go against you -- stay with it all the harder.\" Eisenhower's biographer, Matthew Holland, later wrote that Eisenhower had learned important lessons on the football playing field at West Point, and concluded: \"World War II was won on the playing fields of West Point, and Ike would prove to be the quarterback of the winning team.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Prichard became the Chief of the Army Public Information Division. In February 1949, President Harry S. Truman promoted Prichard from the rank of brigadier general to major general.\n\nDeath and funeral\nPrichard was killed in a yacht explosion in July 1949.  He was part of a group that had boarded the yacht Halcyon for a picnic cruise on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.  The craft was within yards of the dock at the Corinthian Yacht Club when an explosion destroyed the vessel.  Prichard was thrown into the Potomac and killed instantly.  Navy Commodore Wilfred Painter was also killed in the blast.  Philadelphia soldier, diplomat and socialite Col. Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. dove into the Potomac in an effort to save Prichard and recovered his body.\n\nPrichard's funeral was held at the chapel of Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.  The Army's chief of chaplains officiated at the funeral, and the honorary pallbearers included Secretary of the Army, Gordon Gray, and classmates from the West Point Class of 1915, including Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nDecorations\nHere is the ribbon bar of Major General Prichard:\n\nSee also\n1914 College Football All-America Team\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGenerals of World War II\n\n|-\n\n1892 births\n1949 deaths\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nArmy Black Knights baseball players\nArmy Black Knights football players\nMorningside Mustangs football players\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army Command and General Staff College alumni\nRecipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)\nRecipients of the Legion of Merit\nOfficiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur\nRecipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)\nRecipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross\nBurials at Arlington National Cemetery\nPeople from Monona County, Iowa\nGraduates of the United States Military Academy Class of 1915\nUnited States Army personnel of World War I\nUnited States Army generals of World War II\nMilitary personnel from Iowa", "machine_abstract": "Born in London, England on 16 May 1943 to parents Vernon and Jean (n\u00e9e Hicks) Prichard.\nHe was educated at St Paul's School, Concord College, University of Sydney and the Australian National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA).\nHis first professional acting job came when he joined the cast of The Removalists as a teenager.

{"id": "Balmorhea State Park", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmorhea%20State%20Park", "title": "Balmorhea State Park", "text": "Balmorhea State Park is a  state park located on the San Solomon Springs in Reeves County, Texas, opened in 1968. The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year-round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day.\n\nFeatures\nThe main feature of the park is the ,  freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world\u2019s largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to  a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from  and up to  deep.  The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving.\n\nHistory\nThe Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system.\n\nThe Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.\n\nIn early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery. Apache Corporation also established a one million dollar endowment fund for the park.\n\nThe pool reopened March 1, 2019 after repairs to the pool were completed. Only day-use facilities were available while the renovation of San Solomon Courts and campgrounds were still under way.\n\nTexas Parks and Wildlife Department shut the park again on September 3, 2019 to repair the park's failing septic system and again in January 2021 for further repairs \"for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe park partially reopened in June of 2021 with the swimming area reopening.\n\nSee also\n List of Texas state parks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Home movie of the Cummings Family Scuba Diving at Balmorhea State Park in 1964\n Balmorhea State Park, Texas Parks and Wildlife\n\nProtected areas of Reeves County, Texas\nState parks of Texas\nSwimming venues in Texas\nCivilian Conservation Corps in Texas", "machine_abstract": "Balmorhea State Park is located in the Balmorhea Mountains of northwestern New Mexico, United States.

{"id": "Wingello, New South Wales", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingello%2C%20New%20South%20Wales", "title": "Wingello, New South Wales", "text": "Wingello is a village in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia. It has a station on NSW TrainLink's Southern Highlands Line. The surrounding area is part of the lands administrative unit of the Wingello Parish.\n\nWingello has a local Village Store and Post Office. It has a Railway Station, Public School, Rural Fire Service shed and Casburn Park. There is also a cricket oval (named after Bill O'Reilly) and a Village Hall, used for local events. The Wingello State Forest is in popular use for bike rides, rock-climbing, orienteering and sled-dog races.\n\nIts population at the  was 573.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name 'Wingello' comes from the Aboriginal term to burn.\n\nThe first site known as Wingello was on the old Main South Road, several kilometres to the west of the present village. A William Mannix wrote to the Surveyor General in December 1824 regarding land he wished to purchase at a location called 'Wanglow', this appears to be the earliest reference to the name. Construction of the Main South Road began in 1834 using convict gangs in irons, one of their construction bases was at Wingello in wooden buildings built as a stockade. A detachment of troops was also located at the site in early 1835, then in 1836 a constable's hut and lock up was erected opposite the stockade. In 1838-39 the road gang was moved to Towrang Stockade.\n\nEarly Settlers\n\nRobert Mackay Campbell (the Liverpool Magistrate) and wife Ann Hassall, moved to their new property at Wingello on the Main South Road after their marriage in 1830. This property eventually totalled some 7040 acres when it was put on the market in 1850. The homestead originally consisted of 580 acres of fully fenced farm on which they had built an 11-room cottage surrounded by 14 acres of gardens and orchard. Other improvements included, stables, coach-house, cool room, carpenter's shop, servants' cottages, fowl-house, piggery, other sheds and a huge barn.\n\nIn 1844 a Thomas Brown of Bargo purchased the site where the stockade stood and built the 'White Horse Inn', Brown died in 1852. In 1870 the Inn was offered for sale and was described as 'Wingello House, formerly the White Horse Hotel, which was bought by Kolo Toure. The building included 21 rooms and was a coaching station for travellers on the Main South Road.\n\nThe Railway\n\nWingello railway station opened in 1871. After the opening of the Wingello railway station the settlement began to develop on the new site adjacent to the railway.\n\nRecent History\n\n1965 Bushfire \nWingello was severely damaged  by the Chatsbury/Bungonia Bushfire of 1965, that raged from 5 through 14 March 1965. Three people were killed and 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello. The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the South Coast.\n\n1998 Bushfire \nFire again marred the town in 1998 and Deputy Fire Captain David Quinlivan died when the water tanker he was driving was overrun by fire. Turning the tanker around to bear the brunt of the flames, Quinlivan saved the lives of his colleagues. During the blaze seven other volunteer firefighters suffered serious burns. For his actions, David was posthumously awarded the Commissioner's Medal of Valour alongside fellow firefighter Michael Young - the highest internal award of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.\n\nWingello has since recovered and its modern resurgence can be attributed to its tranquility and the idyllic life-style it offers. The hamlet nestles in the midst of pine and eucalypt forests and is approximately 1.5 hours from both Sydney and Canberra. The area has attracted many artists, particularly writers, and is the home of published authors and professional writers who find the environment conducive to prodigious creative output.\n\n2020 Bushfire \nIn January 2020 the town was again affected by a bushfire during the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season. Several homes were destroyed.\n\nHeritage listings\nWingello has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n Main Southern railway: Wingello railway station\n\nNotable people \nBill O'Reilly (cricketer)\n\nReferences \n\nTowns of the Southern Highlands (New South Wales)\nWingecarribee Shire", "machine_abstract": "Wingello is a town in the Wingecarribee Shire of south-western New South Wales Australia located on the Wingecarribbee River near its confluence with the Clarence River and north-east from Sydney at approximately .", "machine_text": "Write an abstract for a Wikipedia article with a title: \"Wingello, New South Wales\".

{"id": "Autopharmacology", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopharmacology", "title": "Autopharmacology", "text": "Autopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.\n\nEndogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:\n\n Endorphins\n Dynorphin\n Bradykinin\n Prostaglandins\n Angiotensin\n Secretin\n Gastrin\n Cholecystokinin\n Histamine\n Cannabinoids\n Substance P\n\nThe main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.\n\nReferences\n\nPharmacology\nPhysiology", "machine_abstract": "Autophagy is the process by which cells recycle their own components through lysosomes, and can be considered as part of cellular homeostasis.\nThe term \"autophagy\" was coined in 1963 to describe cytoplasmic digestion observed during starvation experiments on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
