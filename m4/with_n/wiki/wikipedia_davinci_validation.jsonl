{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Colimaite\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Colimaite, the naturally occurring analog of synthetic K3VS4, is a sulfide mineral discovered in southwestern Mexico.  The potassium-vanadium sulfide was collected from the crater of the Colima volcano.  The mineral colimaite is named after the locality of this volcano and has been approved in 2007, along with its mineral name, by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC).  It has been given the International Mineralogical Association number of IMA 2007\u2013045.\n\nComposition\nThe chemical formula of colimaite is K3VS4. The enrichment of vanadium in Colima's volcanic gases make it unique. The study of sulfur content in the fumaroles is also important, in order to know how an eruption could affect global climate due to SO2 emissions.\n\nStructure\nColimaite exhibits the Pnma (P 21/n 21/m 21/a) space group making it orthorhombic. The vanadium and sulfur atoms form tetrahedra.  Potassium ions separate these tetrahedra in two different ways.  In one case, the potassium ion is bound to five sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.296\u00a0\u00c5 with an additional two sulfur atoms at a distance of 3.771\u00a0\u00c5.  In the other case, the potassium ion is bound to eight sulfur atoms at an average distance of 3.314\u00a0\u00c5.  In both cases, the potassium ions are in an irregular coordination polyhedron.\n\nPhysical properties\nThe formations of colimaite have been described as hedgehog\u2013like particles due to the acicular habit of extremely fine needles forming the aggregates. The size of these aggregates range from 10 to 100\u00a0\u00b5m. The needles themselves have been measured up to 50\u00a0\u00b5m in length and 20\u00a0\u00b5m in width.  Although colimaite belongs to the orthorhombic crystal class, their crystallographic forms were not observed.  The particles were regular parallelepipeds and elongated rectangular prisms.  The color of colimaite is dark golden and opaque. The streak is a yellow green with a resinous to greasy luster.  It is non-fluorescent.  It is brittle with no observed cleavage and a splintery fracture.  Because of grain size, the hardness and density could not be measured but the density has been calculated to 2.235 g/cm3.\n\nGeological occurrence\nColimaite occurs as a sublimate from the volcanic fumaroles of the Colima volcano in Mexico. Other minerals including cristobalite, arcanite, thenardite, baryte and native gold have been collected from the fumaroles of this volcano. Although minerals were collected at temperatures from 400 to 800\u00a0\u00b0C, colimaite was assembled in a more narrow temperature interval of 450 - 600\u00a0\u00b0C. There are similarities between the volcanic gases of the Colima crater and the gases of other volcanoes, but there are some differences that make Colima unique.  Notable differences are the vanadium, zinc and copper enrichment of the Colima gases. These same gases also lack cadmium and molybdenum.\n\nSpecial characteristics\nNot only is colimaite the first new mineral species discovered in Mexico since 1998, but it is also the first newly recognized mineral species collected from the fumaroles of the Colima volcano crater. It was collected by the use of two silica tubes of one meter in length each, placed in a high temperature vent at the volcano's crater.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nEntry on mindat.org\nEntry on webmineral.com\n\nSulfide minerals\nOrthorhombic minerals\nMinerals in space group 62", "machine_text": " Colimaite is a rare mineral composed of cobalt arsenite sulfide, CoAsS, with a chemical structure of the type Co2+. Its name is derived from its discovery in the Colima Volcano of Mexico. Colimaite has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 and a specific gravity of 5.2\u20135.3. Colimaite forms short prismatic crystals which may be either yellowish to green or grey. Its prism faces are usually striated and it is usually found in association with quartz, barite and galena, although it may also be found with other rare minerals such as bournonite, violarite and l\u00f6llingite. Colimaite was first discovered in the Colima Volcano in the Mexican state of Jalisco. During the eruption of 1903, the eruption plume was found to contain a number of unknown minerals, including colimaite. Colimaite was subsequently identified and named after the volcano which spawned it in 1908. Since its initial discovery, colimaite has been found in only a handful of other locations, including in Romania, Mongolia and India. Colimaite is one of the members of the arsenopyrite group of cobalt sulfosalt minerals, along with boulangerite and nickeline. It is the cobalt analogue of bismuthinite, one of the most common sulfosalt minerals, and has been characterized to be a primary hydrothermal mineral. Colimaite is of interest to mineral collectors due to its rarity and its interesting yellow or greenish colour. For scientific purposes, colimaite is being studied for its potential use as an electron donor in the formation of hydrogen gas due to its cobalt composition. Although it may not be of great commercial importance as of yet, colimaite is an interesting and aesthetically-pleasing addition to specimen collections, having been identified and described by scientific mineralogists more than one hundred years ago.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25244611}

The highway is named after Floriano Rodrigues Pinheiro, a Brazilian lawyer, politician and writer born in 1852. The highway was inaugurated in 1939, but wasn't asphalted until 1978. The asphalt was placed in two bands of 7 meters width, having a signaling line in the center of the bands. The improvement works in the highway were carried out by the military government, which was in power from 1964 to 1985. Since its inauguration, the highway has witnessed the growth of two large cities, Pelotas and Cap\u00e3o da Canoa, now being vital for the economic development of the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Mother/Child Papers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mother/Child Papers is Alicia Ostriker\u2019s fourth book of poetry.  It was originally published by Momentum Press in 1980 and was re-published in 1986 and 2009.  The book is divided into four sections, and draws inspiration from the events of the Vietnam War era and Ostriker's personal experiences with motherhood.  In the work, Ostriker juxtaposes meditations on war against musings of motherhood and the experience of birth.  The many verses and prose pieces that comprise the book contrasts a woman's roles as teacher, mother, and wife, with the violence, corruption, and death of war.\n\nBackground\nOstriker began composing The Mother/Child Papers after the birth of her son, a few days following the shooting of four students at Kent State. In the work, Ostriker chronicles her fears of bringing a son into the brutal modern world with so many expectations and pre-constructed notions of what makes a great man, especially during wartime.  The title of the work similarly emphasizes its historic position by echoing The Pentagon Papers.  The Mother/Child Papers explores such topics as women's strengths, the joys and frustration of parenthood, shock and outrage over war, and the destruction of the natural environment, and challenges typical notions of mother-child relationships, female experience, and sexual perceptions of women.\n\nSummary\n\nI: Cambodia \nThe books begins with a lengthy prose section in which Ostriker recalls the events of her son, Gabriel's, May 14, 1970 birth and relates it to political developments that occurred around that time, most notably the Kent State Shootings and the beginning of Operation Total Victory, the United States invasion of Cambodia.  The three events are described in tandem, with each intertwined with the others.\n\nOstriker then tells of the births of her two older daughters.  One was delivered in a progressive Wisconsin hospital and another by midwife in England.  Ostriker says that these two experiences shaped her expectation of what childbirth should be like: \u201ca woman gives birth to a child, and the medical folk assist her.\u201d\n\nOstriker then speaks of the birth of her third child, Gabriel, at a southern California traditional hospital.  Despite having reached an agreement with her doctor about what drugs she was to be given during the procedure, while in the early stages of labor Ostriker inadvertently consented to being injected with Demerol, a sedative, thinking it was a local analgesic.  Under the effects of the Demerol, Ostriker then consented to receive a spinal anesthetic, which left her unable to feel anything from the waist down.  Upon waking, Ostriker was furious about being deprived of the experience of natural childbirth and relates the invasion of her body by the medical professionals who delivered the child to the US invasion of Cambodia.\n\nII: Mother/Child \nThe second section of the book is a series of related, untitled stream-of-consciousness poems alternating between the new mother and the child's perspective.  In these sections, Ostriker explores the intimate, even erotic, relationship between a mother and her infant child.   She expresses the different emotions she experienced towards the child during this time, from blissful admiration and boundless optimism, to bitter resentment and a wish that the \u201cleech\u201d would \u201cdie\u201d.\n\nThere are also a number of short prose sections in which Ostriker relates the events of the Kent State shooting and the immediate aftermath of Gabriel's birth.  References to war and devastation pervade both accounts; as Ostriker muses on the beauty of her child, she suddenly thinks of \u201cbabies stabbed in their little bellies / and hoisted up to the sky on bayonets\u201d.  The section ends with two titled pieces: \u201cParagraphs,\u201d a prose piece in which Ostriker examines the range of emotions new mothers feel towards their infants, ranging from almost divine love to murderous rage, and \u201cMother/Child: A Coda,\u201d in which she dispenses advice about life and consciousness to her child, alerting him to its savage, brutal nature, as well as its potential for transcendent beauty.\n\nIII: The Spaces \nThe third part of the book is the longest and is composed of a series of 16 titled prose and poetry pieces exploring life with the new child and its effects on the family.  In \u201cLetter to M.\u201d the speaker discusses the erotic pleasure inherent in nursing a child and ponders why this is never discussed in any parenting material.  The poem \u201cSong of the Abandoned One\u201d is written from the perspective of the infant's jealous and angry older sibling, begging her parents to \u201cKill the baby\u201d.  Ostriker recounts an experience with her family listening to a production of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth on the radio in \u201cMacbeth and the Kids In the Cabin at Chester.\u201d  In \u201cThings to Remember of Eve,\u201d Ostriker describes her daughter, Eve Ostriker, at two different stages in her life, at ages 8 and 21. In \u201cIn the Autumn of My Thirty-Seventh Birthday,\u201d Ostriker describes the sense of emptiness and depression she experienced dealing with family life, recounting also a discussion with a depressed friend, N., who refuses to take the antidepressants her psychiatrist prescribed her.  In \u201cExile,\u201d Ostriker considers the contrasting powers of love and violence, wondering when her son will grow to the point where \u201che will turn away\u201d from his mother's kisses \u201cnot to waste breath.\u201d  The poem's post-script reads, \u201cduring the evacuation of Phnom Penh, 1975.\u201d  \n\nIn the section's titular prose piece, \u201cThe Spaces,\u201d Ostriker recalls an ideal \u201cwindy, snowy January evening\u201d at home with her children.  Throughout the poem, there are a number of allusions to William Blake\u2019s Songs of Innocence, as well as a repeated lamb motif.  Ostriker\u2019s perfect winter day with her children is contrasted with her husband\u2019s discussion about entropy and the ultimate heat death of the universe.\n\nThe next poem, \u201cPropaganda Poem: Maybe For Some Young Mamas\u201d is divided into three parts.  In the first part, \u201cThe Visiting Poet,\u201d Ostriker recounts an experience she once had giving a guest lecture to a class of feminist college students.  She read the class a poem about pregnancy and was shocked when the class reacted with revulsion to the notion of motherhood.  Ostriker tries to explain that motherhood is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences possible for a woman to experience and that the class has been thoroughly brainwashed against it through patriarchal messages.  In part two, \u201cPostscript to Propaganda,\u201d Ostriker acknowledges that raising children is an incredibly difficult and demanding experience which wears a mother down, but she concludes the poem by asking the audience, \u201cCome on, you daughters of bitches, do you want to live forever?\u201d  The poem's last part, \u201cWhat Actually,\u201d indicts the \u201cideological lockstep\u201d that Ostriker claims dictates women's feelings on motherhood.  She goes on to explain that she believes that certain women are born to be mothers, while others simply were not.  She concludes by once more acknowledging that although raising children wears away at a person, so does anything enjoyable in life, and that those who refuse to do anything dangerous are \u201calready dead.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Leaf Pile,\u201d Ostriker recounts the events of an October day when, upon catching her son trying to put something dirty in his mouth, she slapped him.  The poem explores the workings of memory and how such events can be easily forgotten by the child but remain a vivid mark of shame for the parent.  The next work is a prose piece titled \u201cThe Seven Samurai, The Dolly, and Mary Cassatt.\u201d  Ostriker remembers an evening watching Akira Kurosawa\u2019s The Seven Samurai, trying to compare it to other masculine art works in an attempt to come to a better understanding of the male perspective.  She is interrupted by her children coming to her asking for attention and assistance.  She recalls a quote by W.B. Yeats about how one must choose between the perfection of one\u2019s craft and one's life before going to help her daughter with her report on Mary Cassatt.  The next poem, \u201cThe Change\u201d explores the relationship between animate and inanimate things how it parallels the distant relationship Ostriker's daughter maintains with her as they drive to her horseback riding lessons.  In \u201cOne, To Fly,\u201d Ostriker examines the transformation of her son Gabriel as he grows up.  In nursery school, he tells her that his three wishes are to be able to fly, to be able to talk to animals, and for there to be no more war.  The poem's last stanza reveals that at age 9, Gabriel has largely lost his pacifist nature due to bullying and social pressures and now fights children who bully him.  \u201cIn the Dust,\u201d the section's penultimate poem, deals with the development of Ostriker's daughter and examines the mother's own role in helping mold her daughter into an acceptable woman in society's eyes, even if that role has made the mother personally unhappy.  In the last poem of the section, \u201cHis Speed and Strength,\u201d Ostriker meditates on seeing her son at play, overtaking her on his bicycle, using his strength for a purely creative purpose.  She also sees a group of black and white children playing together without any tension and thinks to herself that maybe \u201cit is not necessary to make hate.\u201d\n\nIV: This Power \nThe book's last section is composed of three poems, \u201cOne Marries,\u201d \u201cThis Power,\u201d and \u201cDream.\u201d  \u201cOne Marries\u201d begins with a quote from Percy Shelley\u2019s Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, \u201cTo fear himself, and love all human kind.\u201d  In this poem, Ostriker meditates upon the dynamics of marriage, comparing its necessity for balance to the crude, simple domination of Imperialism.  In \u201cThis Power,\u201d Ostriker considers the respect and attraction children feel towards their mothers, even in the most degrading and trying circumstances.  \u201cDream,\u201d the book's last poem is very brief and describes\u201ca woman / oliveskinned like an Indian / brownhaired like a European\u201d \u201cgiving birth / comfortabl[y]\u201d for days on end.\n\nCritical reception\nThe Mother/Child Papers enjoyed fairly favorable reception upon its release.  The Iowa Review said, \u201cIt is startling to read the early pages of this book: where, before this, was the literature of squalid bliss and righteous woe of taking care of an infant? It is alive in Ostriker . . . one of the most intelligent and lyrical of American poets.\u201d  The American Poetry Review said, \u201cOstriker's work details the achievement of a connection between personal history and public fact as both present themselves to a very intelligent writer . . . Nothing in the novels of Margaret Drabble is as affecting, as convincing, as a few lines of Ostriker's.\u201d \n\nIn the years after the initial release of The Mother/Child Papers, it has come to be regarded as an extremely influential book in feminist circles.  Upon its 2009 republishing, poet Eleanor Wilner remarked, \u201cSo many women shed shame and took heart from The Mother/Child Papers, which feels as fresh and necessary as ever- feminism without dogma, motherhood without sanctimony, the power of the pen dipped in blood: this time not of battle but of birth. Rejoicing at its return, I recall how far this book-awakening us to all that had been left out of literature-was ahead of the curve: gravity's rainbow, the trajectory of a culture's once heaven-bound imagination, headed back to Earth.\u201d\n\nReferences\n\n1980 poetry books\nAmerican poetry collections", "machine_text": " The Mother/Child Papers is a short story collection by American novelist Alice Evans. Published in 1998, the book offers an intimate, often humorous, and sometimes heartbreaking look into the development of mother-child relationships. The collection includes fifteen stories about maternal bonds, addressing the unique challenges mothers face in raising their children and creating lasting relationships. The stories are told through a variety of perspectives, including that of a single mother raising her son, a mother of three trying to balance her children's needs, and a mother of adopted children seeking to understand their differences. Through these tales, Evans examines the struggles that accompany motherhood and the joys of unconditional love. The stories focus on the themes of identity, strength, independence, and acceptance as each character navigates their path between traditional motherhood and their own self-expression. The stories are often heartbreaking, as Evans tackles difficult issues like cancer, poverty, and abuse. Yet the collection is ultimately uplifting, as the characters ultimately find strength in the bonds of motherhood. The Mother/Child Papers has been widely praised for its insight and sensitivity. The collection has been praised for its nuanced portraits of characters and its ability to capture the complexities of mother-child relationships. It has also been praised for its exploration of the motherhood experience in all its beauty and difficulty. Critics have also praised Evans for her ability to craft stories that are full of emotion and insight. Alice Evans is also the author of several short story collections, including The Light Switches Dance and Burning Through the Hours, and has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize. The Mother/Child Papers stands out among Evans' work, as it offers readers a deeply personal and honest look at the dynamics of mother-child relationships.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34031264}

The fashion industry is constantly evolving, with new and different trends forming every season. From the hottest designer looks, to the most popular streetwear styles, the latest fashion is always changing and adapting to the ever-changing trends in society. The latest fashion trends are influenced by multiple sources, ranging from movies, celebrities, magazines, and music. Celebrity and movie style can have a huge influence on people's fashion choices. Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Beyonce have been known to set trends with their signature looks. Magazines are considered a primary source for fashion trends, as they often feature the latest looks that are popular with the masses. Music is also a great influence on fashion, as it tends to inspire creativity and out of the box fashion choices. The latest fashion is displayed in stores through multiple mediums. Stores such as Zara, H&M and Forever 21 often have some sort of display set up where shoppers can get an idea of the latest fashion trends. Stores can also launch their own trends and styles without having to rely solely on the trends of the fashion industry. There are also magazines and websites that display the latest styles and trends for specific fashion looks. The latest fashion is also determined by seasonal and weather trends. Light and bright colours tend to be popular during the spring and summer months, while dark, warmer colours are popular in the winter and fall. Wearing the right clothes for the season is also essential in staying up to date with the latest fashion. The fashion industry is very competitive and it is important to stay ahead of the trends to keep up with the latest fashion. To remain up-to-date, it is best to follow the latest trends in magazines and fashion blogs. Additionally, people should be aware of what is currently fashionable in their own area or community. It is also important to try new fashion trends in order to stay current.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28235776}

It is located on the Greater London border with Kent, bordering the Dartford Borough. It is located north west of Dartford.\n\nHistory\n\nUp until the Victorian era it was a hamlet a kilometre downstream of Crayford where no more than sixteen homes were clustered. A calico-printing works drew water power from the culverted River Wansunt in early Victorian times, being later adapted for the manufacture of rubber goods, then felt and finally Brussels carpets. This carpet mill was demolished by 1890 and Barnes Cray House, the next largest building, was cleared by 1933, ending its days as a nursing home.\n\nThe remnants of the settlement became absorbed into Crayford with the building of a munition village to facilitate the expansion of Vickers' armaments factory during the 1915 to 1919 period.\nIn 1920 the area became part of the Crayford Urban District of Kent (having previously been in Dartford Rural District). \nFollowing World War I Crayford Urban District Council erected further housing estates to the north, eventually merging with estates spreading southwards from Erith. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the urban district was abolished and its area transferred to Greater London to form part of the present-day London Borough of Bexley.\n\nThe Geoffrey Whitworth Theatre is in Barnes Cray.\n\nThe site of the current Barnes Cray Primary School is the proposed site for a new Academy for ages 3\u201319, which was consulted upon from September - December 2008, and the primary school will convert to the Academy in September 2009, with the secondary part of the Academy due to open in September 2010.\n\nTransport\nBarnes Cray is served by the Transport for London bus service 428 to Erith via Slade Green and to Bluewater via Dartford.

It is situated to the south of the Thames on the north-eastern outskirts of Greater London and is bounded by Bexleyheath, Erith, Crayford, St Mary's Cray, the London Borough of Bromley, the River Cray, the River Darent and Lessness Heath. The name has Saxon origins and is thought to mean \"the craggy stream\". The area was developed as a small rural village, but in the 19th century, industrialisation and the spread of London resulted in its expansion as a residential and industrial locality. The area is home to the Hall Place, a grade I listed 16th century Tudor mansion with formal and informal gardens, reflecting the impact of the Tudor settlement of the area. The Barnes Cray Settlement was initially called Welling and included Danson Park (formerly Danson Park House) and part of Hall Place (formerly the manor house for the Barnes Cray estate). Thomas More's Utopia was written at the Barnes Cray Estate. The Barnes Cray Church of England parish church is dedicated to St. Barnabus and was built in the late 19th century to replace a much older chapel in the same location. Barnes Cray is also home to a large industrial estate (the Barnet Cray Industrial Estate), a number of retail outlets, and a small number of restaurants. The industrial estate opened in the late 1950s and is now home to businesses in a variety of industries such as engineering, manufacturing, automotive and distribution. The industrial estate also contains a number of small business parks, professional services and advocacy-based organisations. The area is served by the Barnes Cray railway station, which opened in 1866 and is operated by South Eastern Railway. The station is on the North Kent line, with direct services to London Charing Cross, Cannon Street and London Bridge. Buses to central London and other parts of the borough are provided by the London Buses 421, 422, 469 and 366 routes. The area is surrounded by several green spaces, including Erith Marshe (to the north), Lessness Heath (to the east), Danson Park (to the south) and Hall Place (to the west). These parks and green spaces offer a range of outdoor activities, such as birdwatching, walking, cycling and fishing. The Barnes Cray area is mainly residential and its economy largely depends on local shops, businesses and services. Local people are actively involved in the area through local organisations, community groups and volunteer-led initiatives. In 2014, Barnes Cray was included in Mayor of London Boris Johnson's list of 28 Opportunity Areas which included deprived areas in London which Mayor of London Boris Johnson planned to improve. The idea was to ensure that all Londoners have access to education and employment, no matter where they live. Barnes Cray is a diverse and vibrant community, which is constantly evolving and working on ways to improve the quality of life for its residents.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rhinoceros auklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus Cerorhinca. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.\n\nIt ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also processes fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.\n\nThe rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).\n\nDistribution\nThe rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaid\u014d and Honsh\u016b, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.\n\nBreeding\nBreeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30\u201335 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35\u201345 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.\n\nRhinoceros Auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.\n\nFeeding\nAt sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater.  To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187\u00a0ft) for as long as 148 seconds.\n\nDiet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird's nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.\n\nEvolution and prehistoric species\nThe genus Cerorhinca evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of Cerorhinca is more complex than previously thought. Known prehistoric species are:\n\n Dubious auklet, Cerorhinca dubia L. H. Miller, 1925 (Late Miocene of San Barbara County, USA)\n Cerorhinca minor Howard, 1971 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Cedros Island, Mexico)\n Cerorhinca reai Chandler, 1990 (San Diego Late Pliocene, North American Southwest)\n Cerorhinca aurorensis N. A. Smith, 2011, a nomen nudum, only published in a PhD dissertation (Yorktown Formation Late Pliocene, North Carolina, USA)\n Cerorhinca sp. (Early Pliocene, Southeastern Woodlands)\n\nBill fluorescence \nSince rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate. The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. Also, the bill interestingly has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light, which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Rhinoceros Auklet Images http://tsuru-bird.net/image.htm \u2013 Monte M.

It is considered a close living relative of the extinct great auk, and is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"giant auklet\". The rhinoceros auklet is one of the smallest auklets, measuring about 17\u201319cm in length and weighing 75\u2013110 g. It is primarily grey with a white underside, similar in appearance to other auklets, but is distinguished by its large, pointed bill with a hook at the tip and obvious white lines on the face and around the eyes, giving the species its name. The rhinoceros auklet breeds in colonies on off-shore islands, often in large numbers. They live in burrows or crevices amongst rocks or vegetation, and spend much of the year at sea, where they feed on zooplankton. Nesting activities typically take place during June\u2013July, with the female laying a single egg that is incubated by both the parents. The chick will stay in its burrow until it is fully grown. In recent decades, the rhinoceros auklet population has seen an overall decline. This is largely attributed to the increase in predator predation, mainly due to introduced species such as rats and cats, as well as other human activities such as overfishing. Moreover, climate change has also been linked to shifts in the species\u2019 distribution. Although the rhinoceros auklet is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, the population is believed to be in decline and should be monitored carefully to prevent further population declines. The conservation of rhinoceros auklets has become a priority in many areas, and numerous programs have been implemented to protect nesting colonies. In British Columbia, the species is listed as a species at risk, and specific measures have been taken to combat nesting predators and to promote safe and successful breeding. In addition, there are several ongoing research projects that are aimed at learning more about the species and gaining a better understanding of its population trends and movements. Overall, the rhinoceros auklet is a fascinating species that plays an important role in the Pacific ocean ecosystem. In order to ensure its future as a species, it is important to continue research activities and conservation efforts in order to protect the species and its habitat.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1317988}

He was born in the Chatham County and moved to the Randolph County later in his life. Owen was an advocate for the rights of the state in the early 19th century and sought to defend North Carolina's sovereignty from what he and others believed to be encroachments from the federal government. Owen attended and graduated from Yale College in 1790, and moved around doing work in law, teaching, and in other professions. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1804 representing Montgomery County and served for four consecutive terms, becoming the Speaker of the House in 1808. In 1809, he left the House of Commons due to an appointment by President James Madison to become the Register in Bankruptcy of the Western District of North Carolina. He then moved to Johnson County where he became a farmer and operated a successful business. In 1810, Owen was again elected to the House of Commons to represent Randolph County. Owen was voted out at the next election in 1812, but was re-elected in 1814 and 1816. In 1818 and 1820, he lost the elections yet got elected in 1822, 1824 and 1826. During his time in the House of Commons, he supported freedom of speech, personal liberty, and judicial reform. He was also a supporter of education and was a proponent of the establishment of a state college, which was ultimately established as the University of North Carolina. Owen's political life was troubled by federal efforts to usurp state power. He opposed the Tariff of Abominations in 1828, which angered conservative forces within the state and ultimately cost him an election in 1832 when he ran to regain his seat in the House of Commons. He also sided with Governor Hutchins B. Godwin against the federal government as a leader of the 1832 Nullification Crisis by signing a resolution ordering the arrest of federal officers who did not respect the state's rights on land matters. Despite his accusations of being an extremist, John Owen was an important figure in the early 19th Century push to assert North Carolina's sovereignty. He served seven terms in the state House of Commons and was a passionate advocate for the rights of North Carolinians.

Both stations share studios on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard (near US 150) in downtown Louisville, while WDRB's transmitter is located in rural northeastern Floyd County, Indiana (northeast of Floyds Knobs).\n\nHistory\n\nAs an independent station\nThe first construction permit for channel 41 in Louisville was issued in 1953 to Robert Rounsaville, owner of WLOU (1350 AM), Louisville's first Black-oriented radio station. The station, if built, would have been the first Black-oriented TV station in the country. However, the construction of WQXL-TV depended on the success of the first of three planned stations, Atlanta's WQXI-TV, which failed and left the air in 1955. The permit remained active for several more years; the call letters were changed to WTAM-TV, and in 1963 the permit was sold to Producers, Inc., of Evansville, Indiana, but no station ever materialized. Producers was related to the Polaris Corporation, which in Louisville owned WKYW (900 AM).\n\nOn July 7, 1965, Consolidated Broadcasting Company, a group of five people from Chillicothe, Missouri with no television station experience (but were eventually shareholders for what would become ill-fated Kansas City independent station KCIT-TV), filed for a construction permit for the channel. The permit was granted on April 20, 1966, but it would be nearly five years before any station came to air. Antenna height issues and permitting setbacks caused delays for the new WDRB-TV and for a channel 21 permittee. Approval was finally obtained that summer, and Consolidated renovated a building that had housed a lithograph studio on East Main Street in the Butchertown neighborhood to serve as WDRB-TV's studios.\n\nWDRB-TV finally signed on the air on February 28, 1971, becoming the first independent station in the Louisville market. Initially, the station signed on at 3:00\u00a0p.m. on weekdays; its programming included low-budget afternoon children's programming and occasional news updates provided by anchor Wilson Hatcher, and, most notably, the Saturday night horror film strand Fright Night, hosted by local theater actor Charlie Kissinger. Not long after going on air, WDRB-TV debuted an afternoon children's program, \"Presto the Magic Clown\", hosted by Bill \"Presto\" Dopp. The station was profitable within months and tied then-ABC affiliate WLKY-TV in the ratings.\n\nBy 1976, WDRB-TV carried a mix of cartoons, westerns, outdoor shows and classic movies. The station's original owners sold the station for $6.5 million to the Minneapolis Star & Tribune Company (which later became the Cowles Media Company) in 1977. By that year, the station expanded its broadcast day to 11:00\u00a0a.m., with the addition of a four-hour block of religious programs; by 1979, WDRB-TV began signing on daily at 7:00\u00a0a.m.\n\nIn 1980, the station moved from Butchertown to its present location on Muhammad Ali Boulevard. However, WDRB-TV would eventually pull out of a contest for something it had sought since December 1977; a move from channel 41 to channel 21. In 1981, an administrative law judge had denied the application and preferred the competing bid from the Word Broadcasting Network, only for the FCC review board to overturn the decision.\n\nCowles exited television in the early 1980s. After selling its only other station, KTVH in Hutchinson, Kansas, it sold WDRB to Block Communications of Toledo, Ohio for $10 million in 1983. Under Block, WDRB-TV dropped the channel 21 application, clearing the way for WBNA to launch. Block began to increase WDRB's profile in the market by acquiring higher-rated and more recent off-network sitcoms and dramas to its schedule, along with a focus on the broadcast rights for the burgeoning athletic programs of the University of Louisville's Cardinals, which the station won in 1985 and held for two years.\n\nAs a Fox affiliate\nOn October 9, 1986, WDRB-TV became an affiliate of the Fox network and became known as \"Fox 41\" in late 1989. WDRB-TV became one of two Fox affiliates serving the Louisville market in 1990, when Campbellsville-based WGRB (channel 34, later CW affiliate WBKI-TV) affiliated with the network. Channel 34 served the southern portions of the market before it moved its transmitter farther north to service more of the market; WDRB became the sole Fox station in Louisville when WGRB became a WB affiliate in 1997.\n\nDuring the 1990s, WDRB shifted away from running older movies and classic sitcoms in favor of acquiring more talk and reality shows. In 1990, the station also regained rights to Louisville athletics in 1990 after the university spent three years with WHAS-TV and upgraded its transmitter, improving signal coverage. In 1994, Block Communications entered into a local marketing agreement to operate Salem, Indiana-based WFTE (channel 58, later WMYO, now WBKI); Block acquired WFTE outright in 2001, creating the first television station duopoly in the Louisville market. WDRB continued to carry cartoons through Fox Kids throughout the 1990s; the Fox Kids weekday afternoon lineup was discontinued at the end of 2001, when the remaining Saturday block moved to channel 58 until its successor 4KidsTV was discontinued by Fox in November 2008.\n\nOn April 21, 2007, WDRB became the first television station in Louisville to televise the Kentucky Derby Festival's all-day \"Thunder Over Louisville\" air and fireworks show in high definition\u2014which, at the time, was one of the largest technical undertakings ever attempted by an American television station. This was followed by a second\u2014even more elaborate\u2014\"Thunder\" telecast in HD in April 2008.\n\nThe station began phasing out the \"Fox 41\" branding in favor of simply branding by the WDRB call letters in May 2011. While this occurred shortly after sister station KTRV-TV in Boise, Idaho unexpectedly lost its Fox affiliation, station management stated that the rebrand was done in order to bring its branding in line with Louisville's other major network stations\u2013NBC affiliate WAVE (channel 3), ABC affiliate WHAS-TV (channel 11) and CBS affiliate WLKY (channel 32)\u2013who have all long branded with their call letters. Additionally, station management wanted to distinguish the station from Fox News Channel; WDRB is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references in their branding.\n\nIn early 2011, the master control operations for WDRB and WMYO were upgraded to allow the transmission of syndicated and locally produced programs in high definition; it also upgraded its severe weather ticker seen on both stations to be overlaid on HD programming without having to downconvert the content to standard definition.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, WDRB, WMYO and their respective subchannels were pulled from Insight Communications, what was then the market's major cable provider, as Block was unable to come to terms on a new retransmission consent agreement with Time Warner Cable (which purchased Insight in February 2012, but had not yet rebranded those systems under the latter until in 2013). The affected stations were restored on June 6, 2012, as a result of a new carriage agreement between Block and TWC.\n\nIn May 2013, WDRB began construction of an additional  of space at its Muhammad Ali Boulevard studio facility, including an expanded newsroom and sales area; the addition of two conference rooms; offices for finance and editing departments; and the addition of a secondary studio to be used for commercial and station projects. The $1.7 million expanded facility opened on May 5, 2014; as a result of the expansion, sister station WBKI-TV relocated their employees from that station's offices in the Kaden Tower into the WDRB facility.\n\nProgramming\nIn addition to carrying the entire Fox programming schedule, syndicated programs broadcast by WDRB include Live with Kelly and Ryan, Rachael Ray, Judge Judy and Dr. Phil.\n\nSports programming\nCurrently, all sports programming is provided by the network. However, for many years, WDRB had rights to University of Louisville Cardinals football and men's basketball games, some of which were syndicated through the Lorimar Sports Network or Raycom Sports packages of Metro Conference basketball games from the 1980s until the Metro Conference merger with the Great Midwest Conference to create Conference USA in 1995.\n\nWDRB also previously broadcast some University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball games at some point during the 1990s.\n\nNews operation\nWDRB presently broadcasts 57\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9\u00bd hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the broadcast television stations in the Louisville market and in the commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nAfter more than a year of planning, WDRB launched its news department on March 12, 1990, with the debut of a half-hour 10:00\u00a0p.m. newscast originally titled The News at 10. Many longtime news personalities in the Louisville market joined the new WDRB news staff when the station formed its news operation; many others have joined channel 41 from other stations since that time. The News at 10 was originally anchored by Lauretta Harris (who joined WDRB from WAVE), Jim Mitchell (who started in the market at WHAS-TV, before moving to WAVE), meteorologist Tammy Garrison, and sports anchor David Sullivan.\n\nIn 1995, the program was retitled as Fox News at 10 and expanded to one hour and added weekend editions on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Bill Francis (formerly of WLKY) and Susan Sweeney (formerly with radio station WHAS (840 AM)) joined the staff as anchors of the weekend newscasts; Tara Bassett (who had previously worked at WAVE) was the weekend weather anchor. The station launched additional newscasts on its schedule as its ratings position in the market strengthened: the first news expansion outside its established 10:00 slot came on October 5, 1998, when WDRB premiered the three-hour-long Fox in the Morning and a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30\u00a0a.m. (originally titled Fox First News); the latter program expanded to an hour on September 21, 2015, with the addition of a half-hour noon newscast. This was later followed by the debut of an hour-long 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast in September 2001.\n\nIn June 2002, WDRB became one of the few U.S. television stations to run a regular editorial segment, when it debuted \"Point of View\", a twice-weekly segment that is usually hosted by WDRB/WMYO president and general manager Bill Lamb; the segment introduced a weekly feature with viewer responses to the discussed topic via phone message in 2007. \"Point of View\" has evolved into one of the community's most prominent opinion forums, featuring frequent guest editorials by a wide array of community members. In 2006, WDRB\u2014in partnership with Norton Healthcare\u2014became the first and only station in Louisville to offer real-time closed captioning on all of its newscasts, making 100% of the station's news content available to over 147,000 deaf or hard of hearing viewers in the market. Prior to this, only pre-written studio-originated content was closed-captioned, while live field reports and breaking news stories were not transcribed.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, WDRB became the second television station in Louisville market (after WAVE) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; it was the first (and presently, the only) television station in the market to provide news video from the field in true high definition, as WDRB upgraded its ENG vehicles, satellite truck, studio and field cameras and other equipment in order to broadcast news footage from the field in high definition, in addition to segments broadcast from the main studio. By comparison at the time, WAVE only broadcast studio segments in HD, while field reports are presented in widescreen standard definition, while WHAS-TV and WLKY were still broadcasting in SD, stretched to fill 16:9 widescreen sets.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, WDRB launched a half-hour early evening newscast at 6:30\u00a0p.m. each weeknight (it is the only station in the United States that currently airs newscasts during the 4:00 and 6:30\u00a0p.m. timeslots); the program expanded to an hour-long broadcast on September 22, 2014, with the addition of a half-hour newscast at 6:00. WDRB began producing a half-hour weeknight 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on WBKI-TV on September 17, 2012; this was the result of a local marketing agreement that was forged between Block and WBKI-TV owner LM Communications, LLC (as such, WDRB is one of only a handful of Fox stations that produce a newscast for another station in the same market, among which include KCPQ in Seattle (which produces a 9:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KZJO) and KTVU in San Francisco (which produces a 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KICU-TV)); the WBKI newscast was canceled on September 19, 2015. On January 26, 2013, the station debuted a three-hour weekend morning newscast, airing Saturdays and Sundays from 6:00-9:00\u00a0a.m. On May 7, 2019, it was announced that WDRB had hired long-time WAVE anchor Scott Reynolds to anchor a new hour-long 5:00\u00a0p.m. newscast starting in September 2019.\n\nIn June 2013, WDRB gained notice in the television industry when it debuted a promo criticizing the broad, constant and generalized use of the term \"breaking news\" by other news stations (both within the Louisville market and around the United States), stating that \"breaking news\" has been overused as a \"marketing ploy\" by other stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, WDRB posted on its website a \"contract\" outline of its journalism practices with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to judiciously use \"breaking news\" (applying the term to stories that are \"both 'breaking' and \"news'\"), as well as a general promise to deliver news in a truthful, balanced and informative manner, and without overt hype and sensationalism.\n\nJune 2019 saw Bill Lamb departing the station after his successes with WDRB, and becoming the general manager of Fox Television Stations' West Coast flagship duopoly of KTTV and KCOP-TV. Ricky Joseph from fellow Block station WAND will serve as an interim president/GM until Lamb's replacement is found.\n\nThe station gained national attention in November 2019 for a sweeps interview with the founder of Papa John's Pizza, John Schnatter (who had been a controversial local figure since his July 2018 ouster over use of a racial slur on a conference call). Schnatter had made the claim to WDRB's Stephan Johnson that he had found the quality control of the chain had declined after saying he ordered forty pizzas to eat from it in a month long period, and warned of a 'day of reckoning' for company board member Mark Shapiro for participating in Schnatter's ouster from the company.\n\nTechnical information\n\nSubchannels\nThis station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nIn late 2010, Block Communications began testing digital subchannels on both WDRB and WMYO; on or about January 30, 2011, WDRB began carrying the Tribune Broadcasting-owned Antenna TV network over its second digital subchannel. WDRB-DT2 was added to Insight Communications systems in the area on digital channel 187 on April 20, 2011. On March 1, 2017, WDRB added a third digital subchannel carrying Ion Television on WDRB-DT3, after previous affiliate WBNA became an independent station, and eventually upgraded it to Ion's default 720p high-definition presentation (with the added advantage of few to no preemptions of Ion programming, which WBNA did regularly).\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nWDRB discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 41.\n\nOut-of-market coverage\nWDRB had previously been carried on many cable systems in areas adjacent to the Louisville market, including Kentucky's capital city, Frankfort. The channel was the first one sequentially on Frankfort's channel lineup (on channel 2), and was the sole source for Fox programming in HD in the capital city until 2012. On January 1, 2012, WDRB was removed from most cable systems outside of the market as a result of a corporate directive from Fox as part of its new affiliation agreement that forbade WDRB from being distributed on providers outside of its home market to protect ratings for the network's affiliates in nearby markets; this rule has been a source of conflict in several other markets, which have had out-of-market Fox affiliates from adjacent areas pulled from local cable providers. A few months later, the station removed the county outlines of Anderson and Franklin counties in Kentucky (the westernmost counties in the Lexington television market) and Switzerland County in Indiana (within the Cincinnati television market) from weather maps and severe weather alert displays; as a result, WDRB became the only Louisville area station that did not recognize Frankfort as being part of its viewing area. Despite this, Frankfort and Lawrenceburg are still occasionally mentioned during on-air weather segments. On December 20, 2017, the main cable provider in Frankfort, the Frankfort Plant Board, announced WDRB's return to their channel lineup, mainly for local news coverage, in 2018. Beginning sometime in April, WDRB returned on channels 4 and 504 in HD providing local news and syndicated programming while replacing Fox network programming with a cropped simulcast of Antenna TV from WDRB-DT2. At the same time, FPB began carrying the Antenna TV feed from WDRB-DT2 outright on channel 28, replacing the feed from WLJC-DT3 which had, in turn, replaced WTVQ-DT6 in early 2018 when Lexington's Antenna TV affiliation moved. WDRB was removed once again on January 1, 2021 after FPB and WDRB were unable to come to an agreement to continue carriage of the station, though this disagreement was based on financial differences rather than a network rule.\n\nIn the eastern half of the Bowling Green market, WDRB was carried on the Glasgow Electric Plant Board and South Central Rural Telephone Cooperative's cable system, despite the Glasgow area being in closer proximity to the viewing area of Nashville affiliate WZTV. However, blackouts of Fox programming by WBKO-DT2 were common, as was the blackouts of ABC programming from WHAS-TV were caused by WBKO's main channel. SCRTC and Glasgow EPB both dropped WDRB, WDRB-DT2 and WMYO in January 2015, with WDRB's main channel being dropped due to the presence of Fox affiliate WBKO-DT2; WMYO and WDRB-DT2 were respectively replaced by WCZU-LD, an upstart station serving as a primary MyNetworkTV and secondary Antenna TV affiliate. Both WBKO-DT2 and WCZU-LD claimed exclusivity in terms of Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliates on the Glasgow-based cable systems.\n\nWDRB remains available to Mediacom customers in Hart and Metcalfe counties. It is also available on Charter Spectrum channel 70 in the Owensboro and Henderson areas, as well as on Crystal Broadband Networks in Lewisport.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWDRB official website\nFright Night program info\n\nFox network affiliates\nAntenna TV affiliates\nIon Television affiliates\nNewsy affiliates\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1971\nDRB\n1971 establishments in Kentucky", "machine_text": " WDRB (sometimes referred to as WDRB-TV or WDRB 41) is a full-service television station in Louisville, Kentucky, broadcasting a local newscast, weather updates, and sports programs on digital channel 41 (UHF frequency 22) for the Louisville, Kentucky and Southern Indiana area.

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

The fairy wrasses are known for their bright neon colors.\n\nThe Orangeback Fairy Wrasses are like many wrasses in that they live in harems of many females in a group with only one male. The male is the dominant fish with the stronger colors and traits. There have been no small males that have been recorded so it is believed that all Orangeback Fairy Wrasses\u2019 begin as females and then some females transform into males.\nThe Cirrhilabrus species eats mainly Zooplankton, they have pair of teeth in the front and a set of teeth wrapped around the side which is used to break down their food.\nOrangeback Fairy wrasses are found in shallow waters mainly ranging from 10\u201375 feet but also can be found deeper.   When the Fairy wrasses are found in deeper depths however, their fluorescence allows them to see wavelengths that wouldn't otherwise be available. All Fairy Wrasses have great ability to see red fluorescence which is unique as most fish have poor sensitivity within this area.\nThere is much still not known about Orangeback Fairy Wrasses as most of the species have not been found in the open ocean.

Allen\nTaxa named by Rudie Hermann Kuiter\nFish described in 1999", "machine_text": " The Orangeback fairy-wrasse (Cirrhilabrus aurantidorsalis), is a species of fish in the Labridae family. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from East Africa to the Marquesan Islands and the East Indies. This species grows to a maximum length of around 9.5 cm. As their common name implies, Orangeback fairy-wrasse have a distinctive bright orange dorsal fin, with red or yellow scales providing a beautiful contrast. These distinctive scales, located in the front and lateral portions of the fish, are what makes this species so attractive and sought after by aquarists. The remainder of the body is primarily violet with yellow face and blue eyes. Orangeback fairy-wrasse are found near reefs, primarily in shallower waters where they feed on a variety of benthic organisms and small fish. These fish are social and often form small schools that find forage together. They can be territorial and will establish small domains within a reef, but are typically peaceful with their own species. Orangeback fairy-wrasse are an easy species to keep in the home aquarium. These fish prefer tanks with plenty of live rock, caves, and plenty of open space to swim. They can be kept singly or in small groups and should always be provided with plenty of cover. The ideal water temperature for this species is between 76-78\u00b0F. When Orangeback fairy-wrasse are kept in pairs or even small groups in the aquarium, they may form strong bonds. Captive specimens will often form fascinating courtship displays and color changes. When housed with conspecifics, these wrasses are most active and exhibit their most exciting behaviors. It is important to note that individuals from this species may sometimes become aggressive towards other fish, especially if they are of the same species. Orangeback fairy-wrasse are an excellent choice for aquariums of all sizes, from nano aquariums to larger aquariums. They are a beautiful addition to any tank and will provide hours of fun and fascination. With proper care and attention, these fish can live up to 10-15 years in captivity.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20674817}

The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its historic importance.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Polvor\u00edn was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly, who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III. Among O'Reilly's recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvor\u00edn) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770 and others as 1776.\n\nWhen the Spanish\u2013American War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvor\u00edn de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population.\n\nSince the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa B\u00e1rbara Chapel.\n\nWhen the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nEventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles. With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.\n\nSee also\n\n List of communities in Puerto Rico\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Ruins of Miraflores Magazine and Isla Grande\n\nMagazines (artillery)\nBuildings and structures in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nBuildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico\nNational Register of Historic Places in San Juan, Puerto Rico\nMilitary facilities on the National Register of Historic Places\nSpanish Colonial architecture in Puerto Rico", "machine_text": " Polvor\u00edn de Miraflores is a 17th-century fort in the Extremadura region of western Spain. It was built at the beginning of the 17th century by order of Philip III, to protect the borders of the province of Badajoz from the potential incursion of foes from Portugal. The fort is located in the municipality of Miraflores de la Sierra, close to the border with Portugal, and it stands on top of a mountain within the Sierra Morena region. It has a triangular shape, with its walls built in stone and rammed earth. Inside the fort, there are three independent structures that are interconnected via a short access way. The Polvor\u00edn was refurbished in the 1730s, with improvements made to fortify it in the event of looming conflict. Additionally, a wall was built alongside the structure in order to provide easy access to the various structures. Visitors of the Polvor\u00edn can appreciate its long and tumultuous history, which dates back to the 16th century. Moreover, the Polvor\u00edn is an important part of Spanish heritage as it is one of the few remaining examples of the country's Hispanic-Moorish history. The complex is made up of three structures, all interconnected by a corredor; the hovel has a two-meter-thick wall and can be accessed via a staircase, the central structure houses a cistern and has a capacity of 45,000 liters of water, and the third structure features several houses. In spite of the traditional beauty of the Polvor\u00edn, its military function ended long ago, and despite having been declared an Asset of Cultural Interest in 1990, its current state requires some vital restoration works in order to be restored to its former glory. In 2013, a project was established to commence the restoration works of the Polvor\u00edn, in spite of the challenging economic and technical difficulties. This project was similar to another carried out a few years before, both of which contain plans focused on restoring the structure and its original annexes. Presently, the Polvor\u00edn de Miraflores still holds a place of significant heritage-value in Spain, although its most notable past as a military fort is long over. Although the fort's restoration is still not completed, it remains an important haunting reminder of Spain's rich architectural heritage.

The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role.\n\nMullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school\n\nPlot\n\nThe story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets.\n\nBegrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the Hyde Park pet cemetery, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and \u201conly dogs can be depended upon\u201d. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one.\n\nThe following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for. \nThe children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as \u201che wasn\u2019t their grandfather\u201d, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree.\n\nThe following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.\n\nCast\n Peter Sellers as Sam  \n Donna Mullane as Liz  \n John Chaffey as Mark  \n David Daker as Bob Ellis\n Marjorie Yates as Chrissie Ellis  \n Patricia Brake as Dogs Home Secretary\n Don Crown as Busker\n Michael Graham Cox as Park Keeper\n Bruce Purchase as Policeman\n Pat Ashton as Woman at Nursery\n Keith Chegwin as Georgie (uncredited)\n Hilary Pritchard as Laundry lady (uncredited)\n\nNovel and screenplay\nSimmons is said to have planned the film around the time his two award-winning short films Sunday By the Sea (1953) and Bow Bells (1954) were released. Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works.  Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety wrote, \"It all sounds like goo, and the film\u2019s last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\" while The New York Times described the film as \"the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker.

The band was formed while they were all at school in London, beginning as a pure punk band, playing cover versions of other punk bands' songs. The band soon began writing and recording their own material, and released their first single, \"No Time For Love\", in March 1977. This was followed by their debut album, Nine Elms, in mid-1977. The album, which was praised for its witty songwriting and aggressive yet melodic sound, established the band's reputation in the punk rock scene, with the single \"Lies That Kill\" being a UK top twenty hit. The group's second album, Burn It Down, was released in 1980, and was widely lauded by both fans and critics as a darker, grittier record than its predecessor. The band's live shows were also becoming increasingly ambitious, with seven vocalists and multiple instruments creating an intense and powerful energy. The Optimists of Nine Elms toured extensively throughout the UK during this period, playing gigs in pubs and clubs as well as larger venues including the newly opened 9 Elms Station in London. Despite critical and commercial success, the band's third album, Lost in the Fire, flopped upon its release in 1983. Subsequently, the band split up, citing internal creative differences. Today, The Optimists of Nine Elms's music is still appreciated by fans of punk rock, and their influence can still be heard in more modern punk material.

He soon began to pursue formal study in biology, and eventually graduated from a university in France with a degree in veterinary medicine. After completing his studies, Jean went on to become an avid researcher of avian genetics. Jean the Birdman's first major breakthrough came after he identified a valuable mutation in chickens called the Feeble Wing Syndrome. He used this mutation to selectively breed chickens with larger wings, thus creating some of the earliest examples of modern poultry breeds. Jean's research of avian genetics continued, and he soon focused his attention on the cross-breeding of several different species of birds. He was able to successfully create hybrid birds exhibiting traits associated with both their parent species. This work was revolutionary at the time, and laid the foundations of modern modern avian genetics.

He has been featured in many international contemporary art fairs and exhibitions, and his works can be found in public and private collections around the world. His art is greatly influenced by practices and ideas from the media and the internet, as well as traditional art forms such as drawing and painting. Ardizzone was born in Palermo, Sicily in 1975. He began his artistic career in the late 1990s, inspired by the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and its subsequent developments in painting. His earlier work reflects this influence as it is composed of abstract elements derived from multiple media, mostly drawing, painting, photography and digital technology. Throughout his career, Ardizzone has developed a variety of distinct painting styles. In his most recent works, he has placed greater emphasis on the physicality and materiality of his work. He uses impasto painting techniques to create paintings that have an almost sculptural quality. He also likes to incorporate artificial elements such as metal scree, car parts, strings, wires and fiberglass into the painting. This approach gives his works a sense of tension and dynamism. Besides his painting practice, Ardizzone\u2019s works also include video installation, site-specific installations and public art, which often involve the landscape or urban environment of the cities in which he works. In most of these works, Ardizzone incorporates a strong social, political and cultural component. He often works with local communities and public institutions, in order to create works that are responsive and reflective of the society in which it is situated. Ardizzone has participated in numerous exhibitions, art fairs and biennales in the past few years, including the ArteFiera di Bologna, the BredaPhoto Festival in the Netherlands, the Festival Projeto SESC Cinco Sentidos in Brazil and the 50th International Biennale d\u2019arte Contemporanea in Rome. His work has been featured in publications such as The Guardian, New York Times, Photoreview and Contempora. Ardizzone currently lives and works in Palermo, Italy. He is represented internationally by the Curated by_Vienna and the B-Gallery in Vienna, Austria.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36027618}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nomos Glash\u00fctte\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NOMOS Glash\u00fctte is a German watchmaking company based in Glash\u00fctte, Saxony, which specializes in artisan manual-winding and automatic mechanical watches. It was founded in January 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by Roland Schwertner. The designs for the first collection were drawn up by Susanne G\u00fcnther, drawing influence from the Bauhaus purist style. NOMOS designs are known for their clean and modernist aesthetic. NOMOS Glash\u00fctte is a member of the Deutscher Werkbund, a predecessor of the Bauhaus movement and a group that represents the interests of companies that combine handcraft with industrial production, and design with functionality. The management team is made up of CEO Uwe Ahrendt, a graduate engineer and responsible for production; Judith Borowski, heading up communications and design in Berlin; and Roland Schwertner, who continues to be in charge of sales.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1990, Roland Schwertner, an IT expert and photographer from D\u00fcsseldorf, registered the trademark NOMOS Glash\u00fctte/SA. The first collection of NOMOS watches came out in 1992. NOMOS Glash\u00fctte now has three sites in Glash\u00fctte, a place renowned for its tradition of watchmaking: The administration department can be found in the former Glash\u00fctte station building, while most of the watchmakers are located on Am Erbenhang street. Since 2017, a further manufacturing facility can be found in the Schlottwitz district. Annual production is approximately 20,000 pieces. In its early years, the company focused on manufacturing mechanical watches with hand-wound movements. The basis for these movements was, until 2005, the Swiss-made ETA SA / Peseux 7001. Since April 2005, NOMOS Glash\u00fctte has only used in-house movements. Beginning with \u03b1 (Alpha), a manual winding caliber, the range has since been expanded to include a range of other manual winding movements with additional functions. The first automatic NOMOS watch, the Tangomat, was first introduced in the summer of 2005.\n\nIn 2014, the company unveiled its own in-house escapement, known as the NOMOS swing system, which made it no longer reliant on Swiss manufacturers. This new component was gradually introduced into NOMOS\u2019 caliber range. Since 2016, the company has concentrated on upgrading its caliber range with the NOMOS swing system; once upgraded, the calibers receive a name beginning with \"DUW\". This acronym stands for \"Deutsche Uhrenwerke\" and is intended to highlight the company's in-house caliber production.\n\nThe calibers in the company's neomatik (\u201cnew automatic\u201d) series are very thin: NOMOS Glash\u00fctte introduced DUW 3001, its tenth in-house caliber, in 2015. At only 3.2\u00a0mm in height, this caliber is exclusive to the neomatik series, launched at BaselWorld 2016. The latest movement, DUW 6101, or \u201cneomatik date,\u201d was introduced in 2018. In this year the company also introduced the models Autobahn and Tangente Update, which debuted the neomatik date caliber. At BaselWorld 2019, the company introduced three new collections: the duo series, three new sport watches (two versions of Tangente Sport and one of Club Sport), and three automatic Club Campus models.\n\nModels \nThe brand started production in 1992 with four basic models (Tangente, Orion, Ludwig, and Tetra). NOMOS Glash\u00fctte has since gradually expanded its range of watches to include new models and sizes, such as Club and Metro. In 2013 the company introduced two gold models to its collection, Lambda and Lux. There are currently thirteen NOMOS watch models, which come in a number of variations. These are:\n\nTangente (1992): originally hand-wound with optional date function, power reserve indicator, white or champagne-colored dial, in 33, 35,  38, 39, and 41\u00a0mm diameter; also available as a limited edition for Doctors Without Borders in the UK, USA, and Germany\nTetra (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, power reserve indicator, various dial colors, in 27, 29.5, and 33\u00a0mm diameter; also available as a special edition for Doctors Without Borders in Germany\nOrion (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, various dial colors, in 33, 35, 38, 39, and 41\u00a0mm diameter\nLudwig (1992): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or champagner dial, in 33, 35, 38, and 41\u00a0mm diameter\nTangomat (2005): automatic in 38\u00a0mm diameter with optional date function, white or dark-colored dial, and world time function\nClub (2007): hand-wound with optional automatic winding, date function, white or dark-colored dial, in 36, 38, and 40\u00a0mm diameter\nZurich (2009): automatic in 40\u00a0mm diameter with optional date function, various dial colors, and world time function\nAhoi (2013): automatic, 36 or 40\u00a0mm in diameter with water-resistance to 20 atm, optional date function, and various dial color options\nLux (2013): hand-wound shape watch in 18 kt white or rose gold, various dial colors, in two sizes: 40.5 \u00d7 36\u00a0mm and 38.5 \u00d7 34\u00a0mm\nLambda (2013): hand-wound watch in 18 kt white or rose gold; black, deep blue or off-white dial, in two sizes: 39 and 42\u00a0mm diameter\nMetro (2014): hand-wound in 35, 37, 38, or 39\u00a0mm diameter with date, power reserve indicator, and various dial color options\nMinimatik (2015): automatic in 35.5\u00a0mm diameter, available in white, champagne, or midnight blue\nAutobahn (2018): automatic in 41\u00a0mm diameter with date function, superluminova on dial, and three dial color options\n\nCalibers \n\nNOMOS Glash\u00fctte owns multiple patents for their calibers, such as for the in-house date mechanism, power reserve display and for the proprietary escapement, the NOMOS swing system.

Further special features include: stop-seconds mechanism, fine adjustment in six positions, Glash\u00fctte-style NOMOS stopwork, tempered blue screws, sunburst finish on the ratchet and crown wheel. Additional features of the movements DUW 1001 and 2002: swan neck fine adjustment, hand-engraved balance cock, screwed gold chatons, 84-hour power reserve, twin mainspring barrel, screw balance.\n\nAwards\nNOMOS watches have won more than 150 prestigious design awards to date (as of December 2018), including the iF Design Award, the Good Design Award, the red dot Design Award, and the German Design Award. In 2018, NOMOS Glash\u00fctte became the first non-Swiss brand after A. Lange & S\u00f6hne to win the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve (GPHG), the Oscars of the watchmaking world, with the Tangente Update model\u2014which has also been awarded the European Product Design Award (EPDA).\n\nOther \n\"Nomos\" means law or rule in Greek. In 1906, a company called \"Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft, Guido M\u00fcller & Co.\" started importing Swiss watches and distributing them with the more prestigious addition \u201cGlash\u00fctte/Sachsen\u201d. For a watch company to include \u201cGlash\u00fctte\u201d in their name, at least 50% of the caliber must be manufactured in Glash\u00fctte; this is up to 95% for NOMOS Glash\u00fctte, but was not the case for the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft. The renowned company A. Lange & S\u00f6hne took them to court and in 1910 the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft ceased business operations. The Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft from the early 1900s and today's NOMOS Glash\u00fctte have nothing more than the name Nomos in common.\n\nLiterature \n Schmid, Hans Heinrich: Lexikon der Deutschen Uhrenindustrie 1850 - 1980 : \n Design Klassiker, Die Tangente von NOMOS Glash\u00fctte, .\n NOMOS Glash\u00fctte - Das gro\u00dfe Universallexikon Berlin: Birkh\u00e4user 2004, .\n Doerr, Elizabeth: Bravo, NOMOS!

The company was founded in 1990 by Roland Schwertner, Uwe Ahrendt and Simon Husslein, who wanted to create watches of superior quality and unique design. The three set out to create their own watch movements, rather than relying on existing Swiss components. After several false starts, they perfected the DUW quality standard and produced their first in-house movement in 2005 \u2013 the hand-wound Alpha caliber. This was followed by the fully automatic Beta movement two years later. The Nomos watch collection is divided into six main families, each featuring watches with different designs and functions. The Tangente series is the most recognizable, with its simple three-handed design and minimalistic look, which has become iconic in watchmaking circles. The Club series offers a statement piece with its eye-catching curved lugs, while the Metro series has a rectangular case inspired by the Bauhaus architecture.

She then played  supporting roles in films such as Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and Swingers (1996), and on the television series Twin Peaks (1991). She gained critical praise for her role as \"Rollergirl\" in the film Boogie Nights (1997). This led to major roles in the comedy films Bowfinger and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (both 1999).\n\nGraham had leading roles in Say It Isn't So (2001) and From Hell (2001), and continued to play supporting roles in the films Mary (2005),  The Hangover (2009) and its sequel, The Hangover Part III (2013), At Any Price (2012), and Horns (2013). She has had roles on television series such as Scrubs (2004) and Californication (2014).\n\nNoted for portraying characters with sex appeal, she often appears in magazine lists of \"Most Beautiful\" and \"Sexiest\" women. Graham is a public advocate for Children International, and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.\n\nEarly life\nGraham was born on January 29, 1970, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at St. Michaels Hospital, the older of two children. Her family is of \"three-quarters Irish\" descent, with her father's side from County Cork. Her younger sister, Aimee Graham, is also an actress, and writer. Her mother, Joan (n\u00e9e Bransfield), is a teacher and author of children's books and her father, James Graham, is a retired FBI agent. She was raised Catholic, but is non-practicing. Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California, when she was 9 years old. She was introduced to acting during a school production of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAfter high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years. Against her parents' wishes, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full-time.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly work (1984\u20131988)\nGraham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in Mrs. Soffel (1984). Her first credited film appearance was in the television film Student Exchange. In 1986, she appeared on a special \"Teen Week\" episode of the NBC game show Scrabble. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom Growing Pains in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger's mother in Twins (during the laboratory conception flashback).\n\nFrom Drugstore Cowboy to Swingers (1989\u20131996)\nIn 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive. After Drugstore Cowboy, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.\n\nAfter Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in Twin Peaks, where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show's cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\n\nShe featured in Diggstown (1992), alongside James Woods; the well-received Six Degrees of Separation (1993), alongside Will Smith; and The Ballad of Little Jo (1993), alongside Ian McKellen before reteaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned film adaptation of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, alongside Uma Thurman. The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. In 1995, she starred as Jackie in the poorly received Desert Winds and guest-starred in an episode of the television series Fallen Angels. She had a small but important role in Swingers (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau's love interest. She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996).\n\nWider industry and public recognition (1997\u20132003)\nGraham's popularity significantly increased after playing a young porn star in the critically acclaimed film Boogie Nights (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year, she also starred in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and had a cameo in the horror hit Scream 2. She was subsequently cast in Two Girls and a Guy (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters, shot in 11 days, which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film Lost in Space, which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.\n\nShe starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), which was a box-office hit.

Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie Bowfinger, opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.\n\nThe 2000 film Committed was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes summary of critics felt that \"Graham shows she can play a central character\", but noted \"she's not enough to make Committed successful\". The following year, she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns' Sidewalks of New York. In 2003, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige's English-language debut film Killing Me Softly, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: \"Respected director Chen Kaige's first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue\". In 2009, the site also rated it No.\u00a012 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.\n\nGraham's other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film From Hell (2001), starring Johnny Depp; Anger Management (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy Say It Isn't So (2001), opposite Sally Field; The Guru, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and Hope Springs (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.\n\nFocus on independent films and television (2004\u20132008)\n\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films Gray Matters, Broken, Adrift in Manhattan (all 2007), and Miss Conception (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office.

In 2006, she co-starred in Bobby as Angela; the film's cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nGraham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled The Accidental Virgin, which would have focused on \"female sexual confusion\", telling the story of a woman who has not had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if it is \"something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do\".\n\nOn television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series Sex and the City. She was given special guest-star status on nine episodes of NBC-TV's Scrubs during its fourth season (2004\u20132005), and also appeared as George Michael Bluth's ethics teacher in an episode of Fox's television series, Arrested Development in 2004. She played Emily Sanders in Emily's Reasons Why Not, but the sitcom was cancelled after airing only one episode.\n\nThe Hangover and after (2009\u2013present)\nIn 2009, Graham played the stripper with a heart of gold, Jade, in The Hangover, which was released to critical and box-office success. She won the role after Lindsay Lohan turned it down. Though she did not return for the sequel The Hangover Part II, she reprised her role in the final installment of the trilogy, The Hangover Part III. In 2010, she starred in Boogie Woogie, followed by roles in the unsuccessful films Father of Invention, 5 Days of War, Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer (all 2011), and About Cherry (2012).\n\nGraham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing game EverQuest 2.\n\nShe played Meredith Crown in At Any Price, which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals.

She wrote a comedy screenplay called Half Magic, which in 2013 she stated she wanted to direct. She said the story focuses on \"these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism\". The film was released in 2018.\n\nIn 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel Flowers in the Attic on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger, an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic to receive an inheritance from her dying father. Graham also appeared in two TV-movie sequels based on the V.C. Andrews' series: Petals on the Wind and If There Be Thorns, continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger. She appeared in the final season of Californication as the mother of David Duchovny's long-lost son.\n\nIn 2018, she co-starred in the David Cross dark comedy series Bliss, which was released by the BritBox streaming service. It starred Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who struggles to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another.\n\nActivism\nBesides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Children International. She stated that what she likes about Children International is that \"you are helping a child have a better life. It's great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them\". Graham works with the Cambodian Children's Fund, also an NGO, which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. \"There's a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,\" Graham has said. \"Women are dying because they don't have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children's Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We're creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.\"\n\nIn 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur's short film Global Cool alongside Sienna Miller.\n\nIn the media\nGraham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in FHM'''s 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number 74 in the 2005 list and at number 98 in 2006 list. In 2001, she was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by People. In 2003, she posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician who later also sawed her in half. Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of Time for an article titled \"The Science of Meditation\". To promote Emily's Reasons Why Not, she had posed for a LIFE cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as \"TV's sexiest star\", which appeared in the January 27, 2006, issue.\n\nGraham is often cast in sexual roles, including those of Felicity Shagwell (Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), porn stars Rollergirl (Boogie Nights) and Sharonna (The Guru), prostitute Mary Kelly (From Hell), porn director Margaret (About Cherry), and stripper Jade (The Hangover and The Hangover, Part III). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that \"our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?\" and that she likes \"the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex\".\n\nIn 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman for the Garnier brand of hair care products.\n\nIn 2017, Graham recounted a time in the early 2000's when Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein indirectly implied that he would give her a role of her choice if she slept with him. Later, Graham indicated she canceled a planned meeting with Weinstein at a hotel when a friend was unable to accompany her. Graham did not have further contact with Weinstein and she was never cast in one of the movies he produced.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGraham has been estranged from her parents in the past. Regarding the media's perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: \"I don't really like to talk about my parents. Because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press\u00a0...\"\n\nGraham has been practicing transcendental meditation since 1991 after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She has also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: \"I think some of it, it seems strange \u2013 why do we all want to watch people be so miserable?  Other people's pain and misery \u2013 it seems kind of sad.\"\n\nIn 1992, Graham dated James Woods, her co-star in the film Diggstown''. From 2011 to 2018, she was in a relationship with Israeli screenwriter Yaniv Raz. She also dated Heath Ledger.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nVideo games\nDancer in 1999 Lenny Kravitz music video \"American Woman.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1970 births\n20th-century American actresses\n21st-century American actresses\nActresses from Milwaukee\nAmerican child actresses\nAmerican film actresses\nAmerican people of Irish descent\nAmerican television actresses\nContestants on American game shows\nLiving people\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles alumni", "machine_text": " Heather Graham (born January 29, 1970) is an American actress and filmmaker, best known for her roles in the films Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Boogie Nights (1997), Bowfinger (1999), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Say It Isn't So (2001), The Hangover (2009) and The Hangover Part III (2013). In addition to her performances in film, Graham has appeared on television, in music videos and on stage. She also wrote and directed the film Half Magic (2018). Graham was born to Joan, a schoolteacher and children's book author, and James Graham, an FBI agent. She initially followed in her father\u2019s footsteps and went to university to pursue a degree in English Literature, but eventually changed her mind and sought a career in acting. Her first major role came in 1984 when she was cast as a cheerleader in the horror film Night of the Demons (1988). This was followed by her breakthrough performance in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy (1989). The film earned Graham rave reviews and established her as an actress to watch. Graham's success continued throughout the early to mid-1990s as she starred in films like Gus Van Sant's iconic drama To Die For (1995), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999) and Bowfinger (1999). In 1997, Graham achieved critical acclaim for her performance as exotic dancer Rollergirl in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, a role which earned her a nomination for a Golden Globe. In the same year, Graham was featured the music video for the Alanis Morissette single \"You Oughta Know\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Australasian treecreeper\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "There are seven species of Australasian treecreeper in the passerine bird family Climacteridae. They are medium-small, mostly brown birds with patterning on their underparts, and all are endemic to Australia-New Guinea. They resemble, but are not closely related to, the Holarctic treecreepers. The family is one of several families identified by DNA\u2013DNA hybridisation studies to be part of the  Australo-Papuan songbird radiation. There is some molecular support for suggesting that their closest relatives are the large lyrebirds.\n\nAs their name implies, treecreepers forage for insects and other small creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf-litter, and on fallen timber. Unlike the Holarctic treecreepers they do not use their tail for support when climbing tree trunks, only their feet.\n\nAustralasian treecreepers nest in holes in trees. The species in the family hold breeding territories, although the extent to which they are defended and last varies. Some species, such as the red-browed treecreeper and the brown treecreeper are cooperative breeders, others, like the white-throated treecreeper are not.  The cooperative breeders form groups or a single breeding pair as well as up to three helpers, which are usually the young males of previous pairings. Helpers assist with the construction of the nest, feeding of the incubating female and feeding and defending the young.\n\nDescription\nThe Australasian treecreepers are small oscine songbirds, measuring  in length and weighing . They have relatively long tails, short legs with strong feet, stout bodies and longish and slightly down-curved bills. The plumage of this family is dull, trending towards brown, reddish-brown or greyish brown above and paler below. There is usually some sexual dimorphism in plumage, with females having some reddish colour in the head or breast that is absent in the males. Other differences between the sexes are common, and can arise very early in the life of these birds, being present even in late-stage nestlings. They are poor fliers, with their flight described as undulating and gliding.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nAll the Australian treecreepers are endemic to Australia except for one species restricted to New Guinea. They are found across much of Australia except for the large island of Tasmania, possibly because they are poor fliers and unable to disperse across water barriers, or possibly because of a lack of bark-dwelling invertebrates to feed on.\n\nAcross their global distribution they occupy a wide range of habitats. The Papuan treecreeper is found in mid-montane to montane forested habitats on New Guinea, from . The white-browed treecreeper inhabits acacia and Casuarina woodlands in deserts in southern Australia. Other species inhabit subtropical rainforest, eucalypt woodlands and southern beech forests. The brown treecreeper is semi-terrestrial and can live in more open woodland habitats, but is still sensitive to the loss of its habitat. The Australasian treecreepers are essentially non-migratory, although there are distinct differences in the dispersal of young birds after fledging, especially between the two genera.\n\nBehaviour\n\nDiet and feeding\nThe Australasian treecreepers principally forage for arthropods found on the bark of trees, but they will also take prey from the ground and will eat tree sap and nectar from flowers. They commonly obtain insect prey by gleaning from surface of bark, but will also probe into holes and pull at loose strips of bark and flick underneath it with their quadrifid tongue.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nReferences\n\n Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

They are small to medium sized birds, reaching an average of 15-16 centimetres in length. They are predominately brown in colour with white patches across the wings and tail. The head and underparts are typically more grey in colour. Australasian treecreepers occur in a wide variety of habitats, from low-lying wet forests to open woodlands with scattered trees. They can also commonly be found in rural and urban areas. The Australasian treecreeper feeds on insects and spiders, which it picks up from tree bark. This is done by hopping up along tree trunks and branches in a spiral pattern, using their curved bill to probe the tree bark for its prey. They may also glean insects from foliage at times. Treecreepers are solitary or found in pairs during the breeding season. Nesting is usually in a hole in a tree where the female lays up to 4 eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 15-17 days before both parents share in feeding the young. Australasian treecreepers are resident species, with some local movements to follow the insect availability occurring. In migratory seasons, they may move northwards in search of food. Threats to the population include competition from introduced species, habitat loss, nest predation and illegal trapping. They are protected from hunting in all Australian and Tasmanian states and territories. The Australasian treecreeper is an attractive species and a welcome inhabitant of many home gardens. They are easily attracted to bird feeders and can provide hours of entertainment. ", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 268105}

The year 1814 was a tumultuous and consequential year in European history. It marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which began in 1799, and the start of the Congress of Vienna, which led Europe into a century of relative peace. In the beginning of the year, Napoleon Bonaparte had forced the first abdication of his title as the Emperor of France. England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and formed the Coalition forces to invade France. Europe was forced further into chaos by multiple wars and invasions, until Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in April. This led to the restoration of French monarchy, the return of the Bourbon dynasty, and the creation of the Bourbon Restoration. In July of 1814, the Congress of Vienna was convened. This conference marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the start of one of the longest periods of peace Europe had seen since the fall of the Roman Empire. The Congress resulted in the redrawing of boundaries and the creation of new states, as well as the establishment of the German Confederation, which had a shared political and economic federal government. In August of 1814, Louis XVIII of France was crowned king of France and Navarre. October 31 of the same year marked the formation of the Allied Kingdom of the Netherlands from the Austrian Netherlands, the former Dutch Republic, which had become a French puppet state earlier in the century. The year 1814 saw new inventions, discoveries, and inventions being made. The steam locomotive and bicycle were both developed in 1814, as were irrigation methods and high-pressure industrial machines. In Germany, the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer published his book The World as Will and Representation, a seminal work in the field of philosophy. The year 1814 also saw the completion of many great works of art. Artist Francisco de Goya completed his series of etchings and prints, The Disasters of War, depicting the horrors of the Peninsular War in Spain. At the same time, Ludwig van Beethoven composed his Ninth Symphony and his Violin Concerto in D Major, adding two of his most enduring works to the musical canon. 1814 marked the end of a tumultuous period in European history, and from it sprung a period of relative peace and prosperity. New advances and developments in technology, science, and culture opened the doors to a new era of international cooperation and understanding.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34948}

The first game, Plants vs. Zombies, was developed and released by PopCap before its acquisition by EA. After PopCap Games's acquisition, EA expanded the game into a franchise with games on many different platforms.\n\nHistory\n\nMain series\nOn April 1, 2009, PopCap released a music video for the song \"Zombies on your Lawn\" to promote Plants vs. Zombies. A PopCap spokesperson, Garth  Chouteau, revealed in an IGN interview that Plants vs. Zombies would be released soon on PC and Mac. On April 22, 2009, PopCap released an official game trailer of Plants vs. Zombies on YouTube. During the promotion of Plants vs. Zombies, PopCap released a demo version of the game that allowed you to play the game for thirty minutes. Plants vs. Zombies was officially released on May 5, 2009, for PC and Mac.\n\nPopCap Games and its assets were bought by EA on July 12, 2011, for 750 million dollars. Fifty employees were laid off in the Seattle studio of PopCap Games on August 21, 2012, to mark a switch of focus to mobile and social gaming.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, PopCap announced that they were working on a sequel to Plants vs. Zombies. Its release date would be set at late spring of 2013. However, the game's status was in doubt shortly after the announcement when the company went through a period of layoffs. \n\nIn May 2013, PopCap Games released a trailer revealing a sequel to the first game, titled Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time. The game was soft-launched for the iOS in Australia and New Zealand on July 10, 2013, and was officially released on August 14, 2013, as a freemium title. The game featured new locations and plants along with the addition of plant food, a power-up that can be used to enhance a plant for a short period and can either be bought using in-game currency or acquired by defeating zombies that are glowing green.\n\nIn July 2019, EA announced Plants vs. Zombies 3, another free-to-play mobile title in the series. It was launched in a pre-alpha state for Android in July 2019. The game soft-launched in February 2020 in the Philippines, Romania, and Ireland. It was then made unavailable in October 2020, becoming unplayable in November 2020. EA has plans to release an improved version of the game in the future. On September 7, 2021, a Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft launched again with substantial changes, such as two-dimensional graphics and the return of the Sunflower.\n\nSpin-offs\nA spin-off called Plants vs. Zombies Adventures was announced in March 2013 and was released on May 20, 2013, on Facebook. The game added new locations and new plants. It also had a gameplay feature in which the player had a limited amount of plants and had to grow more plants at an in-game farm. In July 2014, it was announced that Plants vs. Zombies Adventures would close down on October 12, 2014.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare was announced at E3 2013 as a multiplayer third-person shooter game developed for PC and consoles. Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare was released on February 25, 2014, in North America and on February 27, 2014, in Europe. A sequel, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, was teased in June 2015 and officially announced at E3 2015. The game was released on February 23, 2016. On March 10, 2016, PopCap announced Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, a digital collectible card game in the style of tower defense. It was soft released to certain countries on the same day, and was fully released internationally on October 18, 2016.\n\nIn August 2019, a closed beta of a follow-up to Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 codenamed \"Picnic\" was made available to select players through invites. And on September 4, 2019, EA announced the sequel's title; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville. It was released in an early access state that same date. The game was fully released on October 18, 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\n \nVideo game franchises introduced in 2009\nPopCap games", "machine_text": " Plants vs. Zombies is a tower defense and strategy video game developed and originally published by PopCap Games for Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2009. Players assume the role of a homeowner in the game, tasked with using a variety of different plants to repel hordes of zombies from \"invading\" their home. The idea is to help the homeowner build an arsenal of different plants and then utilize these plants to protect their house from the relentless zombie siege. The game is relatively simple in concept: the player is presented with a grid of squares, representing the homeowner's garden, upon which they can place various plants to thwart the zombie attacks. Each plant has its own special power, and the player must utilize the available plants in an attempt to fend off the zombie attacks. The player must also make strategic decisions in order to outsmart their opponents and survive the waves of zombies. The game also features other elements, which add a certain level of chaos and fun to the proceedings. The zombies themselves come in various shapes and sizes, and have their own special abilities, making them quite difficult to eliminate, as the player may need to use specific plants to take out certain enemies. There are also a few mini-games interspersed throughout the game as well, which can offer the player a breather from the main action in between waves. The graphics of the game are quite cartoonish and cheerful, helping to keep the game lighthearted and enjoyable. The sound effects are also of a high-quality and are particularly good at environmental atmospherics, such as the sound of birds chirping in the background. The music of the game is just as good, and fitting to the action taking place in each wave. There have been several versions of the game released since it first debuted in 2009, including a spin-off game, as well as mobile versions for iOS and Android devices. Plants vs. Zombies has been critically acclaimed since its launch, and is cited as one of the top tower defense games of all time. Thanks to its easy learning curve, engaging gameplay and polished presentation, Plants vs. Zombies is still highly regarded today, and is sure to delight gamers for many more years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 67026877}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A screw and a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below) are similar types of fastener typically made of metal and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in a matching part. \n\nScrews are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and  prevents pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; materials commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\nExplanation\nA screw is a combination of simple machines: it is, in essence, an inclined plane wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge at the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, called a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut object with an internal thread.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\nA screw will usually have a head on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include a screwdrivers and a wrench. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions. A carriage bolt has a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  A set screw may have a head the same size or smaller than the outer diameter of the screws thread; a set screw without a head is sometimes called a grub screw. A J-bolt has a J-shaped head that is sunk into concrete to serve as an anchor bolt. \n\nThe cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the pitch.\n\nMost screws and bolts are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.\n\nDifferentiation between bolt and screw\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows:\n\nThis distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt.\n\nThe issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with Machinery's Handbook distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:\n\nWood screws \nEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws. Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England. During the 1850s, swaging tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads. Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).\n\nOnce screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\nMachine screws \nASME standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\" in diameters ranging up to .  These fasteners are often used as bolts with nuts, but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\nHex cap screws \nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is  in diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  Machinery's Handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\". Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the \"Finished Hex Bolts\" and renamed them the \"Hex Cap Screw\"\u2014a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.\n\nLug bolts and head bolts \nThese terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with Machinery's Handbook distinction.\n\nLag screw \n\nLag screws (US) or coach screws (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the Handbook. However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\nUnited States government standards \nThe federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).\n\nHistorical issue \nOld USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\nControlled vocabulary versus natural language \nThe distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word bolt is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.\n\nOther distinctions\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.  On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\nTypes of screws and bolts\n\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are generally designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\nFasteners with a tapered shank\n\nFasteners with a non-tapered shank\n\nFasteners with built in washers\nA fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\nOther threaded fasteners\n\nSuperbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner \nA superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\nBone screws\n\nThe field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\nList of abbreviations for types of screws\n\nThese abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, knowing that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", it may be possible to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.\n\nThe extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.\n\nMaterials\n\nScrews and bolts are usually made of steel. \nWhere great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.\n\nGalvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. \nSome types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.\n\nOften a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.\n\nSelection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.\n\nMechanical classifications\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.\n\nMetric \n\nThe international standards for metric externally threaded fasteners are ISO 898-1 for property classes produced from carbon steels and ISO 3506-1 for property classes produced from corrosion resistant steels.\n\nInch \nThere are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 & ASTM A193.\n\nScrew head shapes\n\n  A low disc with a rounded, high outer edge with large surface area.\n Button or  Cylindrical with a rounded top.\n  A dome-shaped head used for decoration.\n Mushroom or  Lower-profile dome designed to prevent tampering.\n Countersunk or  Conical, with flat outer face and tapering inner face allowing it to sink into the material. The angle of the screw is measured as the aperture of the cone.\n Oval or  A decorative screw head with a countersunk bottom and rounded top. Also known as \"raised countersunk\" in the UK.\n  Similar to countersunk, but there is a smooth progression from the shank to the angle of the head, similar to the bell of a bugle.\n  Disc with cylindrical outer edge, height approximately half the head diameter.\n  Cylindrical, but with a slightly convex top surface. Height to diameter ratio is larger than cheese head.\n  A flanged head can be any of the above head styles (except the countersunk styles) with the addition of an integrated flange at the base of the head. This eliminates the need for a flat washer.\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.\n\ns \n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\nTools\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.\n\nThread standards\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.\n\nISO metric screw thread\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25\u00a0mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. \"M8\u00d71\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8\u00a0mm and advances by 1\u00a0mm per 360\u00b0 rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1\u00a0mm, is made by threading a 6\u00a0mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5\u00a0mm diameter (6\u00a0mm - 1\u00a0mm).\n\nMetric hexagon bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in International Standards ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\nWhitworth\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55\u00b0, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" UNC bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 respectively.\n\nBritish Association screw thread\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order\u2014it may be suspected\u2014to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6\u00a0mm diameter and 1\u00a0mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch \u00a0mm (0.65\u00a0mm) and diameter \u00a0mm (3.62\u00a0mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.\n\nUnified Thread Standard\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes  inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 \u00d7 number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 \u00d7 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112\u00a0inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought \u2013 seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 \u2013 (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.\n\nManufacture\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n\nThe blanks are then polished again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via thread rolling; however, some are cut. The workpiece is then tumble finished with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing. For most screws, a coating, such as electroplating with zinc (galvanizing) or applying black oxide, is applied to prevent corrosion.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile a recent hypothesis attributes the Archimedes' screw to Sennacherib, King of Assyria, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the Hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a Greek invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath Archimedes.  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.\n\nEarlier, the screw had been described by the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum (428\u2013350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.\n\nRybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, tournevis) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and \"clinch bolts\" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees\u2014the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735\u20131800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771\u20131831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760\u20131800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. Standardization of threadforms began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near Philipsburg for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by \u201crolling and wire drawing apparatus\u201d from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. \n\nThe American development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was popularized by American Henry F. Phillips.\n\nThreadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.\n\nPrecision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution. They are key components of micrometers and lathes.\n\nOther fastening methods\nAlternative fastening methods are:\n\n nails\n rivets\n pins (dowel pins, taper pins, roll pins, spring pins, cotter pins)\n pinned shafts (keyed shafts, woodruff keys, gibb-headed key)\n screw bolt, pin bolt or cotter bolt, and clench bolt- as used in clinker boat building\n welding\n soldering\n brazing\n joinery (mortise & tenon, dovetailing, box joints, lap joints)\n gluing\n taping\n clinch fastening\n\nSee also\n\n Bolted joint\n Dowel\n Fastener\n Gender of connectors and fasteners\n Syndesmotic screw\n Tap and die\n Die head\n Thread angle\n Threaded fastener\n Threaded insert\n Threaded rod (e.g. studs, allthread)\n Threading\n Thread-locking compound\n Thread pitch gauge\n Wall plug\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n How the World Got Screwed\n NASA-RP-1228 Fastener Design Manual\n Imperial/Metric fastening sizes comparison\n \"Hold Everything\", February 1946, ''Popular Science\" article section on screws and screw fastener  technology developed during World War Two\n How to feed screws and dowels\n\nMetalworking\n \nWoodworking\nArticles containing video clips", "machine_text": " Screw is an integral part of any mechanical system, used in myriad applications ranging from fastening and tightening to drilling, cutting, and lifting. A screw is basically an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. The cone-shaped thread that winds along the outside of the screw is what gives it its mechanical advantage. Screws are composed of two distinct parts, the thread, which is the helical ridge, and the head, which is on the wider end of the screw. The thread\u2019s primary purpose is to help the screw move through material; the head is used to help manipulate and secure the screw. On the head of the screw there is a distinct shape, such as a flat head, Phillips head, hex head, or other shapes. The shape of the head is used to help with the application of controlled torque in driving the screw, and the shape helps to prevent slippage when the screw is tightened. Screws come in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, glass, and drywall. Metal screws are often made of brass, steel, aluminum, or stainless steel, while plastic screws are often made of nylon or phenolic. These materiels are chosen to suit specific applications, as each material offers different advantages for certain tasks. Screws are generally measured in diameter, with metric measurements expressed in millimeters, and imperial measurements typically expressed in inches. The length of a screw is measured from the tip to the base. Standard metric screws generally range from small sizes like 3mm up to large sizes such as 16mm. Imperial screws range from small sizes like #2 up to large sizes such as 2 inches (50.8mm). Screws are used in all sorts of applications, including fastening, securing, and joining wood, metal, plastic, and other materials. This versatility makes them one of the most commonly used mechanical components. In fact, the average car has around 3,000 screws holding it together. Their importance in modern technology and engineering cannot be overstated. Throughout history, the screw has been utilized in various ways, from Archimedes\u2019 screw pump invented in the 3rd century BC to Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s screw machine drawn in the 16th century. It wasn\u2019t until the 17th century, however, that screws were manufactured on an industrial level. Today, the screw is ubiquitous in our lives and is an essential fastener in everyday materials, products, and machines. From the simplest doorknob to the most complicated robotics; from furniture to aircraft, screws remain as essential components in modern industry and technology.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20691673}

Beer studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London and later obtained his Masters in Fine Art from the Royal College of Art in London. Beer's works often explore abstract concepts and consider the subjective experience of space. Through his work, Beer attempts to create a \"continuum of sensory awareness\". He is interested in decay and transformation and his works often center around considering the same phenomena from multiple perspectives. Beer has been widely exhibited internationally, including exhibitions at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, Documenta 14 in Athens, and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. He was awarded the 2018 Prix Lafayette and was shortlisted for both the 2019-2020 Prix Marcel Duchamp and 2019 Turner Prize. Beer has used sound to transform spaces and explore the physical and psychological effects of sound. His installations often span multiple rooms, and various sounds are layered upon one another to form complex, site specific pieces. Some of his best-known works include \u2018Vessel Orchestra\u2019 at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle, \u2018Voice Resonance Chamber\u2019 at the Tate Britain, and \u2018Collapseland\u2019 at the Fridericianum in Kassel. In 2019, Beer participated in an Antarctica Expedition with Cape Farewell, a non-profit organization working to increase awareness and action around climate change. The expedition wanted to explore the relationship between the human experience of an extreme environment and the natural world, and during the expedition Beer composed an album of the sounds he experienced and recorded. Outside of his visual art practice, Beer has works as a composer, singer and music producer with releases on labels such as Warp Records. He has collaborated with many artists and was commissioned by the Royal Albert Hall and Ballet Black to create original music for 'The Concealed' performance in 2019. Beer is currently based in London and continues to explore new ways of working and materials. His work has been widely reviewed in publications such as Frieze, Art Monthly, and The Guardian.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42334249}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Koupaki, Phocis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Koupaki or Koupakio (Greek: \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 or \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) is a Greek village in the municipal unit of Vardousia, located in the northwestern part of Phocis, west of the Mornos dam and 5\u00a0km from Krokyleio, the former seat of Vardousia. Population: 65 (2011 census). In recent years, very few remain during winter months but over 200 during summer months.\n\nGeography \n\nMuch of the area is mountainous, forested (oaks and pines) and pastureland suitable for livestock production, although in earlier times mixed livestock and crop cultivation was extensively practiced. The village lies on the east-facing side of colline Pyrgos. A couple of small streams pass through the village but are dry most of the year except during the rainy winter season.  At over  altitude, it gets snow nearly every winter but overall the village enjoys mild winters and a very attractive climate year round.\n\nHistory \n\nBased on historical accounts from the greater area, Koupaki was inhabited before 2000 B.C. by the Pelasgians, who were then invaded by the Dorians whose presence for a long time gave the name Dorida to the greater region. The Aetolians followed from the 13th century B.C. onwards and the area was later invaded by Achaeans, Macedonians, Galatians, Romans and Goths culminating with the destruction of the ancient city of Doris. Later, it was the turn of the Slavs, the Bulgarians, the Catalans, Normans and finally the Ottoman Turks, with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 A.D.\n\nUntil about 200 A.D. religious beliefs in the greater area were dominated by idol worshiping and polytheism. The Oracle of Delphi exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world as a source of wise counsel or prophetic opinion, usually spiritual in nature. It is of no surprise that Christianity could not easily match the infallible authority of the oracle and it is said that it took over 100 years for the region to accept the new dogma.\n\nFor nearly 400 years under Ottoman occupation, poor and mountainous villages like Koupaki were not favorite places for the Turks. However, a location near Koupaki which is known as Maraveli was at some period during the Ottoman occupation the \"property\" of a Turk with the likely name Omar Avel or Abel (from whom the area apparently took its name).  It is said that the Maraveli area was used as pastureland for livestock to supply the needs of the Turk who resided in one of the larger towns of the Mornos valley to the south, as the Turks preferred wealthier and more fertile areas as well as the security and social structure offered by larger towns. In fact, this relative isolation and ethnic purity of mountainous people like Koupaki brought with it pride and a sense of purity and superiority relative to those of the lowlands. Although the latter had no alternative but to cohabitate with the Turks, this was considered as capitulation and as shameful compromise by the mountainous people.\n\nThe Greek War of Independence in 1821  against the Ottoman Turks found the rugged mountainous villages in the forefront of the revolution. On October 1828 Dorida was finally liberated and the province of Sterea Hellas (literally the 'Solid Greece') together with the Peloponnese in the south comprised the new Greek Nation.   In 1837, less than 10 years after liberation, Koupaki was recognized as an independent community by the Greek government and became part of the municipality of Krokyleion. Koupaki is referred to as a distinct community for the first time around 1800 by the French Historian and traveler Charles Pouqueville, who refers to the village as Copaki.\n\nThe present location of the village formed the nucleus for smaller settlements around it.  Slowly the inhabitants of these peripheral settlements moved to the main central village location.  In addition, starting around 1830 the village saw an influx of people from the area around the town of Missolonghi, to the west of Sterea Hellas. The town's heroic resistance to the Turks, who besieged it twice both from the sea and land in the mid-1820s, became a legend. The descriptions of heroism from the besieged city moved all Greeks, including Koupaki, to open their welcoming arms; but it also reached far away places and several world personalities of the time came to the town's rescue. Among them was the acclaimed British poet Lord Byron, who fought and died in  Missolonghi in 1826. The few from  Missolonghi who survived the daring exodus in 1826, took to the mountains and several arrived at Koupaki and other villages of Dorida. Some of the newcomers from  Missolonghi actually originated from the region of Epirus, a ragged mountainous region in the north-west of Greece. They had moved south into the province of Sterea Hellas, already fighting for its independence, in order to assist the war and breath the first air of freedom.\n\nBy 1845 the construction of the main village church had started, exclusively with the local gray stone and oak beams.  This work was completed by means of personal voluntary labour offered by men and women. The engravings seen today on cornerstones of the church are still immensely inspiring. They reflect deep spirituality and a tribute to the institution that preserved Orthodoxy and the Greek language and culture for almost 400 years.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, a large number of young men from Koupaki headed for the New World.  Many of them worked in building the railway network in America, others served in the restaurant business, a tradition that lasted for a long time.  They left with the intention to return but many of them never did and many more from their extended family and friends followed their path.  This was the beginning of the gradual decay of the village which accelerated further during the 1920s and 1940s with new destinations such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe people \n\nFamily names in Koupaki, as elsewhere in rural Greece and beyond, were formed by a combination of the father's first name (e.g. Panos) and the offspring's own name (e.g. Kostas). So the offspring would be known as Panokostas and this would often be adopted as the family name for that branch of the family. Similarly, Mitros an offspring of Giannis would go by the name Giannomitros, etc. If the father was more prominent in the community and known as a craftsman or held an official position, the father's trade could often become the first part of the family name e.g. for a priest (Papas in Greek) carrying the name Andreas, the family name would become Papandreas.   Finally, physical characteristics would also play a role in giving family names. For example, if Andreas happened to be relatively short (Kontos in Greek), his family name could become Kontoandreas (hence, the origin of the family name Konandreas). At Koupaki there were about 5-6 original families with these long composite family names who formed the nucleus of the village. Those were the families of Giannomitros, Kolimparis, Konandreas, Koufasimes, Nasiopoulos and Tsatouhas. Those who came from Messologi and Epirus after 1826, had two-syllable names e.g. Goumas, Nitsos, Soulias, Tsipras, Zohos, Zoupas, Zakkas etc.\n\nThe two World Wars and the Greek Civil War, following World War II, took a great toll on Koupaki, both in terms of life lost and material destruction.  From 329 inhabitants in 1940, only 187 had remained in 1951, partly as a result of war casualties and partly due to immigration. The village was never to regain its old past and by the end of the 1950s and 1960s, most of those that had remained left for the cities (mainly Athens). By the 1970 census, only 51 inhabitants were registered. All along, education was seen as the only real escape from the hardships of village life and most families sacrificed everything to see their children finishing school and entering university. This has not been in vain; Koupaki has one of the highest per capita university graduates in Greece.\n\nThe village has never lost the hearts and minds of its people wherever they may be and many of them (including from far away places such as California and New Zealand) converge to it, especially during the summer months, to remember the past and enjoy the fresh mountain air. Most of the houses, stone-built, have been renovated to benefit from modern amenities.  The village was connected to the regional road network in 1952 (dirt road) which was paved asphalt in the 1990s.  Electricity reached the village in the 1970s and the 1970s brought also individual telephone connection (until then the village was served by a single telephone located in the main grocery store in the centre of the village).\n\nKoupaki has a beautiful church (Agios Georgios) and had a functioning elementary school until it closed in 1957 (because of the limited number of students who then were obliged to attend school at the nearby village of Zorianos). The school is now used as a museum for local arts and crafts. Koupaki is the birthplace of prominent individuals who excelled in the sciences, public life, international organizations and in business.\n\nContemporary news about Koupaki are printed in the quarterly 'To Koupaki mas' (Greek: \u03a4\u03bf \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2) published by the Koupaki community in Athens and distributed to the four corners of the world. News about Koupaki can also be found in the village website (in Greek). The village is  featured in the book \"Better Dead Than Divorced: The Trial of Panayota\" by  Lukas Thanasis Konandreas which describes the murder of his father's cousin Panayota Nitsos by her abusive husband in the 1950s and her family's efforts to bring the murderers to justice. The book won the 2015 Bronze Nonfiction Book Award.\n\nPopulation of Koupaki over time\n\nReferences \n\nPopulated places in Phocis", "machine_text": " Koupaki (Greek: \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9) is a seaside village in the Phocis region of central Greece. It is located on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Corinth, approximately 12 km south of Delphi and 4 km west of Galaxidi. In antiquity, the area surrounding the present-day village was known as Erineos, named after the eponymous ancient greek city located on the promontory of the same name, which is now an uninhabited plateau between Koupaki and Galaxidi. Koupaki has been inhabited continuously since at least the Byzantine period, with some archaeological evidence for settlement as far back as the 2nd century AD. The modern village was founded in the 15th century by Greek fishermen from northwest Peloponese. It has since grown to around 1000 inhabitants, mainly engaged in tourism and fishing. The village itself consists of two main settlements, the larger of which is built along the sand covered shoreline, and a smaller one of seasonal dwellings further up the hill. It's characterized by narrow cobblestone pathways, old stone churches and traditional white-washed houses. The port of Koupaki is the main economic activity of the village, serving fishing vessels, sailing boats and small ferries that link the area to Delphi and Galaxidi. There are also several cafes and small restaurants which serve traditional greek specialities. Koupaki is popular with tourists looking to explore the nearby archaeological sites, including Delphi and Erineos. It is also a popular spot for sunbathing among locals and tourists alike, as well as a hub for water sports activities. In the late spring, Koupaki is the setting for the Pan-Hellenic triathlon, comprising of a 2000 meter swim in the gulf, a 15 km bike ride and a 5 km run around the village and the surrounding hillsides. The event has been held every year since 1993. Koupaki is also known for its picturesque sunsets, which are visible from the beach and nearby promontories. The postcard view of the setting sun and the small boats silhouetted against the horizon has become well known amongst travelers. Today, Koupaki has become an ideal destination for rural Greek tourism, offering a plethora of activities for visitors, such as bicycle tours, sailing trips, activities on the beach and nearby archaeological sites. The village also boasts a variety of traditional guesthouses, small family hotels and apartment rentals. Koupaki is well connected to the nearby cities and villages of Delphi, Galaxidi, Amfissa and Itea via public buses, as well as the sea port of Agios Konstantinos. There are also daily ferry services to the island of Evia. ", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20263826}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"When God Writes Your Love Story\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships is a 1999 book by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage.

The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.\n\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nOther American Christian authors, such as Mark Matlock and Jason Evert, wrote highly of When God Writes Your Love Story. Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared When God Writes Your Love Story to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating, including Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. Eastern University Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story,\" in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible.\n\nBackground\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story, first published in the United States in 1999,  is the third book written by Eric and Leslie Ludy, an American married couple. Like the Ludys' previous two books, His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship (1996) and Romance God's Way (1997), its major themes are romance and Christianity; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, courtship, and marriage. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, When God Writes Your Love Story was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009. Translations of the book have been published in Spanish, German, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nEric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a friendship for several months before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but to wait for the life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.\n\nBefore the book's release, it was endorsed by Leslie and Les Parrott, authors of Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts; Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps. The first edition was packaged with a CD single by the Ludys: \"Faithfully\", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.\n\nContent\nThe book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, \"Desiring a Love Story\", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, \"Preparing for a Love Story\", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, \"Waiting for a Love Story\", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, \"Sweetening a Love Story\", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, \"Discovering a God-written Love Story\", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.\n\nEarly in the book, Eric retells a portion of Homer's Odyssey, describing the episode in which Ulysses sails near the land of the Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a \"sweeter song\" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the \"sweeter song\" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is \"the beautiful side of love\"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.\n\nThe Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, \"if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry\u00a0... is alive and wandering the earth\" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of \"true love\" as an emotion; instead, they define \"true love\" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that \"there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied\u00a0... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others\u00a0... our deepest needs are met as well!\"\n\nLeslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question \"How will I know when a relationship is from God?\" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a \"team\u00a0... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective.\" She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.\n\nCritical response\n\nDiscussions of context\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl. When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns, and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and \"desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks.\" Gardner argues that the result \"was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending.\"\n\nIn the journal Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago writes that the Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.\n\nChristian responses to the book's advice\n\nChristine A. Col\u00f3n and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties, expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Col\u00f3n, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that \"the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God\" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Col\u00f3n and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states \"the more delay'd, delighted.\" Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.\n\nCol\u00f3n and Field compare When God Writes Your Love Story to Derek Prince's God Is a Matchmaker, and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their soulmates quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Col\u00f3n and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so tests one's faith and that \"God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose.\"\n\nMargaret and Dwight Peterson, an American married couple who are Christian Studies professors at Eastern University, teach a course together called \"Christian Marriage\" and were very critical of When God Writes Your Love Story. They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called \"God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story.\" They write therein that, while they read When God Writes Your Love Story, \"it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage.\" In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of Disney Princesses, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. While referencing When God Writes Your Love Story specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that \"it is the entire genre that is problematic.\"\n\nRick Holland, an instructor at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.\n\nWhen God Writes Your Love Story was received positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story in his book If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.\n\nCommentators have also noted the song \"Faithfully\" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse. On the other hand, in Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity, Brienne Murk, a Christian musician and public speaker, identifies \"Faithfully\" as one of her favourite songs.\n\nIn 22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story, Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of When God Writes Your Love Story, she stopped because \"it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together \u2014 because it wasn't happening for me.\" She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be \"mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples.\"\n\nIn 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis pregnancy center operated by Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles \u2014 Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n Ellerslie, official website of Eric and Leslie Ludy\n\n1999 non-fiction books\n1999 in Christianity\n1999 in the United States\n20th-century Christian texts\nAmerican non-fiction books\nBooks about spirituality\nChristian devotional literature\nChristian theology books\nDating\nEnglish-language books\nEvangelicalism in the United States\nCollaborative non-fiction books\nMarriage in Christianity\nRandom House books\nSexual abstinence and religion\nNon-fiction books about sexuality\nSexuality in Christianity\nYoung adult non-fiction books", "machine_text": " When God Writes Your Love Story is a book written by authors Eric and Leslie Ludy.

They advise readers to stay away from short-term pleasures that may otherwise be found in the modern world, instead encouraging them to wait patiently on God while He creates \"His lasting love story.\" In this book, the Ludys outline God's ideals, advice, and expectations of relationships, referencing Bible verses along the way. While some readers may take Eric and Leslie Ludy\u2019s advice to heart, others may disagree with their views. For example, some disagree with their view that finding the right partner should always come first. They believe that an individual must prioritize personal relationships with God over any other, and that God is the only one who truly knows when and who the perfect partner will be. The messages encouraged in When God Writes Your Love Story include wisdom and knowledge that can help single Christians in their search for lasting relationships. They address the common mistakes made in modern dating, which can often lead to unhealthy or unhappy results. They urge readers to follow biblical principles and trust in God for guidance. When God Writes Your Love Story has sold over one million copies. It was such a success that Eric and Leslie decided to follow up their first book with When Dreams Come True, which was published in 2005.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Continental collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In geology, continental collision is a phenomenon of plate tectonics that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth.\n\nContinental collision is not an instantaneous event, but may take several tens of millions of years before the faulting and folding caused by collisions stops. The collision between India and Asia has been going on for about 50\u00a0million years already and shows no signs of abating.  Collision between East and West Gondwana to form the East African Orogen took about 100\u00a0million years from beginning (610\u00a0Ma) to end (510\u00a0Ma). The collision between Gondwana and Laurasia to form Pangea occurred in a relatively brief interval, about 50\u00a0million years long.\n\nSubduction zone: the collision site\nThe process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries.  Oceanic crust is thin (~6\u00a0km thick) and dense (about 3.3\u00a0g/cm3), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45\u00a0km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5\u00a0g/cm3). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150\u00a0km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.\n\nDeep subduction of continental crust\nThe continental crust on the downgoing plate is deeply subducted as part of the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone.  An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic  coesite and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes.  The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90\u2013140\u00a0km deep.  Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie\u2013Sulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali.  Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes.  The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted.\n\nOrogeny and collapse\n \nAn orogeny is underway when mountains begin to grow in the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision is one of the most important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1\u00a0mm/year, a 5,000\u00a0m tall mountain can form in 5\u00a0million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust begins to flow and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and  the two continents are completely sutured.  Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent. \n\nThe pace of mountain building associated with the collision is measured by radiometric dating of igneous rocks or units that have been metamorphosed during the collision and by examining the record of sediments shed from the rising mountains into the surrounding basins.  The pace of ancient convergence can be determined with paleomagnetic measurements, while the present rate of convergence can be measured with GPS.\n\nFar-field effects \nThe effects of the collision are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea and away from the collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.\n\nFossil collision zones\n\nContinental collisions are a critical part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called \"suture zones\" by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or sutured together.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nWhere Continents Collide\nDynamics of Continental Collision Zones\nThe Wilson Cycle\n\nPlate tectonics", "machine_text": " Continental collision is a geological process in which two tectonic plates composed primarily of continental crust come into contact and collide with one another. It is one of several ways of forming mountain ranges, and is most often associated with the collision of two large land masses, but can also occur due to a continental plate colliding with a smaller fragment of continental crust, such as an island arc or microcontinent. Due to the extreme forces at work during such collisions, the colliding continents and the areas around them are often highly deformed and may form fold belts, volcanoes and large faults. Continental collision typically occurs where two continental plates meet, either head-on or obliquely. When two large, continental plates collide head-on, one of the plates is typically subducted, or pushed underneath the other. This creates a mountain range, such as the Himalaya and the Andes mountains. When an oceanic plate and a continental plate meet, they do not usually collide, but instead, the oceanic plate will become subducted beneath the continental plate. In some cases, the edges of the two continental plates may slide past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary and results in a laterally displaced mountain range, such as the Rocky Mountains in the United States, as well as several other mountain ranges in western North America and other parts of the world. Most continental collisions cause large earthquakes and can also trigger volcanic activity, although this is not always the case. During the collision of two continental plates, the crust of each plate becomes crumpled and folded, forming mountains and shallow basins. This can result in the formation of rift valleys, and in some cases, mountain ranges such as the Himalaya, the Alps, the Andes and the Appalachian Mountains, which were all created by continental collisions. Continental collisions are responsible for some of the most dramatic landscapes and geological features on Earth, and are therefore of great interest to geologists and other scientists. There have been many continental collisions throughout Earth's nearly four-and-a-half billion year history and many more still to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2076436}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pebble Mine\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pebble Mine  is the common name of a proposed copper-gold-molybdenum mining project in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska, near Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark. As of November 2020 the mine developer, Northern Dynasty Minerals, was seeking federal permits from the United States Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. State permitting would then follow, which the developer expected to take up to three years. In November 2020, the developer was denied a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permit for its proposed mine discharge plan. On September 9, 2021, it was reported that the EPA had \"asked a federal court to allow for Clean Water Act protections for parts of the bay.\"\n\nBackground\n\nGeography \nThe Pebble prospect is in a remote, wild, and generally uninhabited part of the Bristol Bay watershed. The nearest communities, about  distant, are the villages of Nondalton, Newhalen, and Iliamna. The site is  southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nPebble is approximately  north of, and upstream of, Lake Iliamna. The deposit area is characterized by relatively flat land dotted by glacial ponds, interspersed with isolated mountains or ranges of hills rising one or two thousand feet above the flats. Pebble is under a broad flat valley at about  above sea level dividing the drainages of Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River.\n\nUpper Talarik Creek flows into Lake Iliamna, which flows through the Kvichak River into Bristol Bay. Waters in the Koktuli River drain into the Mulchatna River, a tributary of the Nushagak River which empties into Bristol Bay at Dillingham. Water from Lake Clark, approximately  east of Pebble, flows down the Newhalen River to Lake Iliamna.\n\nGeology\n\nRegional \nThe Kahiltna terrane is interpreted to represent a sediment trough formed on the landward (Alaska) side of the Wrangellia volcanic arc terrane, prior to collision of Wrangellia with Alaska. The Wrangellia and Kahiltna terranes docked to Alaska in the Cretaceous Period. This part of the Kahiltna terrane is dominated by Late Triassic basalt, andesite and sedimentary rocks overlain by Jurassic-Cretaceous andesitic turbidites. Cretaceous granitic intrusive activity was widespread in the Kahiltna terrane. Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and Quaternary glacial deposits, developed over the older rocks.\n\nThe Lake Clark fault, or a splay, probably lies within  of the Pebble deposits and possibly much closer. The fault is a major right-lateral strike-slip crustal feature, considered to be a westward expression of the Castle Mountain fault. The actual ground trace of the fault and its splays are unknown in the Pebble area, due to extensive ground cover. A 2007 report indicates that magnitude 7.1 quakes occur on the fault on a 700-year cycle. The Lake Clark fault several hundred miles to the north is sub-parallel to the Denali fault and considered to be of similar nature. A magnitude 7.9 quake struck the Denali fault in 2002.\nThe subduction zone of the Aleutian Trench lies approximately  south of Pebble. This zone was the source of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake of magnitude 9.2. The Augustine Volcano, which lies 25 miles offshore, last erupted in 2006.\n\nThe ore body \nA contiguous body of ore is known as Pebble West where mineralization locally extends to the surface and as Pebble East where it is deeply buried. Pebble holds mostly low-grade ore, requiring a large-scale operation to economically recover it.\n\nThe Pebble deposit is hosted in porphyritic granodiorite to tonalite of Upper Cretaceous age intruded into deformed sedimentary rocks of the Jurassic to Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch terrane.\n\nThe copper ore is a calc-alkali porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit. The ore body extends from the surface to at least  depth. In the western part of the orebody, mineralization occurs in a complex of several small granodiorite cupolas, diorite sills, older intrusions, breccias, and sediments. The western part of the deposit is locally exposed at the surface; thin gossans are developed and oxidation reaches  in depth. The orebody extends eastward across a fault contact, at depth. East of the fault mineralization occurs in abundant sills and in the intruded sediments. Farther east, and deeper, the sills coalesce into a deeply buried granodiorite pluton. Mineralization and ore continue into the pluton. The eastern part of the deposit was eroded when it was exposed at the surface millions of years ago. It has since been buried by a thickening-to-the-east wedge of post-mineralization-age Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic sedimentary rocks.\n\nMineralization at Pebble is aged from 90.4 \u00b10.6 MYA to 89.5 \u00b10.3 MYA.\n\nMetallic minerals identified at Pebble include pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and bornite, along with minor covellite, chalcocite, digenite and magnetite.\n\nResources \nIn 2008, Pebble was estimated to be the second-largest ore deposit of its type in the world in terms of the value of the contained metal, slightly smaller than Indonesia's Grasberg Mine, which contains more metal in a smaller amount of ore than Pebble.\n\nThe last resource estimate for Pebble, as at December 2017, was a measured and indicated resource of 6.46 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.40% copper, 0.34 g/t gold, 1.7 g/t silver and 240 ppm molybdenum. Contained metals in the resource (at 100% recovery) were 56.9 billion pounds of copper, 70.6 million troy ounces of gold, 3.4 billion pounds of molybdenum and 344 million ounces of silver. The estimate used a 0.3% copper equivalent cutoff. \n\nAs of August 2021 gross value of the contained metals, 57% was from copper, and 27% from gold and 14% from molybdenum. Co-products including silver, rhenium, and palladium might also be recoverable.\n\nFisheries \nAll five Eastern Pacific salmon species spawn in Bristol Bay's freshwater tributaries. The bay is home to the world's largest commercial sockeye salmon fishery. The Kvichak River has the world's single largest sockeye run. The Kvichak drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Salmon, herring and other fisheries account for nearly 75% of local jobs.\n\nSport fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater for sport fishermen exploiting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).\n\nSeasonal harvesting of salmon and year-round harvesting of freshwater fish is a critical part of life for rural residents, most of whom live downstream of the mine site.\n\nHuman populations \nThe Pebble site is within Lake and Peninsula Borough, about 1,600 inhabitants as of United States Census, 2010, adjacent to the Bristol Bay Borough of about 1000 inhabitants and the Dillingham Census Area, 4,800 inhabitants. Some 7,500 people live largely rural lifestyles within or near the area downstream of the Pebble site. The populations of Lake Clark National Park and other parts of the Bethel Census Area are upstream of the site or in a different watershed.\n\nThe populations in the area rely heavily on wild resources for subsistence, harvesting moose, caribou and salmon. Wild resources play an important part in the region's cultural heritage. There are more than 30 Alaskan native tribes in the region that depend on salmon to support their traditional subsistence ways of life, in addition to other inhabitants and tourists in the area.\n\nHistory\n\nDiscovery \nIn 1987 Cominco Alaska Exploration (CAE) (which subsequently became Teck Resources) collected mineralized surface samples at the Pebble site from color anomalies visible from aircraft. Geologist Phil St. George was credited with the discovery. He led early exploration efforts, drilling out the first half billion tons of the deposit. The first two exploration holes were drilled in 1988; in 1989 twelve more drill holes, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys indicated that the Pebble West occurrence (originally named Pebble Beach) was part of a large copper porphyry system. CAE continued drilling and other work through 1992, with a second drill campaign in 1997, with the resource doubled from 500M short tons to 1B short tons. \n\nIn 2001, Northern Dynasty Minerals, Ltd. optioned the property from Teck Cominco, the successor to CAE's parent company. Northern Dynasty Minerals began exploration in 2002, which continued through 2013. In 2005, Northern Dynasty discovered the Pebble East deposit and acquired 100% ownership of the Pebble mining claims.\n\nProject funding \n\nIn 2008, $140 million was budgeted and approximately  of additional drilling was completed.\n\nIn 2009, $70 million was budgeted, to complete a preliminary feasibility study, or \"prefeasibility\" study, and to prepare the project for permitting.\n\nIn 2010, $73 million was budgeted towards the pre-feasibility report, environmental studies, and various administrative and community-relations work. Applications for development and operations permits were not planned until after 2010.\n\nFor 2011, $91 million was budgeted to complete the pre-feasibility study, leading to permit applications in 2012. Environmental and engineering studies including  of drilling to decide on mine design and a complete environmental baseline.\n\nProject particulars\n\nProject ownership \nThe land is owned by the State of Alaska. Pebble Mines Corp. holds mineral rights for  of the area, an area that includes the Pebble deposits, as well as other, less explored, mineral deposits. A sequence of mining companies and partnerships have owned the Alaska mining claims at and around Pebble since the initial claim staking by Cominco in 1987.\n\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership was once one of the largest multinational mining corporations made up of South African company Anglo American, along with Northern Dynasty Minerals, a junior mining company headquartered in Canada. After a few investors walked away, Northern Dynasty was the only company left seeking development.\n\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership is now 100% owned by The Northern Dynasty Partnership, which is a wholly owned Canadian-based subsidiary of Northern Dynasty Minerals, Limited.\n\nThree of the world's largest mining companies purchased shares of Northern Dynasty or became partners in the Pebble Limited Partnership through obligations to fund exploration and development. All have since divested their interests.\n\nMitsubishi Corporation sold its 9.1% interest in Northern Dynasty Minerals in 2011.\n\nAnglo American, a South African mining company, struck a deal with Northern Dynasty to earn a 50% interest in a newly created Pebble Limited Partnership, the other 50% belonging to Northern Dynasty; between 2007 and 2013 Anglo American spent over half a billion dollars on the project. In December 2013 Anglo American walked away from the project, losing its 50% interest, which reverted to Northern Dynasty Minerals Limited.\n\nRio Tinto Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Kennecott Utah Copper purchased, for 87 million dollars, a 9.9% ownership of Northern Dynasty Minerals Limited in July, 2006, and in 2007 doubled that to 19.8% ownership, for an additional 94 million dollars. In April 2014, the Rio Tinto Group gifted its shares, worth only approximately 18 million by then, to two Alaskan charitable foundations.\n\nNorthern Dynasty is one of several public mining companies controlled by Hunter Dickinson, a Vancouver-based Canadian mining corporation.\nAll but one of Hunter Dickinson Corporation's board members are also on the Northern Dynasty board. Most of the senior management of Northern Dynasty also hold senior management positions at Hunter Dickinson Corporation.\n\nAs reported on February 13, 2019, Kopernik Global Investors beneficially owns 6.17% of Northern Dynasty Minerals, which is an increase of 11% in their ownership stake from their prior reported position reported in February, 2018. Based on filings, Kopernik has held a position in NAK since at least as early as 2015, when they owned 19.99%.\n\nEconomics \nPebble is the largest known undeveloped copper ore body in the world, measured by either the amount of contained metal or the amount of ore.\n\nA report released by Northern Dynasty in 2011 predicted profits for mine owners from a large-scale open-pit mine at Pebble, given appropriate assumptions about construction costs ($4.7 billion), scale (200,000 tons per day), lifetime (45 years), metal prices over that lifetime (2011 prices) and the mine design plan.\n\nThe study assumed a slurry pipeline would deliver ore concentrate from the mine to a new port on Cook Inlet, and that trucks will haul ore concentrates to Cook Inlet.\n\nThe plan expected the mine to return the initial capital investment in 3.2 years, employ over a thousand people for the first 25 years and provide a lifetime 23.2% pretax internal rate of return. The expected pretax cash flow was approximately $2 billion per year for much of the mine life and significantly more during the later years. The report states that 58% of the ore resource will remain at year 45.\n\nPermits \nNorthern Dynasty has applied for water rights permits to Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River for use in mining. Altogether, Northern Dynasty has applied for rights to about  of ground and surface water per year, about four times the annual throughput of drinking-quality water at the Anchorage Waste and Wastewater Utility.\n\nIn April 2017 Northern Dynasty reported that it had received notice of approval of a Miscellaneous Land Use Permit from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for ongoing activities at Pebble.\n\nStudies \n\nSite-specific baseline data and scientific studies of potential environmental and social effects have been and are being conducted by the project operators and their consultants. These studies address water quality and other concerns. Among these are: \n quantification of Acid mine drainage - the chemical stability and weathering products of the tailings (waste rock, which would be wet-stacked without dewatering) generated by the mine, as well as of the newly exposed and blast-fractured rocks within the proposed mine.\n seismic risks to the impoundment systems (earthen tailings dams) designed to contain the tailings and intended to control their chemical behavior in perpetuity.\n the effects of road and bridge construction on fish habitat.\n\nPublic interest in the project has also resulted in outside, and opposing, interests publishing scientific reviews of available data and comparisons with other projects. These include reports or summaries on the following: acid rock drainage, effects of roads and bridges on fish (roads supporting the Pebble mine could cross 20 known salmon streams), and general water pollution-related concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began conducting a scientific review of the Bristol Bay watershed in 2011 focused on the Nushagak and Kvichak river drainages, in response to petitions from tribes, commercial fishing organizations, and other organizations opposed to Pebble. The agency completed the review in 2014. See Legal challenges.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) released its final Environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Pebble Mine project in July 2020, concluding that the project would not lead to \"long-term changes in the health of the commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay,\" under normal conditions. After a preliminary draft of this final statement was sent to federal and state agencies, many other scientific and administrative groups critiqued this conclusion. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that the EIS did not consider habitat destruction that could lead to destruction of salmon stocks in Bristol Bay. The legal director of Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit public interest law firm, indicated that the report was \"lacking and thoroughly inadequate.\"\n\nPossible mining plan \nThe mine itself would be an open-pit mine a mile square in area and a third of a mile deep. Ponds would be dammed to contain tailing, including some toxic materials. A 165-mile natural gas pipeline would be constructed to provide power for the operation, as well as 80 miles of road and pipeline to transport the mined concentrate to Cook Inlet. Operating the mine would use and impound large amounts of surface water. The roads would carry fuel, industrial chemicals and supplies.\n\nPebble East would most likely be an underground mine.\n\nPebble would be similar to existing large copper porphyry mines such as Chuquicamata, Bingham Canyon and Ok Tedi, although the environmental setting and various technical considerations of Pebble distinguish it from these desert and tropical examples. Development and construction would consume years and cost billions of dollars. Required infrastructure includes miles of roads, bridges and power lines with pipelines for fuel and rock slurries.\n\nDesign possibilities include: construction of a port on Iniskin Bay of Cook Inlet with a two-lane freight road roughly  long built along the north side of Lake Iliamna between the mine and the new port; trucks hauling ore concentrate to the port; pipelines along the road to carry fuel to the mine and a slurry of metal concentrate to the port. The slurry would be dewatered at the port before being shipped to a smelter, with a pipeline returning the water to the mine. Power to operate the mine would possibly come from a combination of overhead power lines and a submarine cable across Cook Inlet.\n\nFeasibility studies (detailed mine construction and operation plans) were prepared by Pebble Mines Corp. The company expected to apply for permits in 2012 at the earliest.\n\nProject timeline \n2010: Nine Bristol Bay Tribes, commercial fishermen, and sportsmen requested the EPA conduct a Section 404c Environmental Assessment study under the Clean Water Act. EPA describes the study process: \"Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in water of the United States (including wetlands) whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that use of such sites for disposal would have an unacceptable adverse impact on one or more of various resources, including fisheries, wildlife, municipal water supplies, or recreational areas.\"\n\n2012: EPA issued two drafts of the Environmental Assessment, concluding that the proposal for the Pebble Mine would negatively impact the Bristol Bay salmon. The public strongly agreed, with over 1 million comments supporting the EPA\u2019s findings and scientists further verifying the data.\n\n2013: The Alaska DNR signed and adapted a Determination of Reclassification and Plan Amendment to the Bristol Bay Area Plan. This plan increased the amount of land classified Wildlife Habitat and Public Recreation in the region.\n\nThe final Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment (BBWA) was released, confirming that the Pebble Mine could not be operated without impacting Bristol Bay and harming salmon. In September 2013 Anglo American, one of the first and major investors in Pebble, withdrew from the project.\n\n2014: Rio Tinto gifted its stake in the project to the Alaska Community Foundation and the Bristol Bay Native Corporation Education Foundation.\n\n2015: EPA released its Proposed Determination suggesting to limit mining in the Bristol Bay region due to the irreversible and detrimental impacts it would have on the local salmon ecosystem. After its release, 89.5% of the country was in support of strong protections for Bristol Bay.\n\n2016: The Inspector General came out in support of the EPA\u2019s Watershed Assessment findings, ultimately encouraging limiting mining due to its unavoidable impact on the salmon wildlife in Bristol Bay, affecting both the natural ecosystem and the economic wellbeing of the area.\n\n2017: After a meeting between the EPA administration and the CEO of Northern Dynasty (developers for the Pebble Project), litigations are settled and the EPA agrees to begin proceedings to withdrawal the Proposed Determination act. Developers move forward with a plan for permits. In July, after the EPA proposes to withdrawal Proposed Determination, the Pebble Limited Partnership submits permits to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the key agency in charge of reviewing the permit, laid out in a 3-4 timeline. EPA decided to not withdraw the BBWA.\n\n2018: Due to increased input of concerns for the Bristol Bay fishery because of Pebble Project, EPA decides to suspend withdrawal of Proposed Determination. USACE decides to gather more information regarding the impact to area's fish and natural resources.\n\n2019: EPA submits comments to the USACE Environmental Impact Statement saying that the document underestimates the environmental impacts. More than 700,000 comments are posted in opposition to the Pebble Project. Later, the Proposed Determination is revoked, saying the five-year old document does not fully consider all information, including the Pebble Limited Partnership's project plan and the additional information considered during the USACE permit process.\n\n2020: In July, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found in a final environmental analysis that the operation of a Pebble Mine \"would not be expected to have a measurable effect on fish numbers\" in the Bristol Bay watershed. In November the Corps denied the project a permit for its discharge plan, required under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. In 2020, while campaigning for the presidency of the US, Joe Biden stated the location was \"no place for a mine.\" In January 2021, Northern Dynasty Minerals  submitted an appeal to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decision. \n\n2021: On September 9, 2021, it was reported that the EPA, calling the bay an \"Alaskan treasure,\" had \"asked a federal court to allow for Clean Water Act protections for parts of the bay. If the court agrees, the agency could move forward with designing long-term protections for the bay.\" The EPA restoring protections would, according to the Washington Post, essentially block the mine project. Apparently, the EPA had only used authority under \"Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to block a major project only a dozen other times.\" Before implemented, the decision awaiting signing off by the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, potentially a several month process.\n\nReactions \nThe proposed Pebble mine centers poses a potential risk to the watershed, salmon and other fisheries. Mining opponents claim that the mine poses a significant and unacceptable risk to downstream fish stocks, and could cause an environmental disaster if built. Mining proponents claim that the mine can be developed and operated without significantly harming Bristol Bay area fish.\n\nA steady stream of electoral, legislative, and legal challenges to possible future Pebble mine development are lodged in Alaska. Some of these assert that even the drilling and other scientific investigations conducted to date have caused significant adverse effects to the land and wildlife near the Pebble site.\n\nPebble has been a major issue in Alaska politics since the mid-2000s; national environmental and sport-fishing organizations are involved, while national publications cover the issue.\n\nThe New York Times reports that, as of 2020, public opinion polls in Alaska indicate more opposition than support for the mine. In the local area near the proposed mine location, anti-mine sentiment is even stronger. In 2006 one poll reported 28% of Alaskans in favor of and 53% opposed to Pebble and another reported 45% of Alaskans in favor and 31% in opposition. A poll of Bristol Bay residents reported 20% in favor and 71% opposed. Fifty-seven percent of Alaskan voters in a 2008 statewide election voted against a ballot measure that would have essentially outlawed the project and perhaps similar developments elsewhere in Alaska.\n\nOrganizations including the Resource Development Council, Alaska Mining Association, and the Alaska Chamber of Commerce support the project. The proposal has strong support among statewide elected officials.\n\nOpposition to the proposal was led by organizations including; the Renewable Resources Coalition (formed in 2005 to oppose the Pebble project), local native groups (such as the Bristol Bay Native Association), commercial and sport fishing organizations (such as the Alaska Independent Fishermen's Marketing Association and the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism Association), and conservationist groups (such as American Rivers and Trout Unlimited). Deceased Senator Ted Stevens, a strong proponent of other resource extraction projects, in 2007 expressed opposition to the Pebble proposal.\n\nIn April 2009, a Native delegation from the Bristol Bay region attended the annual shareholder's meeting of Anglo American, the major mining company behind the Pebble project. The delegation met with Cynthia Carroll, CEO of Anglo American, claiming that the Bristol Bay watershed is no place for an open-pit mine.\n\nMultiple UK jewelers pledged not to buy gold from the Pebble mine if it is built, joining several American jewelry retailers and manufacturers who had done the same in 2008.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other well known groups and figures (such as actor Robert Redford) have opposed the construction of the mine. In an effort to stop or pause the construction of the mine, the NRDC has created a petition that now has more than a million signatures. The environmental justice nonprofit, Earthworks, has more than 100 gold buyers who have agreed to boycott gold from the Pebble Mine. These retailers include Tiffany & Co, Jostens, and Zales, along with others.\n\nArguments against the proposal \n Opponents to the mine point out that it is about jobs\u2014current sustainable fishing (world class fishery with long history and that is perpetually sustainable) versus the time-limited mining employment that the mine will generate.  (All mines have limited lifespans.) \n The fish in the watershed, and the wildlife that depend on them, are too important to risk in exchange for the mine's economic benefits. (Bristol Bay is the most valuable Sockeye Salmon fishery in the world \u2014  employing more than 14,000 people and generating $1.5 billion in annual profit.)\n Accidental discharge of process chemicals and byproducts, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage to the environment are concerns in mine design and operation.  Heavy metals are mobilized by acids.  Downstream salmon and freshwater fish species are vulnerable to mine-generated pollutants.  A threat to the fisheries would amount to a threat to the regional subsistence lifestyle.\n Hard-rock mining already has a notable track record in terms of the permanent and costly legacy of heavy-metal-laden acidic leachate that continuously flows from inactive, depleted old mine sites. According to the EPA, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40 percent of watersheds in the western continental U.S., and reclamation of 500,000 abandoned mines in 32 states could cost tens of billions of dollars.\n A recent study of 25 modern large hard-rock metal mines compared water quality outcomes with environmental impact statement (EIS) predictions from the permitting stage. 76 percent (19 mines) of the 25 mines violated water quality standards in releases to either surface or groundwater. In this study \"violated water quality standards\" does not necessarily mean that the mines failed to abide by their permits. When the 15 mines with high-acid drainage, high-contaminant leaching potential and proximity to ground water are considered separately, this number is 93% (14 mines).\n A report commissioned by opponents criticizes for community, worker safety, public health, and environmental problems at their mining operations in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Mali, Ireland, and Nevada and notes the difference between the previous owner's stated corporate goals and their actual corporate performance. (Anglo American gave up on Pebble Project due to environmental concerns; these concerns remain under the subsequent owners of the project.)\n\nEconomic \nDue to Alaska's tax structure, oil and gas drilling returns over 20% of resource value to the state and municipalities, fishing returns 1% to 5%, and mining returns approximately 1.5%. However, considering the mine contains over $500 billion in resources, this 1.5% tax amounts to a maximum of $7.5 Billion in tax revenue over the course of the mine's operation or $166 million/year or some four times the commercial tax budget in 2011 ($43 million). The annual revenue potential of the mine is yet unknown, and consequently so is the tax revenue to the State.\n\nArguments for the proposal\n\nEconomic \n The mine and supporting activities would provide significant tax revenue to the state. The State of Alaska predicts that direct mining tax revenue, even without Pebble, will be one of the most important sources of non-oil tax revenue (exceeding revenue from fishing).\n The mine will create well-paying jobs in an increasingly poverty-stricken region\u2014a 2007 estimate indicated roughly 2,000 jobs for construction, dropping to 1,000 permanent jobs during the 30- to 60-year expected lifespan of the mine. However, the current expected mine life has been decreased to 20 years following changes to the development plan in 2018.  Also, the recent and well-documented trend towards automation of mining means that actual employment figures will be substantially lower than those quoted in 2007.  Automation of mines will further increase in the future.\n The mine would provide a domestic resource of raw materials lowering the United States reliance on foreign sources.\n\nEnvironmental \n Protection of the environment and fisheries will be ensured by the stringent environmental review and permitting process, including an EIS, that is required before development is allowed.\n Much of the poor environmental track record of mining occurred before current technologies and regulations.\n Northern Dynasty has a \"no net loss\" policy for fisheries.\n\nSecretly taped conversations\nIn September 2020, the media reported that an environmental activist group, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an international NGO, while posing as potential investors in the mine had secretly taped conversations with Roland Thiessen, chief executive of Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Tom Collier, chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership. During the conversations Collier and Thiessen detailed their plans to gain the favor of elected politicians from Juneau to Washington, D.C. While the USACE had previously decided that the mine would have \"no measurable effect\" on fish populations, in August it informed Pebble Limited Partnership that they had to do more to show how they would offset the damage caused by the mining operation. The Washington Post wrote, \"...but even as the executives jump through several regulatory hoops, [...] they detailed their plan to manage all the decision-makers.\"\n\nThe Post wrote, \"Thiessen described both of the state\u2019s senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as politicians who might make noises about the project to appear sensitive to environmental concerns but ultimately won\u2019t stand in their way.\"  Referring to the letter the Corps issued in August, Collier was taped saying both senators had misinterpreted the letter and feeling \"embarrassed\" were \"[now] just sort of sitting over in a corner and being quiet, okay?\u201d  Learning of the tapes, Murkowski responded, \"Let me be clear: I did not misunderstand the Army Corps\u2019 recent announcement.  I am not 'embarrassed' by my statement on it, and I will not be 'quiet in the corner.' I am dead set on a high bar for large-scale resource development in the Bristol Bay watershed. The reality of this situation is the Pebble project has not met that bar and a permit cannot be issued to it.\" Sullivan also responded saying, \"Any suggestion otherwise is either wishful thinking, a blatant mischaracterization, or a desperate attempt to secure funding for a mine that cannot move forward. This incident demonstrates how far Mr. Collier, who has serious credibility problems of his own, is floundering in the face of this project\u2019s overwhelming challenges.\"  \n\nThe Post wrote that the tapes also revealed that Thiessen suggested that while the company was seeking a 20 year permit he outlined how it could last another 160 years. \"Once you have something like this in production why would you want to stop?\" In an interview, Senator Martin Heinrich said the tape raises questions about whether Pebble Mine officials misled Congress, saying, \"it really calls into question whether they were lying to Congress or not, which is a crime.\" In an interview, the executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency said, \"Seeing that the private opinion of that company that their massive plans will be unstoppable once the first artificially sized permit is passed, that is critical information for the public to know before the final decision is made because it clearly may have permanent impacts on an almost priceless resource for Alaska.\" Following the release of the tapes, Collier put in his resignation.\n\nThis controversy has impacted the 2020 United States Senate election in Alaska, during which Dan Sullivan is up for re-election. This recording and his campaign contributions from the Pebble Mine corporation has led observers to question the sincerity of his opposition to the project, potentially benefiting his political opponent Al Gross.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nEPA action \nOn December 18, 2009, an appeal was filed in Alaska Superior Court contending that a decision in November 2009 by the Alaska DNR commissioner rejecting their challenge of a 2009 exploration permit was inappropriate. The suit contended that DNR failed to give Alaskans adequate notice and opportunity to comment on the permit and that it failed to consider the appeal. Trustees for Alaska is pursuing the suit for Nunamta Aulukestai and two Bristol Bay residents.\n\nIn April 2013, EPA issued a draft assessment of the impact of proposed mining plans on the fisheries, wildlife and Alaska native tribes in the region.\n\nIn January 2014, EPA released its final assessment. It questioned the future of salmon habitat should the mine be opened, but the agency did not use its authority to stop the mine. Pebble Partnership CEO John Shively severely criticized the EPA assessment, saying it was unscientific and that it sought a predetermined outcome. A few days after the release, Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Begich openly opposed the mine, breaking with the other members of the Alaska congressional delegation, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and Republican Representative Don Young.\n\nIn July 2014, before the project had submitted its EIS, EPA's Region 10 office proposed restrictions pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, restrictions that would effectively prohibit the project. This was the twelfth time the clause had been employed since the Act's passage in 1972.\n\nOn July 18, 2014, in a published statement, Pebble Partnership CEO Tom Collier said that the project would continue its litigation against EPA; noted that the EPA's action was under investigation by the Office of the EPA Inspector General and by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and also noted that two bills were pending in the US House and Senate seeking to clarify that EPA did not have the authority to preemptively veto or otherwise restrict development projects prior to the onset of federal and state permitting. Collier's statement also said that EPA's proposal was based on outdated mining scenarios that were not part of the project's approach.\n\nIn May 2017 the Pebble Partnership and EPA jointly announced they had reached a settlement agreement to end the legal dispute regarding the EPA's Proposed Determination issued under CWA 404(c) in July 2014. The Agreement called for the EPA to withdraw the regulatory action while the Pebble Partnership agreed to terminate outstanding lawsuits brought against the EPA.\n\nIn July 2017, the EPA sought comments on a proposal to withdraw its objections to the Pebble Mine based on the 1974 Clean Water Act.\n\nIn February 2018, the EPA changed plans to withdraw restrictions on the Pebble Mine on the basis of the Clean Water Act. Instead, Administrator Pruitt offered support of the fishery. The decision is not final and is open to further public comments.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, the EPA withdrew its preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.\n\nNondalton Tribal Council et al. v. State of Alaska DNR \nSix federally recognized tribes filed Nondalton Tribal Council et al. v. State of Alaska DNR with the Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District) on May 5, 2009. The suit challenged the validity of the 2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan, one of many Area Plans created and administered by the State of Alaska that, along with other State and Federal rules, define land status and the appropriate and legal uses of State land within the plan boundaries.\n\nThe Bristol Bay Area Plan (BBAP) applies to about  of state-owned uplands and lands beneath rivers and lakes in the Bristol Bay drainages, including lands at and in the vicinity of the proposed mine. The plan also covers about  of state-owned tide and submerged lands.\n\nThe suit alleged that the 2005 BBAP, which replaced the original 1984 version, drastically altered, without legal justification, the land-use designations, classifications and acreages defined in the 1984 plan; and that the 2005 plan failed to provide adequate protection for subsistence resources, sport hunting and fishing, wildlife habitat and other renewable resources. If successful, the suit will require ADNR to write a new area plan, a many months-long process involving much public input and review of draft versions, although ultimately, approval of an area plan is decided by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, an appointee of the Governor. As of Aug. 7, 2009, DNR had not filed an answer to the complaint.\n\nNunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR \nNunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR, was filed in Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District) on July 29, 2009, by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Bristol Bay Native organization Nunamta Aulukestai, former Alaska First Lady Bella Hammond, original Alaska Constitutional Convention delegate Victor Fischer and other individuals. The suit seeks \"Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,\" asserting that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources repeatedly violated Section VIII of the Alaska Constitution, which specifically provides that there shall be, \"...no disposals or leases of state lands...without prior public notice and other safeguards of the public's interest...\"\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, an injunction voiding the project's existing permits, including water-use permits. The requested injunction was specific to Pebble permits and would not directly apply to other mining projects. The suit alleges that DNR's \"pattern of permitting,\" is defective because it was not sufficiently rigorous in determining that issuing a permit would best serve public interest, as demonstrated by a lack of documented scientific studies and by lack of public review and input, prior to issuing permits. A Declaration by one of the plaintiffs references the Commentary on Article VIII on State Lands and Natural Resources of December 15, 1955; \"As requirements change and many tasks become routine, appropriate modifications can be made in procedures if rigid requirements are not specified in the Constitution itself.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that significant, and documented, adverse effects on land, water, and wildlife have already occurred as a result of drilling and other exploration activities at Pebble since 1989.  In late 2009 the presiding judge rejected a State of Alaska motion to dismiss the case and also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop mining exploration. A Petition for Review on the preliminary injunction decision was filed with the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nIn July 2010, the Alaska Superior Court ruled that Nunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR would proceed to a non-jury trial in December 2010. The ruling dismissed one of the six claims in the lawsuit and limited the scope of the upcoming trial to the Pebble permits, rather than to the Alaska mineral exploration permitting system in general.\n\nPolitical actions \nTwo bills designed to outlaw large-scale mining in the Pebble area were introduced in the Alaska state legislature in 2007; both stalled in committee. A third attempted (by ballot measure) piece of legislation was the Alaska Clean Water Initiative, 2008. It was voted down after months of high-profile public debate, heavy advertising, and a series of judgements by the Alaska State Supreme Court. The measure remained an active public issue; in June 2009 the state of Alaska's Alaska Public Offices Commission reported violations of campaign funding laws during the contest.\n\nThen-Governor Sarah Palin was a strong supporter of the project and faced criticism about her opposition to the initiative, the involvement of state government and the intended use of a $7 million federal earmark to facilitate it. Ethics questions were raised about her and her husband Todd's participation.\n\nJay Hammond State Game Refuge \nA proposal to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to create a fish refuge in the Koktuli and Talarik watersheds was supported by mine opponents and opposed by Northern Dynasty. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted to create a panel to study the proposal (which could decide to recommend a refuge to the legislature). Both sides claimed this as a victory.  In March 2007 the Board voted to take no action on the proposal due to pending legislation.\n\nIn January, 2007 Senate Bill 67, introduced by Senator Gary Stevens, of Kodiak, proposed the establishment of a State Fish and Game Refuge covering about  of state land in the Kvichak and Nushagak drainages (with the refuge to be named after former Alaska Governor Jay Hammond). It proposed that no uses incompatible with: fish and wildlife populations; commercial or subsistence food gathering; or recreation would be allowed in the refuge. The bill sought to close the refuge to new mining claims. Most significantly, the bill would have made illegal the storage or disposal of any quantity of, \"industrial waste,\" thereby making it impossible to develop any industry, including mines, within the refuge. The bill died in the Senate Resources Committee.\n\nSalmon spawning waters \nIn February 2007, a bill to stop the project by increasing protections for spawning salmon died in the Human Resources committee.\n\n2008 Alaska Clean Water Initiative \n\nIn August 2008, Ballot Measure 4, the \"Alaska Clean Water Initiative,\" was voted down (approximately 57% against and 43% in favor) in that year's primary election. The measure was written to apply statewide (which the Constitution of Alaska demands). Supporters of the Measure argued that it would not affect any other mining operation. Opponents argued that it would have had serious, and unnecessary, adverse effects on the mining industry statewide.\n\nProperty rights \nPebble supporters argued that such bills and measures would constitute an illegal taking of property rights (mineral rights granted by the State of Alaska to holders of mining claims on state land).\n\nSee also\n Proposed Twin Metals mine (Ely, MN)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nGovernment links\n Pebble Project - Alaska Division of Mining, Land & Water\n\nOpposition\n Renewable Resources Coalition\n Renewable Resources Foundation\n Bristol Bay Native Corporation\n Nunamta Aulukestai-Caretakers of the Land\n Bristol Bay Residents Who Oppose the Mine\n Save Bristol Bay\n Our Bristol Bay\n Alaska Trekking \n \n\nProponents\n Northern Dynasty Minerals\n The Pebble Partnership\n Northern Dynasty (NAK) Institutional Investors\n\nPebble education and information \n PebbleWatch - a Project of Bristol Bay Native Corporation's Land Department\n Pebble Science - Objective Scientific Information on the Proposed Pebble Mine\n Great Deposits \u2013 Alaska\u2019s Pebble Copper-Gold Deposit, Geology and history, updated  October 17, 2019\n\nNews\n\"Alaska Gold\" video documentary July 2012 from PBS Frontline \n \n \n \n UPI: (April 6, 2008) \"Alaska's Pebble Mine worries biologist\"\n Seattle Times: (Feb. 12, 2008) \"Jewelers oppose Alaska mine\"\n Peninsula Clarion: (Feb. 13, 2008) \"Major jewelers oppose Pebble\"\n \n Anchorage Daily News: (March 18, 2009)\"Spending on Pebble prospect falls this year\"\n National Jeweler: (April 7, 2009)\"Alaska gold mine fight heads to London\"\n National Jeweler: (April 14, 2009) \"UK jewelers join boycott of proposed Alaska mine\"\n Homer News: (April 15, 2009) \"Leading UK jewelers say 'no' to Pebble\"\n Homer Tribune: (April 29, 2009) \"Where's 'fault' in Pebble prospect?\"\n \n Anchorage Daily News: (July 29, 2009) Coalition sues to block Pebble mine permits\"\n\nGold mines in the United States\nCopper mines in the United States\nBuildings and structures in Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska\nMines in Alaska", "machine_text": " Pebble Mine is a proposal for a large-scale mining project in the Bristol Bay watershed of southwestern Alaska. The project generally consists of the construction of an open-pit copper and gold mine coupled with an on-site processing plant, port, and associated infrastructure. The project is estimated to contain 80.6 billion pounds of copper, 107.4 million ounces of gold, and 5.6 billion pounds of molybdenum in its deposit. The proposed Pebble Mine has been the subject of heated debate since the idea was first introduced in the late 1990s. Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the project would provide economic and social benefits for Alaska and its residents, including thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues. Opponents of Pebble Mine have argued that the risks the project poses to the fragile ecosystem of the Bristol Bay region, and consequent impacts on wildlife and local indigenous populations, outweigh any potential benefits it may provide. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has launched an effort to restrict the Pebble Mine project under the Clean Water Act. The agency has proposed to institute a policies that would prevent the construction of any large-scale mines like Pebble Mine in the Bristol Bay watershed. If the policies are put in place, the Pebble Mine project would have to find an alternative location, or it would be faced with the choice of finding alternative sources of capital, or abandoning the project altogether. The Pebble Limited Partnership, which is the prime developer of the mine, has criticized the EPA\u2019s decision, arguing that it sets a precedent that invites government intervention and could cost the economy millions of jobs. Meanwhile, a number of local indigenous communities, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders have argued that the EPA\u2019s actions are necessary to protect the Bristol Bay region\u2019s ecosystem and its resources upon which local populations and businesses depend. The outcome of the Pebble Mine debate is yet to be seen. In the meantime, both sides continue to make their case to decision makers and the public in their efforts to influence the final outcome. Despite numerous attempts to move the project forward, experts suggest that the political and regulatory environment in the US and Alaska is currently too uncertain to allow the Pebble Mine project to move forward in its current location.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8796651}

It was discovered on 4 June 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7\u20135.6\u00a0AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8.

It was discovered on September 22, 1984, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The centaur is named after the Greek hero Teucer, son of King Telamon of Salamis and father of bird-ruler King Alastor of Cyprus. At around 30 kilometers in diameter, 2797 Teucer is a relatively large asteroid and is believed to have been dynamically active in the past. It is thought to have been influenced by gravitational perturbations, most likely due to close encounters with the planets Jupiter and Neptune, which explains its highly elongated orbit. The body has a dynamical orbital period of 8.9 years and orbits the Sun at an average distance of 10.3 AU, having a perihelion of 8.45 AU and an aphelion just beyond 12.9 AU. The eccentricity of its orbit is 0.39 and its perihelion location is 7.4\u00b0 below the ecliptic plane. Observations of 2797 Teucer have revealed a rotation period of about 10 hours. Its reflectivity and color shows that the chemistry of its surface is probably similar to that of other primitive asteroids such as D-type asteroids, suggesting the presence of plausible organic and silicate materials. In 2020, Teucer was observed by the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) team, one of the first surveys of trans-Neptunian objects, in order to increase the understanding of the evolution of outer solar system objects. The OSSOS research showed that this centaur was most likely captured from the Jupiter-family comet population. Furthermore, its light-curve amplitude indicated that it is likely to be a triaxial object, making it of general interest for dynamical and physical studies of outer Solar System bodies. In 2021, a paper published by The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada reported on the spectroscopic reflectance variability and spectral similarities between Teucer and other centaur objects. 2797 Teucer is an interesting object due to its peculiar orbit and size. It is representative of the primordial solar system and reveals important information about the evolution of planetary bodies in the outer Solar System.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14941142}

He traced his ancestry back directly to Erdeni Batur (died 1635), the founder of the Dzungar Khanate. His grandfather was Tsering Dondup. His brother, Tsewang Rabtan (1643-1727), led the Dzungar invasion and occupation of Tibet in 1717. His father was the second cousin of Galdan Tseren, the Khong Tayiji of the Dzungar Khanate from 1727 to 1745.\n\nBackground\nDawachi, whose pasture lands were centered in the Tarbagatai region first came to prominence when he and his Khoit-Oirat ally Amursana opposed the rule of Lama Dorji (1728-1753), who had seized the Dzungar throne after assassinating his brother Tsewang Dorji Namjal in 1750. The reign of Lama Dorji's father, Galdan Tseren, represented a resurgence of the Dzungar Khanate's political, military and economic influence in central Asia after the defeats of Galdan Boshugtu Khan's forces by the Qing army fifty years earlier. However, when Galdan Tseren died in 1745, his three sons battled over succession. The political anarchy that ensued all but eliminated the gains made under Galdan Tseren. In 1751, Lama Dorji's pre-emptive military strike defeated forces loyal to Dawachi, who was forced to flee across the border into Kazakh Khanate territory. With a thousand of his men, he and Amursana marched to Ili where they surprised Lama Dorji and killed him on 13 January 1753. Other sources claim that Lama Dorji was killed by his own troops in December 1752.\n\nDawachi seizes power \nFollowing the death of Lama Dorji, Dawachi claimed the title taisha of the Dzungars based on his aristocratic lineage. Amursana, although a prince, was of considerably simpler descent and was of Khoit rather than Dzungar origin. Nevertheless, Amursana, who had married the daughter of Ablai Khan, leader of the neighboring Kazakh Khanate, and had negotiated the support of various Oirat clan leaders, called on Dawachi to divide the Khanate's lands between them as Amursana said he was promised. Dawachi refused and instead attacked Amursana in 1754, forcing him to flee east to Khovd where he swore allegiance to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Empire. The Qianlong Emperor agreed to support Amursana's plans to defeat Dawachi, which included the retaking of Ili and neighboring Kashgar. Meanwhile, most of the Oirat Khoshut had followed Amursana and had defected to the Qing, leaving Dawachi with only the Dzungars under his control.\n\nThe Ili Campaign\n\nLate 1754 and early 1755, in an attempt to definitively settle the 60-year-old Dzungaria problem, the Qianlong Emperor gave orders for a final advance on Ili. Approximately 200,000 soldiers were mobilized for a campaign against Dawachi. Many were Khalkha Mongols, who contributed tens of thousands of horses and mules to the effort. Amursana was made Border Pacification Vice-general of the Left of the Northern Route Army. General Ban Di took supreme command of the army, which set out from Uliastai in March 1755 and linked up with the Western Route Army under Yong Chang and Salar (\u85a9\u5587\u52d2) three months later. The combined forces reached Bortala in June 1755. Militarily, the campaign was much more successful than expected. There were mass desertions among Dawachi's forces when they learned that Amursana was part of the approaching army. In desperation, Dawachi sent a delegation to Beijing led by his son, who expressed his father's desire to become a vassal of the Qing Empire. The Qing army did not respond and continued the campaign.\n\nAfter several skirmishes and small scale battles along the Ili River, the Qing army led by Zhaohui approached Ili and forced Dawachi to withdraw south west to the Gedeng Mountains where he made a last stand with his remaining 10,000 men. Dawachi's army was routed and Dawachi himself was captured by Hakim Beg Hojis who sent him on to Beijing. There, the Qianlong Emperor showed leniency, granting Dawachi a princely title and permitting him to marry a princess from the Qing imperial family. The last years of Dawachi's life were spent in Kalgan where, in 1759, he died from excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nReferences\n\n1759 deaths\nYear of birth unknown\n18th-century Mongol rulers\nDzungar Khanate\nMongol khans\nOirats", "machine_text": " Dawachi is a Korean battle-card game that originated in South Korea.

He was educated in Spain and in the Jesuit school in Nola, Italy, where he lived with his uncle, Philip Cardinal Spinola, Bishop of Nola. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in December 1584, and studied in Naples, Milan, and Rome. He was ordained a priest in 1594, and assigned to serve parishes in Cremona.\n\nTravels\nIn 1595, he received a letter appointing him to the missions in Japan. His journey was marked by shipwrecks and delays, which included his being detained in England.  He first left Italy on his way to Japan in December 1595 but reached his destination only in 1602, over six years later. The first ship he took from Genoa struck a rock and was forced to return to Genoa for repairs. Setting out again, he arrived in Barcelona and made his way on foot to Lisbon.\n\nSpinola, with 7 other Jesuits, set sail from Lisbon on 10 April 1596 with the Portuguese India fleet, bound for Goa. A violent storm damaged the ship's rudder and they were forced to make for Brazil, where they landed on 15 July. They stayed for five months while their ship was repaired, leaving on 12 December 1596, to return to Lisbon.  A severe storm damaged their ship again and they made for Puerto Rico, where they disembarked on 25 March 1597. The missionaries found the general state of morality among the Spanish sugar plantations deplorable, and Spinola considered their arrival providential. Based in San Juan, he and the small band of Jesuits preached and taught catechism, visiting outlying settlements. On one occasion, Spinola was nearly drowned when his horse lost its footing crossing a river.\n\nIn order to return to Lisbon, the group of Jesuits decided to split up among a number of Portuguese ships which set sail together from Puerto Rico on 21 August 1597. The fleet was soon dispersed in a storm. Spinola's ship was captured by an English ship off the Azores on 18 October and he, with his companion Jerome de Angelis, arrived in 'Arthmuth'  (Dartmouth), England, on 5 November.  The next day, his ship continued to its home port 'Atapson' (Topsham), six leagues from 'Arthmuth', where Spinola and de Angelis spent a month being looked after at the Captain's expense.  With the captain's help, they left 'Atapson' on 6 December in a small boat bound for France, but in a storm were swept back to the English coast, where they spent a further month in a different port.  At the beginning of January 1598, he and de Angelis found passage to Lisbon on a German merchant ship.\n\nSpinola spent another year in Lisbon awaiting permission to resume his journey to Japan before setting out once again with the India fleet in the spring of 1599.  This time he had an easier journey, reaching Japan in May 1602 via Goa, Malacca and Macao.\n\nMissionary activity in Japan and Martyrdom \nSpinola studied Japanese in Macao before going to Miyako (Kyoto) where he was minister at the Jesuit College, and a teacher of mathematics and astronomy. For twelve years, he worked at ministering to the growing Christian community in Japan. In 1614, all foreign missionaries were banished so Spinola went into hiding, eluding capture for four years. After being arrested in 1618, he, together with Ambrose Fernandes and their catechist, John Chogoku, were imprisoned for four years in a birdcage-like confinement under harsh conditions. He was burnt at the stake at Nagasaki on 10 September 1622. Spinola was declared Blessed in 1867, along with 30 other Jesuits, over half of whom were Japanese.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFather Hubert Cieslik, S.J., \"Early Jesuit Missionaries in Japan\", pweb.cc.sophia.ac; accessed 1 March 2014.\n\"Jesuit Portraits\", Chapter 9, Fairfield University website; accessed 1 March 2014\n Profile of Blessed Charles Spinola; accessed 1 March 2014.\n\n1564 births\n1622 deaths\n16th-century Genoese people\n17th-century Genoese people\n16th-century Italian Jesuits\n17th-century Italian Jesuits\n17th-century executions by Japan\n17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs\n17th-century venerated Christians\nPeople from Madrid\nMartyred Roman Catholic priests\nRoman Catholic missionaries in Japan\nSpanish people executed abroad\nSpanish people of Italian descent\nCharles\nItalian beatified people\nItalian people executed abroad\nPeople executed by Japan by burning\nItalian Roman Catholic missionaries\nJesuit missionaries in Japan\nSpanish expatriates in Japan\nPeople of Ligurian descent\nPrisoners and detainees of England and Wales", "machine_text": " Charles Spinola was an American businessman who was active on Wall Street for more than 50 years.

He made his debut in 1891 in a minor role in Denmark's Royal Theatre during the birthday celebration of King Christian IX. He soon rose to become one of the most important figures at the theatre, often appearing in leading roles. He achieved fame performing roles in the works of August Bournonville, the great Danish choreographer. In 1898, Henri was invited by Danish-born ballet director and teacher, \u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, to become head of dance at his new ballet school of the same name in Geneva. During his time as director, Nathansen created several ballets, most notably La rose et le Rameau (1901) and Carmen (1910). In 1918, he moved from Geneva to Paris, where he was hired as a ballet master at the Paris Opera. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he created several ballets for the Paris Opera, including Dream of a Summer Night (1921), The Blue Bird (1923). Henri also choreographed ballets for both the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Royal Danish Theatre. Henri was equally committed not only to the Paris Ballet, but also to the advancement of ballet in Scandinavia.

This came at a time when the government were negotiating peace terms to end the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession, which were unlikely to pass the Lords where opposition Whigs and some Tories had joined together to block them under the slogan \"No Peace Without Spain\".\n\nCreation\nTwo of the men, Lord Bruce and Lord Compton, were heirs to existing earldoms and were advanced to the house in their own right using their father's baronies. Others included Harley's son-in-law George Hay as well as George Granville, Thomas Mansel, Thomas Trevor, Thomas Foley all of whom were close political allies of the First Minister. Most controversial was that of Samuel Masham, the husband of Queen Anne's favourite Abigail Hill, a cousin and ally of Harley. While Bruce's letters patent were dated 31 December 1711, the other creations all took place on the subsequent day 1 January 1712. When Parliament resumed on 2 January they took their seats. Because their numbers resembled that of a jury, the Whig Lord Wharton mockingly asked if they were going to speak individually or elect a foreman to do so.\n\nAftermath\nDespite the controversy Harley was able to subsequently pass the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. However, the narrow Tory majority in the Lords disappeared in 1714 following the Hanoverian Succession when the Tory government was replaced by George I. Harley's alleged abuse of royal power and the violation of the constitution were part of the articles of impeachment against him, when he was prosecuted by Parliament in 1715. \n\nIn 1719 partly in a response to Harley's earlier creations, the Whig government of James Stanhope proposed a Peerage Bill which would have largely limited further expansion of the House of Lords.

Located in the Sierra Nevada of California, it is a major attraction in the park, especially in late spring when the water flow is at its peak.\n\nSections\nThe falls consist of three sections:\n\n Upper Yosemite Fall: The  plunge comprises over half the total drop. Trails from the valley floor and down from other park areas outside the valley lead to both the top and base of Upper Yosemite Fall.  The upper fall is formed by the swift waters of Yosemite Creek, which, after meandering through Eagle Creek Meadow, drop over the edge of a hanging valley in a spectacular and deafening show of force.\n\n Middle Cascades: Between the two obvious main plunges there are a series of four smaller plunges collectively referred to as the Middle Cascades. Taken together these account for a total drop of , more than twice the height of the Lower Fall. Because of the narrow, constricted shape of the gorge in which these drops occur and the lack of public access, they are rarely noted. Most viewpoints in the valley miss them entirely. Several vantage points for the cascades are found along the Yosemite Falls trail. Several hikers climbing down from the trail towards the cascades have required an expensive helicopter rescue due to steep and slippery terrain and features.\n\n Lower Yosemite Fall: The final  drop adjacent to an accessible viewing area, provides the most-used viewing point for the waterfalls. Yosemite Creek emerges from the base of the Lower Fall and flows into the Merced River nearby. Like many areas of Yosemite the plunge pool at the base of the Lower Fall is surrounded by dangerous jumbles of talus made even more treacherous by the high humidity and resulting slippery surfaces.\n\nIn all but the wettest years, the falls cease flowing altogether in late summer or fall.  A very small number of rock climbers have taken the opportunity to climb the normally inaccessible rock face beneath the falls, although this is an extraordinarily dangerous undertaking; a single afternoon thunderstorm could restart the falls, sweeping the climbers off the face.\n\nLower Yosemite Fall is easily accessible near the Yosemite Lodge in Yosemite Valley. The top of Upper Yosemite Fall may be reached via a steep, strenuous, and usually crowded  hike beginning near Camp 4 in Yosemite valley. Upper Yosemite Fall may also be reached via the Yosemite Creek Trail from the Tioga Road to the north.\n\nThe Ahwahneechee Legend\nThe main village of the native people of Yosemite Valley, the Ahwahneechee, was located at the base of the falls.\n\nThe Ahwahneechee people called the waterfall \"Cholock\" (\"the fall\") and believed that the plunge pool at its base was inhabited by the spirits of several witches, called the Poloti. An Ahwaneechee folktale describes a woman going to fetch a pail of water from the pool, and drawing it out full of snakes. Later that night, after the woman had trespassed into their territory, the spirits caused the woman's house to be sucked into the pool by a powerful wind, taking the woman and her newborn baby with it.\n\nSee also\nList of waterfalls by height\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \nWorld of Waterfalls.com: Yosemite Falls \n\nWaterfalls of Yosemite National Park\nTiered waterfalls\nWaterfalls of Mariposa County, California\nTourist attractions in Mariposa County, California", "machine_text": " Yosemite Falls is the largest waterfall in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, located in California, United States. It is made up of three separate falls: Upper Yosemite Fall, the middle cascades, and Lower Yosemite Fall. The upper fall has a total height of 2,425 feet (739 m), making it the 6th highest waterfall in the world. The Falls were formed when glaciers carved the Yosemite Valley many thousands of years ago. It is one of the most iconic and dramatic waterfalls in the United States, and is featured prominently on maps of the park. It can be seen easily from many points within the park, and is a popular destination for tourists and photographers. The most popular time of year to visit Yosemite Falls is from April to June. During these months, the waterfall is at its peak, with the peak flow of water occurring in May. However, the waterfall can be beautiful and powerful at any point in the year, and the best way to adequately appreciate it is to hike the nearby trails. Yosemite Falls Trail is the most popular hike to reach the falls, taking around 2.5 hours to complete and offering spectacular views at various points along the way. The falls are also a popular spot for rock climbers. There are three main climbing routes on the falls: East Buttress, Middle Cascade, and Lower Yosemite Fall. All three routes offer unique challenges and spectacular views of Yosemite Valley. The view of Yosemite Falls is enhanced when the setting sun illuminates the water drops, giving them a rainbow-like effect.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alan E. Cober\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Alan E. Cober (May 18, 1935 \u2013 January 17, 1998), born in New York City was an American illustrator. His artwork appeared in The New York Times, Life,Time and numerous other publications. Cober was inducted into the Illustration Hall of Fame in 2011, thirteen years after his death in 1998. Cober was frequently cited as one of the most innovative illustrators America has ever produced.\n\nEarly life and education\nCober was born in New York City, grew up in the Bronx and attended public schools. In 1952 he attended a preparatory school in Riverdale, the Barnard School for Boys. His father, Sol Walter Cohen was a criminal lawyer for 48 years until his death in 1974. The young artist was close to his father and through him, gained firsthand knowledge of courtrooms, police work and the detention of criminals. This experience would later inform his own views and subsequent art on perceived social inequities. His mother, Molly, was president of the Sarah Starkman League for Retarded Children. During his teenage years, Cober would accompany her as she cared for many children in her care.\n\nCober would initially attend the University of Vermont, but later graduated in 1966 from the School of Visual Arts in New York City\nwhere the young artist would learn the importance of drawing and seeing. Cober was drafted into the Army in April 1958, going through basic training at Fort Dix, he spent the remaining two years of service teaching officers and heading the graphics department at the Special Warfare School, at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Cober would spend those two years drawing and learning and that is where he felt he received his real education.\n\nCareer\nCober was one of a small group of American illustrators who initially brought aspects of modern art into commercial art. His magazine illustrations rejected the existing top-down approach of art direction and embraced a far more expressive and symbolic approach to the subject matter. He did not mimic a passage of text, as was the convention at the time in illustration, but instead embraced artistic interpretation. He was one of a few illustrators during the 1960s to make gritty graphic commentary flourish in the rigid world of American illustration. The credit for works such as Cober's being published goes to art directors who were to bring innovative illustrations to print, notably among them Cipe Pineles at Seventeen, Richard Gangel at Sports Illustrated, and Henry Wolf at Esquire.\n\nCober would be commissioned for work by publications such as LIFE, LOOK, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Newsweek, Science Digest, The Atlantic, The New York Times and covers for Time magazine. His corporate clients included Exxon, CBS, American Airlines, IBM, General Electric, IT and Texaco.\n\nIn addition to illustration, his mediums included painting, printmaking and clay and ceramic sculpture.\n\nVisual journalism\nEarly in his career, Cober traveled the United States working on a commission received from the National Park Service. His drawings were made on site at Mount Rushmore, Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello, the Battle of Gettysburg and Colonial Williamsburg. Cober documented the locations by drawing in his sketchbook. As he would often do throughout his career, each drawing would document his journalistic views and personal feelings that he was experiencing at the given moment.\n\nOn assignment with The New York Times, Cober was provided access to the Willowbrook mental health facility in Staten Island. The assignment was to create two drawings for publication. Cober created fifty, many of which would end up being published in his 1975 book,The Forgotten Society which documented his reaction to conditions for the mentally handicapped, prisoners and the aged in New York state with 92 drawings and was published by Dover Press and featured in People magazine. The book would be reprinted in numerous editions up until 2012 with an introduction by his daughter, Leslie Cober-Gentry.\n\nWhen Cober decided he wanted to do a series of work on circus life, he got in touch with Kenneth Feld, owner of Barnum and Bailey Circus. Agreeable to the idea of Cober drawing the circus, Feld provided him with the credentials necessary to enter backstage. When the circus came to Madison Square Garden,Cober came in to create portraits of the characters and performers he took an interest in. He would become friends with many of the performers as they sat for portraits between their acts. Lou Jacobs was a favorite model of Cober's. Other popular performers who modeled for Cober were Mishu, billed as the \"smallest man on earth\", Philippe Petit, the high-wire artist who would later become famous for his highwire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974, as well as lion trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams. Cober drew their living conditions in their trailers, their families and pets, depicting a culture unknown to the audience who could only appreciate the circus from the bleachers.\n\nIn 1982, the Smithsonian Institution commissioned Cober to create a mural in celebration of George Washington's 250th birthday.\n\nAmong his many other notable journalistic assignments were his coverage of the shuttle liftoffs from Cape Canaveral for NASA, the 1980 presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter for TIME, and in 1987 Cober traveled on the press plane to cover Pope John Paul's visit to the United States for Rolling Stone.\n\nHis fascination with mental as well as physical decay and a compassion for social issues formed the foundation of his artistic themes throughout his career. Cober's aim as a visual journalist (which is what he called himself) was to effect change by graphically exposing what he determined as critically important to interpret at the time.\n\nMuseum exhibitions\nIn 1992, the Georgia Museum of Art displayed Cober's work in an exhibition titled Alan E. Cober: suite Georgia. The exhibition title refers to prints Cober completed during 1991 as the Lamar Dodd Professorial Chair at the University Of Georgia. The exhibition included etchings made of such folk artists as Howard Finster, R.A. Miller, Reverend John D. Ruth as well as Georgia tourist attractions such as the statue of Br'er Rabbit in downtown Eatonton, Georgia.\n\nIn 1992, the Katonah Museum of Art would display a thirty-year retrospective of Cober's visual reportage of news, culture and the environment. The exhibition would travel to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and then to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Alabama. The exhibition was curated by Steven Heller\n\nFour years after his death, an exhibition of his work, titled Alan E. Cober: A Retrospective Afterlife, was organized by the Ringling School of Art and appeared at the University at Buffalo in 2002. The exhibit included over 100 drawings and was on display from February 15 through May 18 of 2002.\n\nBibliography\nCober would illustrate 25 books, two of which made The New York Times Ten Best Illustrated Books: Winter's Eve (1969) and Mr. Corbett's Ghost (1968).

Classes were only held on Thursday and Friday because he flew to Buffalo on Thursday from downstate New York to teach the class, then flew back home on Friday. He also required at least one sketch a day in a personal journal. The assignments were usually 'live', meaning that the whole class' final pieces were submitted to a publication, and they chose one to print. The class took field trips to Toronto to see Henrik Drescher, to Phillip Burke's studio, to the Buffalo Museum to draw, to the Anthropology Lab on Campus to draw (dead creatures, including a dead person). Everything Cober taught centered around drawing. In his life drawing classes he was never interested in having the figure look exactly the way it should in nature. An interesting drawing was more important to him as a teacher.\n\nHe said of his teaching: \"My students call it 'traumatic drawing' because of where I take them to draw.\"\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 2001, family and friends of Cober established the Alan E. Cober Memorial Fund at the University of Buffalo to honor his memory and body of work and to advance graphic illustration.\n\nHe was the youngest artist ever named Artist of the Year by the Artists Guild in New York City, in 1966\n\nIllustration Hall of Fame, Society of Illustrators, 2011\nHamilton King Award, Society of Illustrators, 1969\nTen Gold and two Silver medals, Society of Illustrators\nDistinguished Educator in the Arts Award, Society of Illustrators, 1998\nPresident of the Illustrators Workshop (1974-1993)\n\nReferences\n\n1935 births\n1998 deaths\nArtists from New York City\nAmerican magazine illustrators\nSchool of Visual Arts alumni", "machine_text": " Alan E. Cober (born 1941) is an American painter who works primarily in oils, watercolors and ink, known for his work with Native American subject matter and compositions. Cober was born in St. Louis, Missouri and attended the University of Oklahoma and the Art Students League from 1971 to 1974. Cober's early work focused on his experience in the army and traveling for the United States Service. His work from this period incorporated abstracted or \"abstract-surrealism\u201d compositions. His military experience created an opportunity for him to travel and documented his observations in India and Japan by giving water colors to friends and family. In the mid-1970\u2019s his work shifted to the representation of Native American imagery. Drawing inspiration from vintage photographs of Native Americans which he collected. As his work evolved Cober created his own documents by collecting oral histories, conducting primary research and collaborating with prominent Native American artists. His work also takes on an autobiographical aspect as he commemorates his own social and cultural identity: he identifies as a Jewish American. In the early 1980\u2019s Cober moved to the East Coast and had regular exhibitions at M. Knoedler and Co. in New York in 1982 and 1983. Cober is the recipient of awards from the National Academy of Design in 1973, The National Endowment of the Arts in 1981 and The Missouri Arts Council in 1983. He was honored with a retrospective at the University of Missouri-Kansas City\u2019s Museum of Art in 1990 and again in 2007 at the NJ State Museum\u2019s photography gallery. He has been invited to exhibit in many invitational shows and galleries, including exhibitions at the Heard Museum, The Tucson Museum of Art, The Cedar Rapids Museum of Art, The Eiteljorg Museum and The Gilcrease Museum. Cober was involved with the Brooklyn Artists Gym, which offers a space for young and emerging artist to develop their skills. He was actively involved in non-profit organizations and taught extensively during the course of his career, most recently at the University of Missouri-Kansas City where he was designated a Visiting Professional Artist from 2008 to 2012. Cober's works are in many permanent public and private collections, including those of the National Museum of the American Indian and The National Portrait Gallery. Cober presently lives in Brooklyn, New York. Cober's work is known for its vibrant colors and composition. He uses a combination of realism and abstract expressionism, layering paint to create a sense of depth, texture and emotion in his work. In addition, his work often ties together his Jewish ethnic identity and focuses on themes of environmental and spiritual awareness. His work celebrates both the beauty of Native American culture and his relationship to it.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1841327}

In later life he was considered an eccentric.\n\nEarly life\nLord Rokeby was born Matthew Robinson in a large family from Yorkshire. His parents were Matthew Robinson (1694\u20131778) of Edgely and West Layton, Yorkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Drake of Cambridge; his sisters included the novelists Elizabeth Montagu and Sarah Scott. Of his six brothers, Thomas the second was known as a legal writer, William the fifth as a cleric, and the youngest, Charles, as a Member of Parliament. His father inherited property in the neighbourhood of Rokeby from his great-uncle Matthew Robinson, rector of Burneston; and his mother inherited the Mount Morris estate at Monks Horton, near Hythe, Kent, from her brother Morris Drake Morris, which Rokeby in turn succeeded to in 1746.\n\nRobinson was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1730, and to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1731. He became a Fellow there in 1734. In 1746 his mother died and he inherited her Monks Horton property. As a consequence, he then assumed the additional name of Morris.\n\nIn November 1746 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society citation reads: Mathew Robinson Esqr, A Gentleman well versed in Philosophical Learning, and polite Literature; being desirous of becoming a fellow of this Society, We on our personal knowledge do recommend him as every way qualified and likely to become a usefull Member of our Body. His proposers were Edw Montagu (brother-in-law); Daniel Wray; Geo Lewis Scott (brother-in-law); Henry Baker; Robt Smith; M Folkes.\n\nHe was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the Bedford Level Corporation in 1756, a position he held until 1763.\n\nRobinson-Morris represented Canterbury in Parliament, from 1747 to 1761; in politics he was a Whig. He inherited the title Lord Rokeby in 1794 after the death of his father's second  cousin, The 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh.\n\nSupposed eccentric\n\nThe 2nd Lord Rokeby became an enthusiastic supporter of baths during a holiday in the spa town of Aix-la-Chapelle. When he returned to Kent, he began to make daily trips to the seashore to swim in salt water regardless of the weather. He preferred this environment to such an extent that his servant had to persuade him to come home. Sometimes he fainted and had to be rescued. He had a hut built for him on the sands at Hythe and drinking fountains along his route to the beach. He walked all the way and let his servant follow him in the carriage with full livery. If he found people drinking from a fountain, he gave them a half-crown coin.\n\nHe also let his beard grow, which was against the contemporary fashion. Eventually it was so thick that it stuck out under his arms and could be seen from behind.  In a couple of years he decided to build a swimming pool in his mansion - it was built under glass and was heated by sun. There he spent hours at the time, preferably alone. He refused to have a fire in his house even in the coldest weather.\n\nHis increased isolation bred rumours, including one that he was a cannibal or ate only raw meat - when he ate mainly beef tea and nibbled at venison. He also refused to see any doctors. As for church service, he claimed that God was best worshipped at natural altars of the earth, the sea and the sky - not to mention that the sermons were boring.\n\nWhen Lord Rokeby did indeed agree to accept visitors, he might \"entertain\" them with lengthy, boring poems. He arranged a sumptuous meal for Prince William of Gloucester but ate very little himself. He very rarely visited the court and then was an embarrassment to his socialite sister, Elizabeth Montagu. When he stayed at the Chequers Inn at Lenham in 1796 so he could vote in the general election, curious locals took him for a Turk.\n\nIn January 1755 Mrs. Montagu wrote to their sister, Sarah Scott:\n'Brother Robinson is emulating the great Diogenes and other ... doctors of the stoic fur; he flies the life of London and leads a life of such privacy and seriousness as looks to the beholder like wisdom', and in 1756 she reported that he now lived upon almost raw meat, never touched bread, considering corn exotic, and for the same reason substituted honey for sugar.\n\nDeath\nLord Rokeby died in December 1800, peacefully in his bed.  His title and estates passed to his nephew Morris Robinson, 3rd Baron Rokeby. His tomb in Armagh Cathedral is sculpted by John Bacon.\n\nReferences\n\nEdith Sitwell, English Eccentrics: A gallery of weird and wonderful men and women, Harmondsworth: Penguin (1983), pp.\u00a047\u201355.\n\nAttribution\n\n.\n\n1712 births\n1800 deaths\nBarons in the Peerage of Ireland\nFellows of Trinity Hall, Cambridge\nMembers of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies\nBritish MPs 1747\u20131754\nBritish MPs 1754\u20131761\nFellows of the Royal Society", "machine_text": " Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby (17 June 1712 \u2013 5 October 1774) was a British peer and politician who served as an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy from 1748 to 1768. He was born in Grinnell Park, near Lyndhurst, Hampshire, the son of Matthew Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby, and Sarah, the daughter of William Jenney.

It creates a major refugium to arcto-alpine and alpine biota in a region with warm winters. As the 60 m deep sinkhole is prone to cold-air pooling, frequent freeze-thaw cycles create favourable conditions for periglacially formed features (i.e. solifluction, periglacially patterned ground).\nThe sinkhole is at 1584 m elevation and consists of 4 interconnected sinks. The major sink is laterally elongated, 440 m long. The outflow of the cold air is at 1647 m and the depth of the basin atmosphere is 63 m.\n\nIn 2020, a relict population of the Alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) was reported from the sink, which fills a 200 km wide distribution gap in the species range.\n\nTopography and Geology \nThe Opuvani do is on Mt Orjen on the Bijela gora, which is part of the High Karst nappe. It is formed of Triassic-Paleogene shallow water calcareous sediments, which were interrupted by a short episode of Middle Triassic deepening and rifting-related volcanism, which is characteristic for the larger Adriatic carbonate platform. It is estimated that the High karst nappe has a recent thrusting of at least 30 km. The Opuvani do is interditated with wide slopes. At its southern part, a fluvioglacial short trench of a paleo-valley (dry valley) leads upslope to the alpine valley that intersects the Jastrebica ridge. The eastern side of the shallow fluvioglacial channel is showing terraces of putative glaviofluvial origin.\n\nThe Opuvani do was formed between the axis of the overturned syncline of the Jastrebica ridge and the axis of an oblique anticline in the Opaljika escarpment. Upslope bedrock lithologies of the Jastrebica are composed by upper Cretaceous series of bedded Turonian limestones. Bedded Cenomanian dolomitic limestones appear further downslope. The Opuvani do is embedded in lithologies at the Cenomanian/Turonian border of the High-Karst nappe. It formed in vertical shortened, steep layered, bedded Cenomanian dolomitic limestones. Geological configuration for the paleodoline development is constricted in the folding of the Opaljika (1668 m a.s.l) anticline with bedrocks of lower Cretaceous and upper Jurassic dolomites.\n\nRefugial vegetation \nIt was previously assumed that glacial relict/refugial flora are absent in the maritime High-Karst physiographic area with warm winters from the Mount Orjen Range in Montenegro.  After a recent detection of residual arcto-alpine and boreo-alpine biocoenoses (Salicion retusae, Scabioso silenifoliae-Dryadetum octopetalae, Drepanoclado uncinati-Heliospermetum pusillum and Allietum schoenoprasi), 70 km south of known Dinaric inland localities, this assumption was called into question. The reason for the survival of cold loving species in a climate with warm winters is attributed to frequent cold-air pooling, which creates local areas with continental climates.\n\nClimate \n\nThe closest weather station which provides official weather service data is located at Crkvice. As it lies at an elevation of 940 m temperature measurements are not representative to the local microclimate of the sinkhole.\n\nIn order to get more precise data for the local basin atmosphere, temperature data loggers had been installed through a funded project at the Department of Geography at the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich since August 2020.\n\nReferences \n\nOrjen\nDinaric Alps\nMountains of Montenegro\nNik\u0161i\u0107 Municipality", "machine_text": ". Opuvani do is a traditional ritual performed by the Kara tribe of Belize. It is held annually at the end of the rainy season, sometime between June and August, to celebrate the harvest and to bring good luck for the coming year. The tradition has been passed down for many generations, and is still observed today by many of the tribal members. The ritual occurs over the course of three days. The first day is dedicated to preparing the food and gathering the offerings that will be presented to the gods. This includes items such as corn, wood, tobacco, and traditional tribal clothing. On the second day, a large bonfire is lit in the center of the village and offerings of food and flowers are placed on top of it. During the night, the participants encircle the fire while singing songs of thanks to the gods. On the third day, the participants make their way to a nearby river or lake. They construct a temporary altar on the shore and make further offerings. During this time, some of the participants will jump into the water in a demonstration of the strength and power of the gods. Afterward, all of the offerings are gathered together in the middle of the altar and the gods are asked to bring good luck and blessings upon the village. Following the completion of Opuvani do, the villagers return home and celebrations continue with a large feast and traditional music. At the end of the feast, the elders of the village address the group, thanking the gods for their blessings and asking for guidance and protection for the future. Opuvani do is a cultural tradition that is deeply rooted in the history and beliefs of the Kara tribe. It is celebrated to this day as a reminder of their ancestral heritage and as a chance to reap the benefits of a successful harvest.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 68558755}

He began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1908 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1916. He went to Paris in 1919, where he became acquainted with the nurse Signe Dahl and they later married in 1920.  In addition to his work and social commitment, in the early 1920s H\u00f6jer researched vitamin C and its role in connective tissue cell maturation. He submitted his thesis in Stockholm in 1924 for PhD degree as Studies in scurvy, and then became the Associate Professor of Hygiene in the Physiological Institute at Lund University.\n\nIn 1930, he was appointed as the city physician () of Malm\u00f6 and subsequently, in 1935, became Director General of the National Swedish Board of Health, a post he left in 1952. During his time on the Medical Board, he made several reforms in terms of preventive care, including family planning, maternal assistance and care of infants as well as dental services. Additionally during that time, the Vipeholm experiments on dental caries were conducted.\n\nH\u00f6jer was appointed to the UN's expert commission for economic affairs and its housing commission. He was sent as a special officer for improving medical education in India at the request of Travancore-Cochin state (present-day Kerala state). H\u00f6jer was appointed as the Principal of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, a position he held until 1954.\n\nAfter retirement, he worked on international issues, including the effects of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe H\u00f6jer Investigation \nH\u00f6jer led the Board of Health study in 1948 on health care reorganization. The study suggested a focus on preventive care and strengthening of provincial medical offices. The proposal was motivated in particular by the fact that the proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. In the study, the Medical Board argued against the Medical Association's view with regard to primary care. The report advocated a polyclinic model, where outpatient health care would be free and community-run.\n\nThe H\u00f6jer study was the first more comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested the establishment of health centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and would be located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and be located in the provincial doctors' stations. H\u00f6jer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.\n\nControversies \nH\u00f6jer's combination of pacifism, socialism, anti-clericalism, anti-Nazism and temperance led to political persecution in Sydsvenska Dagbladet and Aftonbladet, Swedish newspapers. He was dismissed from a job as a teacher in the Southern Sweden Nursing School on the grounds that he held a lecture on sexual health. As city physician () in Malm\u00f6, he tried to address air pollution from the Scanian Cement factory at Limhamn in Malm\u00f6. The company director threatened Malm\u00f6 municipality, stating the company would move to another location if they followed the doctor's recommendations.\n\nConcerning Jewish refugees, H\u00f6jer met stiff resistance from the management of the Swedish medical establishment. When a Jewish ophthalmologist had to leave his home after the German occupation of Danzig and tried to find work in Sweden, the medical professionals in the country sued to stop it, citing various reasons. A campaign with a hint of anti-Semitism was taken up by the medical establishments. When the Medical Board in 1939 planned to invite 12 Jewish specialty physicians to Sweden, the doctors' associations protested, suggesting it would lead to unemployment. , a protest arranged by the student body at Uppsala University, also spoke out against accepting Jewish refugees. The royal family intervened, and H\u00f6jer was called to the ruler, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, with the proposal that Sweden should accept only a small number of Jewish doctors who were fleeing Hitler's persecution. \"He asked me pleadingly to refrain from proposals and actions, which could put the unity of the Swedish people in danger. I answered respectfully but firmly \u2013 with the Court Marshal listening in the background \u2013 that I obviously did not want to increase the government's difficulties, but I found that the request is primarily aimed to appease the anti-Semitic circles. It would be ignominious if Sweden were to betray people in danger. The Crown Prince reiterated his warning. I declared I would keep it in mind the future, and would do it if my conscience allows. We parted without further discussion\". H\u00f6jer also asked to increase the number of doctors in the country, by importing Austrian physicians in 1950, which again was opposed by the Medical Association.\n\nBibliography \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  (autobiography)\n\nReferences\n\n1890 births\n1974 deaths\n20th-century Swedish physicians\nSwedish healthcare managers\nPeople from Gotland\nKarolinska Institute alumni", "machine_text": " Axel H\u00f6jer (1885-1959) was a Swedish mathematician and professor of mathematics at Uppsala University.

In 1918 H\u00f6jer became a professor of mathematics at Uppsala University, a position he held until his death. H\u00f6jer's primary research interest was algebraic number theory, which he made several important contributions to, including the proof of the important lemma of Kronecker-Weber in 1918. This lemma essentially states that every abelian number field, or a field generated by roots of a polynomial, is contained inside a cyclotomic field, which is a field generated by roots of unity. H\u00f6jer also made major contributions to the study of class field theory, which includes class groups, ideal classes, and cyclic algebras.

It lived during the Jurassic period in what is now Europe, from 195-177 million years ago. Microcleidus was a medium-sized animal, measuring up to 4 metres long. It had a long, slender body, with four flippers and a long tail. Its skull was quite wide and flat, with large eyes positioned near the front of its head. Its teeth were small and splay-shaped. Microcleidus probably fed mostly on small fish and squid. Its small teeth indicate that it may have chased down prey rather than waiting for it to come to it. It probably found its food while swimming around in the shallow seas that used to cover much of Europe. Microcleidus is thought to be closely related to the ancient aquatic reptiles known as thalattosaurs. Both genera had similar long bodies and large eyes, which suggest a similar lifestyle. Like thalattosaurs, it\u2019s likely that Microcleidus spent much of its time in the shallow seas of the Late Jurassic. Microcleidus remains are quite rare, but the few remains found indicate that it was quite widespread in the late Jurassic seas of Europe. It is known from bone fragments and teeth found in sites in Bavaria, Germany, and in Aquitaine, France. Microcleidus is an important link in the development of today\u2019s marine reptiles. Its four-flippered body plan and large eyes provide evidence of the transition from ancient amphibious reptiles to the fully aquatic reptiles of today. Microcleidus was first described by the French palaeontologist \u00c9douard Lambert in 1874. It was named after the Greek words for \u201clittle key\u201d, in reference to the small size of its teeth. However, Lambert was not able to determine the exact species ofMicrocleidus. The exact species has since been established and is currently known as Microcleidus deloisei.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5857962}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oxalis triangularis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Oxalis triangularis, commonly called false shamrock, is a species of perennial plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to several countries in southern South America. This woodsorrel is typically grown as a houseplant but can be grown outside in USDA climate zones 8a\u201311, preferably in light shade.\n\nThe deep maroon leaves are trifoliate, like species in the clover genus Trifolium which are commonly called shamrock, hence the name \u201cfalse shamrock\u201d. An interesting feature is that the leaves close like an umbrella at night (See the timelapse video below) or when disturbed or if kept under harsh sunlight. The white or pale pink five-petalled flowers also close at night.\n\nDescription\nGrowing to  tall and broad, the subspecies O. triangularis subsp. papilionacea, the purpleleaf false shamrock, is hardy in mild and coastal areas of Britain, down to , and has won the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. It is a perennial plant without aerial stem, formed by leaves borne by a long petiole emerging at the ground level of a tuberous rhizome (5 cm long, over 10 - 15  mm in diameter, fully covered with scales). The leaf is formed of three sessile leaflets, obtriangular to obovate-triangular, glabrous, arranged in the same plane perpendicular to the petiole.\n\nThe five densely haired sepals are 5 to 5.5 mm long, narrow and slightly reddish at the top. The five white petals are about 2 inches long and oblong-lanceolate. The stamens and the style are densely hairy. The limb of the wild species is green but purple cultivars have been selected for horticulture. The petiole, soft, whitish, is 15 to 25 cm long. Flowering takes place from spring to autumn.\n\nMovement\n\nThe leaves of O. triangularis move in response to light levels, opening in high ambient light (in the day) and closing at low light levels (at night). During this movement, the leaflets fold at the level of the central vein. This movement is not due to growth and is instead powered by changes in turgor pressure in cells at the base of the leaf. It is an example of photonasty.\n\nRange\nThe species is distributed in several countries of South America: Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. It is a neophyte in the United States in the states of Florida and Louisiana. It is also widely found in East India abundantly in states like Nagaland and Manipur.\n\nCultivation and life cycle\n\nO. triangularis requires bright indirect sunlight supplemented with a cool indoor temperature of . It can tolerate higher indoor temperatures but will go into dormancy prematurely and/or begin to take on a \"tired\" appearance if temperatures exceed  for prolonged periods of time. It thrives in an average potting soil with good drainage.\n\nMature plants are cut back to the soil every 3\u20135 years in early summer or during the dormancy period.  Young plants are cut back to the soil every year in early summer or during the dormancy period, until they reach maturity. Fearing frost, they are usually grown indoors. They are planted in soil rich in humus and well drained. They should be watered only when the topsoil looks dry. In winter, they should not be watered.\n\nThe subspecies Oxalis triangularis subsp papilionacea has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nUsage\nThe leaves are eaten raw or cooked and have an acidic taste due to their oxalic acid content. Leaves and flowers can be used as a decoration for salads. When consuming larger amounts of leaves, the oxalic acid can cause discomfort. The rhizomes are eaten raw or cooked and have a sweet taste.\n\nPropagation\nOxalis triangularis grows from corms, propagated by division. Like other corms, it goes through regular dormancy periods; at the end of each period, the corms can be unearthed, offsets cut and replanted in appropriate soil, where they will grow into new plants.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (for conservation status)\nZimmerman, Maureen Williams.

It is native to South and Central America and is often grown as an ornamental garden plant. Oxalis triangularis is an evergreen perennial that usually grows to a height of one to two feet, although some specimens can reach three feet. It has three-part clover-like leaves which are a deep purple color with a silvery white underside and bloom in the summer. The flowers are typically yellow, although some varieties have white or pink flowers. The plant is grown with an easy care, easy to grow style. It requires medium temperatures, indirect sunlight, and moist soil with good drainage. It should be watered regularly and kept in warm temperatures, around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. It is important to note that Oxalis triangularis is considered to be an invasive species and is banned in many countries, most notably the United Kingdom. It has been observed to quickly overrun gardens and other spaces, which potentially threatens the local plant species. Oxalis triangularis is not suitable for consumption, as it is bitter and inedible. Its toxicity can cause severe gastrointestinal distress and headaches if ingested in large amounts. It is poisonous for humans and animals, so it is important to keep this plant away from pets and children. The Purple Shamrock makes an excellent garden specimen and is often used as an ornamental accent indoors. It can also be used in window boxes, on patios, or as border plants in gardens. In optimum conditions, it can spread quickly, so a regular pruning schedule is recommended. Oxalis triangularis has long been a popular ornamental garden plant and has several medicinal properties as well. It has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat digestive complaints, and more recently, it has been studied for its potential to treat diabetes and cancer. Overall, while it is a beautiful and low-maintenance garden specimen, it is important to keep Oxalis triangularis away from children and animals, stay aware of local bans in certain areas, and keep mindful of its potential invasiveness in gardens.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16161772}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Division of Korea\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The division of Korea began with the defeat of Japan in World War II.  During the war, the Allied leaders considered the question of Korea's future after Japan's surrender in the war.  The leaders reached an understanding that Korea would be liberated from Japan but would be placed under an international trusteeship until the Koreans would be deemed ready for self-rule.\n\nIn the last days of the war, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones (a U.S. and Soviet one) with the 38th parallel as the dividing line. The Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.\n\nIt was understood that this division was only a temporary arrangement until the trusteeship could be implemented. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in December 1945 resulted in an agreement on a four-power Korean trusteeship lasting up to five years. However, with the onset of the Cold War and other factors both international and domestic, including Korean opposition to the trusteeship, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union over the next two years regarding the implementation of the trusteeship failed, thus effectively nullifying the only agreed-upon framework for the re-establishment of an independent and unified Korean state.\n\nWith this, the Korean question was referred to the United Nations.  In 1948, after the UN failed to produce an outcome acceptable to the Soviet Union, UN-supervised elections were held in the US-occupied south only. The American-backed Syngman Rhee won the election, while Kim Il-sung consolidated his position as the leader of Soviet-occupied northern Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea on 15 August 1948, promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea on 9 September 1948. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula.\n\nIn 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, North Korea invaded South Korea in an attempt to re-unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and has left Korea divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) up to the present day.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, during the 2018 Inter-Korean Summit, the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted between the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un and the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in. Later that same year, following the September Inter-Korean Summit, several actions were taken toward reunification along the border, such as the dismantling of guard posts and the creation of buffer zones to prevent clashes.  On 12 December 2018, soldiers from both Koreas crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into the opposition countries for the first time in history.\n\nHistorical background\n\nJapanese rule (1910\u20131945)\n\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal protectorate of Japan, and was annexed by Japan in 1910. The Korean Emperor Gojong was removed. In the following decades, nationalist and radical groups emerged to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to come together in one national movement. The Korean Provisional Government in exile in China failed to obtain widespread recognition.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAt the Cairo Conference in November 1943, in the middle of World War Two, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force. At the end of the conference, the three powers declared that they were, \"mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.\" Roosevelt floated the idea of a trusteeship over Korea, but did not obtain agreement from the other powers. Roosevelt raised the idea with Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945. Stalin did not disagree, but advocated that the period of trusteeship be short.\n\nAt the Tehran and Yalta Conferences, Stalin promised to join his allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe. On 8 August 1945, two days after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, but before the second bomb was dropped at Nagasaki, the USSR declared war on Japan. As war began, the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East, Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky, called on Koreans to rise up against Japan, saying \"a banner of liberty and independence is rising in Seoul\".\n\nSoviet troops advanced rapidly, and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On 10 August 1945 two young officers \u2013 Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel \u2013 were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel as the dividing line. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he \"almost surely\" would have chosen a different line. The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone. Rusk observed, \"even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement\u00a0... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops\". He noted that he was \"faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area\". To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division. The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.\n\nSoviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by 14 August and rapidly took over the north-east of the country, and on 16 August they landed at Wonsan. On 24 August, the Red Army reached Pyongyang, the third largest city in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nGeneral Nobuyuki Abe, the last Japanese Governor-General of Korea, had established contact with a number of influential Koreans since the beginning of August 1945 to prepare the hand-over of power. Throughout August, Koreans organized people's committee branches for the \"\" (CPKI), led by Lyuh Woon-hyung, a left-wing politician. On 6 September 1945, a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short-lived People's Republic of Korea. In the spirit of consensus, conservative elder statesman Syngman Rhee, who was living in exile in the US, was nominated as president.\n\nPost\u2013World War II\n\nDivision (since 2 September 1945)\n\nSoviet occupation of northern Korea\n\nWhen Soviet troops entered Pyongyang, they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist Cho Man-sik. The Soviet Army allowed these \"People's Committees\" (which were friendly to the Soviet Union) to function. In September 1945, the Soviet administration issued its own currency, the \"Red Army won\". In 1946, Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov took charge of the administration and began to lobby the Soviet government for funds to support the ailing economy.\n\nIn February 1946 a provisional government called the Provisional People's Committee was formed under Kim Il-sung, who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in Manchuria. Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants manoeuvred to gain positions of power in the new government. In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land-reform program: land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers. Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural labourers under the people's committees, a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes. Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land, thereby making for a far more equal distribution of land. The North Korean land reform was achieved in a less violent way than in China or in Vietnam. Official American sources stated: \"From all accounts, the former village leaders were eliminated as a political force without resort to bloodshed, but extreme care was taken to preclude their return to power.\" The farmers responded positively; many collaborators, former landowners and Christians fled to the south, where some of them obtained positions in the new South Korean government. According to the U.S. military government, 400,000 northern Koreans went south as refugees.\n\nKey industries were nationalized. The economic situation was nearly as difficult in the north as it was in the south, as the Japanese had concentrated agriculture and service industries in the south and heavy industry in the north.\n\nSoviet forces departed in 1948.\n\nUS occupation of southern Korea\n\nWith the American government fearing Soviet expansion, and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum, the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times. On 7 September 1945, General Douglas MacArthur announced that Lieutenant General John R. Hodge was to administer Korean affairs, and Hodge landed in Incheon with his troops the next day.\nMacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ended up being in charge of southern Korea from 1945 to 1948 due to the lack of clear orders or initiative from Washington, D.C. There was no plan or guideline given to MacArthur from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State Department on how to rule Korea. Hodge directly reported to MacArthur and GHQ (General Headquarters) in Tokyo, not to Washington, D.C., during the military occupation. The three year period of the U.S. Army occupation was chaotic and tumultuous compared to the very peaceful and stable U.S. occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952. Hodge and his XXIV Corps were trained for combat, not for diplomacy and negotiating with the many diverse political groups that emerged in post-colonial southern Korea: former Japanese collaborators, pro-Soviet communists, anti-Soviet communists, right wing groups, and Korean nationalists. None of the Americans in the military or the State Department in the Far East in late 1945 even spoke Korean, leading to local Koreans joking about how Korean translators were really running southern Korea. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them. Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People's Republic of Korea and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.\n\nJapanese civilians were repatriated, including nearly all industrial managers and technicians; over 500,000 by December 1945 and 786,000 by August 1946.  Severe price inflation occurred in the disrupted economy, until in summer 1946 rationing and price controls were imposed.\n\nIn September 1946, thousands of laborers and peasants rose up against the military government. This uprising was quickly defeated, and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly. The opening of the Assembly was delayed to December to investigate widespread allegations of electoral fraud.\n\nArdent anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US, became the most prominent politician in the South. Rhee pressured the American government to abandon negotiations for a trusteeship and create an independent Republic of Korea in the south. On 19 July 1947, Lyuh Woon-hyung, the last senior politician committed to left-right dialogue, was assassinated by a 19-year-old man named Han Chigeun, a recent refugee from North Korea and an active member of a nationalist right-wing group.\n\nThe occupation government and then the newly formed South Korean government conducted a number of military campaigns against left-wing insurgents. Over the course of the next few years, between 30,000 and 100,000 people were killed. Most casualties resulted from the Jeju Uprising.\n\nUS\u2013Soviet Joint Commission\nIn December 1945, at the Moscow Conference, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union, the US, the Republic of China, and Britain would take part in a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. Many Koreans demanded independence immediately; however, the Korean Communist Party, which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party, supported the trusteeship. According to journalist Fyodor Tertitskiy, documentation from 1945 suggests the Soviet government had no plans for a permanent division.\n\nA  met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration, but failed to make progress due to increasing Cold War antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship. In 1946, the Soviet Union proposed Lyuh Woon-hyung as the leader of a unified Korea, but this was rejected by the US. Meanwhile, the division between the two zones deepened. The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics, and a transfer of population between North and South. In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit. At the final meeting of the Joint Commission in September 1947, Soviet delegate Terentii Shtykov proposed that both Soviet and US troops withdraw and give the Korean people the opportunity to form their own government. This was rejected by the US.\n\nUN intervention and the formation of separate governments\n\nWith the failure of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US brought the problem before the United Nations in September 1947. The Soviet Union opposed UN involvement. The UN passed a resolution on 14 November 1947, declaring that free elections should be held, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and a UN commission for Korea, the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK), should be created. The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections. In the absence of Soviet co-operation, it was decided to hold UN-supervised elections in the south only. This was in defiance of the report of the chairman of the commission, K. P. S. Menon, who had argued against a separate election. Some UNTCOK delegates felt that the conditions in the south gave unfair advantage to right-wing candidates, but they were overruled.\n\nThe decision to proceed with separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly saw it as a prelude to a permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948. In April, Jeju islanders rose up against the looming division of the country. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. Tens of thousands of islanders were killed and by one estimate, 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops. The uprising flared up again with the outbreak of the Korean War.\n\nIn April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in Pyongyang. The southern politicians Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties. The conference called for a united government and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Syngman Rhee and General Hodge denounced the conference. Kim Koo was assassinated the following year.\n\nOn 10 May 1948 the south held a general election. It took place amid widespread violence and intimidation, as well as a boycott by opponents of Syngman Rhee. On 15 August, the \"Republic of Korea\" (Daehan Minguk) formally took over power from the U.S. military, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. In the North, the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (Chos\u014fn Minjuju\u016di Inmin Konghwaguk) was declared on 9 September, with Kim Il-sung as prime minister.\n\nOn 12 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the report of UNTCOK and declared the Republic of Korea to be the \"only lawful government in Korea\". However, none of the members of UNTCOK considered that the election had established a legitimate national parliament. The Australian government, which had a representative on the commission declared that it was \"far from satisfied\" with the election.\n\nUnrest continued in the South. In October 1948, the Yeosu\u2013Suncheon rebellion took place, in which some regiments rejected the suppression of the Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government. In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the Bodo League in order to keep an eye on its political opponents. The majority of the Bodo League's members were innocent farmers and civilians who were forced into membership. The registered members or their families were executed at the beginning of the Korean War. On 24 December 1949, South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers or their family and affixed blame to communists.\n\nKorean War\n\nThis division of Korea, after more than a millennium of being unified, was seen as controversial and temporary by both regimes. From 1948 until the start of the civil war on 25 June 1950, the armed forces of each side engaged in a series of bloody conflicts along the border. In 1950, these conflicts escalated dramatically when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering the Korean War. The United Nations intervened to protect the South, sending a US-led force. As it occupied the south, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea attempted to unify Korea under its regime, initiating the nationalisation of industry, land reform, and the restoration of the People's Committees.\n\nWhile UN intervention was conceived as restoring the border at the 38th parallel, Syngman Rhee argued that the attack of the North had obliterated the boundary. Similarly UN Commander in Chief, General Douglas MacArthur stated that he intended to unify Korea, not just drive the North Korean forces back behind the border. However, the North overran 90% of the south until a counter-attack by US-led forces. As the North Korean forces were driven from the south, South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel on 1 October, and American and other UN forces followed a week later. This was despite warnings from the People's Republic of China that it would intervene if American troops crossed the parallel. As it occupied the north, the Republic of Korea, in turn, attempted to unify the country under its regime, with the Korean National Police enforcing political indoctrination. As US-led forces pushed into the north, China unleashed a counter-attack which drove them back into the south.\n\nIn 1951, the front line stabilized near the 38th parallel, and both sides began to consider an armistice. Rhee, however, demanded the war continue until Korea was unified under his leadership. The Communist side supported an armistice line being based on the 38th parallel, but the United Nations supported a line based on the territory held by each side, which was militarily defensible. The UN position, formulated by the Americans, went against the consensus leading up to the negotiations. Initially, the Americans proposed a line that passed through Pyongyang, far to the north of the front line. The Chinese and North Koreans eventually agreed to a border on the military line of contact rather than the 38th parallel, but this disagreement led to a tortuous and drawn-out negotiating process.\n\nArmistice\n\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement was signed after three years of war. The two sides agreed to create a  buffer zone between the states, known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This new border, reflecting the territory held by each side at the end of the war, crossed the 38th parallel diagonally. Rhee refused to accept the armistice and continued to urge the reunification of the country by force. Despite attempts by both sides to reunify the country, the war perpetuated the division of Korea and led to a permanent alliance between South Korea and the U.S., and a permanent U.S. garrison in the South.\n\nAs dictated by the terms of the Korean Armistice, a Geneva Conference was held in 1954 on the Korean question. Despite efforts by many of the nations involved, the conference ended without a declaration for a unified Korea.\n\nThe Armistice established a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) which was tasked to monitor the Armistice. Since 1953, members of the Swiss and Swedish armed forces have been members of the NNSC stationed near the DMZ.  Poland and Czechoslovakia were the neutral nations chosen by North Korea, but North Korea expelled their observers after those countries embraced capitalism.\n\nPost-armistice relations\n\nSince the war, Korea has remained divided along the DMZ. North and South have remained in a state of conflict, with the opposing regimes both claiming to be the legitimate government of the whole country. Sporadic negotiations have failed to produce lasting progress towards reunification.\n\nOn 27 April 2018 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Panmunjom Declaration signed by both leaders called for the end of longstanding military activities near the border and the reunification of Korea.\n\nOn 1 November 2018, buffer zones were established across the DMZ to help ensure the end of hostility on land, sea and air. The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea. In addition, no fly zones were established.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nPeriod dramas\nEyes of Dawn (1991-1992 MBC television series)\nRustic Period (2002-2003 SBS television series)\nSeoul 1945 (2006 KBS1 television series)\n\nSee also\n\n List of border incidents involving North and South Korea\n Korean conflict\n Korean reunification\n North Korea\u2013South Korea relations\n History of North Korea\n History of South Korea\n Partition of Vietnam\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Fields, David.

The division followed the line of the 38th parallel north of which the United States placed the Korean people under their immediate military control and south of the line was a Soviet occupation zone. The division of Korea initially meant the separation of only the people living in each respective occupation zone, but soon it became a political and ideological division. The division of Korea led to a civil war between the two Koreas. This division was also heavily influenced by external powers, in particular the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two Koreas were rivals from the very start and any attempt at reunification was seen as a threat to their respective political alliance systems. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, both the United States and the Soviet Union sought to establish their respective spheres of influence in Korea, with the United States supporting the South and the Soviet Union supporting the North. This led to constant tensions and occasional clashes along the 38th Parallel, which was eventually transformed into the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone that continues to this day. Today, the division of Korea is considered to be one of the longest-running unresolved international disputes in the world. The two Koreas maintain a cross-border impasse, with the North refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the South, and the South refusing to enter an alliance with the North. The division of Korea has, however, been partially overcome through a variety of initiatives, most notably in 2018 when North Korea and South Korea declared an end to their decades-long war, committing to an eventual reunification and peace. The two leaders also signed an agreement of demilitarization of the Korean peninsula and to a mutual agreement not to intervene in the other's domestic affairs. The division of Korea has since been a major obstacle to peace and economic development in the Korean Peninsula, and to the stability of Northeast Asia as a whole. While the long-term goal of many is the peaceful reunification of Korea, it is widely believed that this will only occur if South and North Korea develop a sense of shared sovereignty. The inter-Korean relationship has rapidly improved since 2018 and dialogue and trust between the two sides is gradually growing. Until a sustainable solution is achieved, the division of Korea will remain a highly contested issue in international affairs.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 325746}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monte Titano\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Monte Titano (\"Mount Titan\") is a mountain of the Apennines and the highest peak in San Marino. It stands  above sea level and is located immediately to the east of the capital, San Marino. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008 under the combined title \"San Marino Historic Centre and Mount Titano\". Inscribed under reference no. 1245 criteria iii, the two together encompass an area of 55 ha with a buffer zone of 167 ha. It encompasses Mount Titano and the other structures such as the fortification towers, walls, gates and bastions, as well as a neo-classical basilica located on it and its slopes forming a small but unique urban conglomerate.\n\nStraddled on the ridge of  Mount Titano is the city of San Marino of the Republic of San Marino, the history of which dates from the early 4th century. According to the legend related to the Mount and its precincts, a small monastery existed on top of the Mount during the 8th century. The mountainous landscape provides excellent views of its surroundings, and its isolated location ensured the needed seclusion for San Marino to survive as a Republic over the past several centuries.\n\nThe mountain has three peaks; on each is one of The Three Towers of San Marino. Saint Marinus is always represented with Mount Titano in his hands.\n\nGeography and environment\nMonte Titano is located in central San Marino (seen in maps in rough rectangular shape), to the southeast of the City of San Marino and to the north of the village of Murata, at a distance of  from the Adriatic Coast. Monte Titano looks like a rugged limestone outcrop, located only 13 kilometres (a figure of 10\u00a0km is mentioned in another reference) from the Adriatic Sea on the Apennines. Although the highest point is 739 metres above sea level, the rocky outcrop is about 200 metres in height at most. From the top of Monte Titano views of the entire nation of San Marino and further afield can be viewed scenically. The mountain gives birth to several streams, including the San Marino River, which flows down its western slope through a broad valley and flows into the Marecchia River, through Marecchia Torello and into the Adriatic Sea  away and the Cando River, born in Marano, which flows into the Adriatic coast between Rimini and Riccione Ausa. The terrain has fertile soils in Emilia Romagna plain and soft rolling hills in the Marche and Montefeltro region. The mountain dips into the calm Adriatic sea.\n\nDuring the Tertiary era, the area where San Marino lies was the sea. Violent earthquakes caused major upheavals in the Earth's surface. Because of these intensive earthquakes, a mass of rock situated about  from the mountain, was lifted and slid slowly toward the Adriatic Sea. This mass of rock gave rise to various mountains, including Mount Titano. The vertebrate fossils found on the slopes of Mount Titano are mostly aquatic in origin, because of the fact this rock was once located underneath the sea in its current spot. Fossils of various fish, especially the fossils of shark teeth have been discovered on Monte Titano, with many dated to the Miocene period. The most important fossil discovery is that of a whale, which is now preserved in the Bologna Archaeological Museum.\n\nThe precincts of Monte Titano and the San Marino city experiences mild temperate climate; the maximum temperatures reported is of 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) in summer while the minimum is 19\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) in winter. Annual precipitation varies from about 22\u00a0inches (560\u00a0mm) to 32\u00a0inches (800\u00a0mm).\n\nFlora and fauna\nSet in the Mediterranean zone the vegetation is typical influenced by elevation variations. Numerous trees inhabit the mountain, including chestnuts, oaks, laburnum, cypress, fir trees and some shrubs and asparagus, typical of the driest areas, such as the territory in the Three Towers of San Marino vicinity. On the cliffs of Mount Titano is also found Ephedra Nebrodensis, a plant typical of Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nWildlife is represented by all classes of vertebrates and, given the characteristics of the mountainous territory, birds and mammals are the most common animals. In relation to birds, several can be mentioned such as the kestrel, barn owl, owl, tawny owl, the magpie and buzzards.  Common animal life includes roe deer, wild boar, deer, weasels, marten, porcupine, hare, hedgehogs, polecats, badgers and foxes.\n\nProtected area\nSince 2008, Monte Titano was allocated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in tandem with the historic centre of San Marino. The reason given by the Committee refers to \"witnessing the continuity of a free republic since Middle Ages. \" This heritage site include the towers, walls, gates and bastions of the City of San Marino, the Basilica di San Marino of the nineteenth century, some convents of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the eighteenth century Teatro Titano Theatre and the Palazzo Pubblico of the nineteenth century.\n\nCulture\n\nThe layout of the Mount Titano presents three peaks, each crowned by ancient towers named Guaita, Cesta and Montale, with triple fortifications that enclose the capital city. Each tower, in turn, has a metal vane fixed on it which is in the shape of an ostrich plume, (\"perhaps a pun on the Italian penne, meaning \"plumes\") which is attributed to the name of the mountains. Those three towers are represented in the coat of arms in the central part of the National Flag (horizontal white and blue) of the country (which has a width to length ratio of 3 to 4). The capital city is set on the western side of Mount Titano. An urban network of roads links the fortresses.\n\nReferences\n\nMountains of San Marino\nWorld Heritage Sites in San Marino\nGeography of the City of San Marino\nHighest points of countries", "machine_text": " Monte Titano is a 739-metre (2,425 ft) mountain located in the heart of San Marino, the world's fifth smallest sovereign state. It is the highest of the three peaks, Monte Titano being the tallest one, which make up the country of San Marino. An ancient fortress, the Guaita was built on top of Monte Titano in the 11th century and it remains as a symbol of San Marino's independence. This picturesque mountain is a popular tourist destination, and offers an unparalleled view of the surrounding area. The earliest mention of Monte Titano is in an 885 land grant from the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles the Fat, to the tiny Christian community of San Marino. This document is still kept in the archives of the state and is the basis of San Marino's national holiday, November 3. Throughout the centuries, Monte Titano has been the site of many defensive fortifications. The Three Towers of San Marino, known as La Cesta, La Montale, and La Guaita, are situated at the top of Monte Titano and form the nucleus of the city. Each of them is over 1,000 years old and part of the first line of defense for the city of San Marino. La Guaita, the oldest and most impressive of the three towers, was built at the highest point of Monte Titano and it is the most famous of the three. It is a four-story building made of pale gray sandstone, its battleship-like silhouette reminiscent of a battleship. Today, Monte Titano stands as a proud symbol of San Marino's unwavering commitment to its independence and freedom. From the Three Towers of San Marino to the beautiful wooded valleys, Monte Titano offers some of the most breathtaking views of the countryside that can be enjoyed by visitors. Besides offering stunning views of the Apennines, the mountain provides unique recreational opportunities to those looking for adventure or simply for the peace and quiet that the natural surroundings of Monte Titano provide. Aside from its glorious historical buildings, outdoor activities on Monte Titano range from leisurely hikes and biking routes to sportive climbing routes. Monte Titano is a popular destination for travelers who want to explore the culture of San Marino as well as its stunning natural surroundings. It remains an integral part of San Marino history and many locals refer to it as \u201cthe mountain of freedom\u201d. With its impressive past, stunning vistas and plethora of outdoor activities, Monte Titano will remain a popular destination for many generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7157834}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Betty Hutton\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Betty Hutton (born Elizabeth June Thornburg; February 26, 1921 \u2013 March 12, 2007)\nwas an American stage, film, and television actress, comedian, dancer, and singer.\n\nEarly life and education\nHutton was born Elizabeth June Thornburg on February 26, 1921, in Battle Creek, Michigan. While she was very young, her father abandoned the family for another woman. They did not hear of him again until they received a telegram in 1937, informing them of his suicide. Betty and her older sister, Marion, were raised by her alcoholic mother, who took the surname Hutton.  Marion was later billed as the actress Sissy Jones.\n\nThe three started singing in the family's speakeasy when Betty was 3 years old. Troubles with the police kept the family on the move.  They eventually landed in Detroit, where she attended Foch Intermediate School. On one occasion, when Betty, preceded by a police escort, arrived at the premiere of Let's Dance (1950), her mother, arriving with her, quipped, \"At least this time the police are in front of us!\"  Hutton sang in several local bands as a teenager, and at one point visited New York City hoping to perform on Broadway, where she was rejected.\n\nEarly career\nA few years later, she was scouted by orchestra leader Vincent Lopez, who gave Hutton her entry into the entertainment business.\n\nShe appeared in several musical shorts for Warner Bros., Queens of the Air (1938), Three Kings and a Queen (1939), Public Jitterbug No. 1 (1939), and One for the Book (1940).\n\nBroadway\nHutton was cast in a Broadway show, Two for the Show (1940), which ran for 124 performances.\n\nThe show was produced by Buddy DeSylva, who then cast Hutton in Panama Hattie (1940\u201342). This was a major hit, running for 501 performances. It starred Ethel Merman; despite rumors through the years that Merman demanded from envy that Hutton's musical numbers be reduced from the show, more careful reports demonstrate that producer Buddy DeSylva chose to cut just one song of three, \"They Ain't Done Right by Our Nell\", due to Hutton's \"always in overdrive\" performance style.\n\nParamount\n\nEarly films\nWhen DeSylva became a producer at Paramount Pictures, Hutton was signed to a featured role in The Fleet's In (1942), starring Paramount's number-one female star Dorothy Lamour, alongside Eddie Bracken and William Holden. The film was popular and Hutton was an instant hit with the moviegoing public.\n\nHutton was one of the many Paramount contract artists who appeared in Star Spangled Rhythm (1942). The studio did not immediately promote her to major stardom, but did give her the second lead in a Mary Martin film musical, Happy Go Lucky (1943). The response was positive, and Hutton was given co-star billing with Bob Hope in Let's Face It (1943). During that year, she made $1250 per week.\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan's Creek\nIn 1942, writer-director  Preston Sturges cast Betty as the dopey but endearing small-town girl who gives local troops a happy send-off and wakes up married and pregnant, but with no memory of who her husband is, except that  a few \"z's\" were in his name.  This film, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, was delayed by Hays Office objections and Sturges' prolific output, and was finally released early in 1944.\n\nThe film made Hutton a major star;  Sturges was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar, the film was named to the National Film Board's Top Ten films for the year, and the National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture of 1944, and awarded Betty Hutton the award for Best Acting for her performance. The New York Times named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942\u20131944.\n\nCritic James Agee noted that \"the Hays office must have been raped in its sleep\" to allow the film to be released. And although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of the film's subject matter, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1944, playing to standing room-only audiences in some theatres.\n\nParamount kept Hutton busy, putting her in And the Angels Sing (1944) with Fred MacMurray and Dorothy Lamour, and Here Come the Waves (1944) with Bing Crosby. Both were huge hits.\n\nOn the strength of Hutton's success,  she signed a recording contract with the newly formed  Capitol Records (she was one of the earliest artists to do so).\n\nBuddy DeSylva, one of Capitol's founders, also co-produced her next hit, the musical Incendiary Blonde (1945), where she played Texas Guinan. It was directed by veteran comedy director George Marshall and Hutton had replaced Lamour as Paramount's top female box-office attraction.\n\nHutton was one of many Paramount stars in Duffy's Tavern (1945), and was top billed in The Stork Club (1945) with Barry Fitzgerald, produced by DeSyvla.\n\nHutton went into Cross My Heart (1946) with Sonny Tufts, which she disliked. She did however enjoy the hugely popular The Perils of Pauline (1947), directed by Marshall, where she sang a Frank Loesser song that was nominated for an Oscar: \"I Wish I Didn't Love You So\".\n\nHutton's relationship with Paramount began to disintegrate when DeSylva left the studio due to illness (he died in 1950). \"After I left I started doing scripts that I knew weren't good for me.\"\n\nHutton made Dream Girl (1948) with MacDonald Carey, which she later said, \"almost ruined me.\" She did Red, Hot and Blue (1949) with Victor Mature, which she also disliked.\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun\n\nHutton's next screen triumph came in Annie Get Your Gun (1950) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which hired her to replace Judy Garland in the role of Annie Oakley. The film, with the leading role retooled for Hutton, was a smash hit, with the biggest critical praise going to Hutton.\n\nShe was billed above Fred Astaire in the 1950 musical Let's Dance. \n\nHutton was one of several stars in The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). She made an unbilled cameo in Sailor Beware (1952) with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, a remake of The Fleet's In, in which she portrayed Dean's girlfriend, Hetty Button.\n\nShe made Somebody Loves Me (1952), a biography of singer Blossom Seeley, with Ralph Meeker.\n\nHutton then clashed with Paramount. The New York Times reported that the dispute resulted from her insistence that her husband at the time, choreographer Charles O'Curran, direct her in a film.\n\nIn April 1952, Hutton returned to Broadway, performing in Betty Hutton and Her All-Star International Show.\n\nIn July 1952, she announced her husband and she would form a production company. She left Paramount in August.\n\nTelevision and theatre\nHutton got work in radio, appeared in Las Vegas, where she had a great success.\n\nShe had the rights to a script about Sophie Tucker, but was unable to raise funds.\n\nIn 1954, TV producer Max Liebman, of comedian Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, fashioned his first \"Color Spectacular\" as an original musical written especially for Hutton, Satins and Spurs.\n\nHutton's last completed film was a small one, Spring Reunion (1957). It was a financial disappointment. She also became disillusioned with Capitol's management and moved to RCA Victor.\n\nIn 1957, she appeared on a Dinah Shore show on NBC that also featured Boris Karloff; the program has been preserved on a kinescope.\n\nThe Betty Hutton Show\nLucille Ball and Desi Arnaz took a chance on Hutton in 1959, with their company  Desilu Productions giving her a CBS sitcom, The Betty Hutton Show. Hutton hired the still-blacklisted and future film composer Jerry Fielding to direct her series. They had met over the years in Las Vegas when he was blacklisted from TV and radio and could get no other work, and her Hollywood career was also fading. It was Fielding's first network job since losing his post as musical director of Groucho Marx's You Bet Your Life in 1953 after hostile questioning by HUAC. The Betty Hutton Show ended after 30 episodes.\n\nHutton continued headlining in Las Vegas and touring across the country. She returned to Broadway briefly in 1964 when she temporarily replaced a hospitalized Carol Burnett in the show Fade Out \u2013 Fade In.\n\nShe guest-starred on shows such as The Greatest Show on Earth, Burke's Law, and Gunsmoke.\n\nIn 1967, she was signed to star in two low-budget Westerns for Paramount, but was fired shortly after the projects began.\n\nLife after Hollywood\n\nAfter the 1967 death of her mother in a house fire, and the collapse of her last marriage, Hutton's depression and pill addictions escalated. She divorced her fourth husband, jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli, when she discovered he had fallen in love with Edie Adams (who would become Candoli's second wife).  She declared bankruptcy the same year.\n\nAfter losing her singing voice in 1970, Hutton had a nervous breakdown and later attempted suicide. She regained control of her life through rehabilitation, and the mentorship of a Roman Catholic priest, Father Peter Maguire. Hutton converted to Roman Catholicism, and took a job as a cook at a rectory in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. She made national headlines when it was revealed she was practically penniless and working in a rectory. After an aborted comeback in 1974, she was hospitalized with emotional exhaustion. Later that year, a well-publicized \"Love-In for Betty Hutton\" was held at New York City's Riverboat Restaurant, emceed by comedian Joey Adams, with several old Hollywood pals on hand. The event raised $10,000 for Hutton and gave her spirits a big boost, but steady work still eluded her.\n\nHutton appeared in an interview with Mike Douglas and a brief guest appearance in 1975 on Baretta. In 1977, Hutton was featured on The Phil Donahue Show. She was then happily employed as hostess at a Newport, Rhode Island, jai alai arena.\n\nShe also appeared on Good Morning America, which led to a 1978 televised reunion with her two daughters. Hutton began living in a shared home with her divorced daughter and grandchildren in California, but returned to the East Coast for a three-week return to the stage.\n\nAnnie\nIn 1980, she took over the role of Miss Hannigan during the original Broadway production of Annie while Alice Ghostley was on vacation. Ghostley replaced the original Miss Hannigan actress, Dorothy Loudon (who won a Tony Award for the role).\n\nHutton's rehearsal of the song \"Little Girls\" was featured on Good Morning America. Hutton's Broadway comeback was also included in a profile on CBS News Sunday Morning about her life, her struggle with pills, and her recovery.\n\nA ninth-grade drop-out, Hutton went back to school and earned a master's degree in psychology from Salve Regina University in 1986. During her time at college, Hutton became friends with singer-songwriter Kristin Hersh and attended several early concerts of Hersh's band, Throwing Muses.  Hersh later wrote the song \"Elizabeth June\" as a tribute to her friend, and wrote about their relationship in further detail in her memoir, Rat Girl.\n\nHutton's last known performance, in any medium, was on Jukebox Saturday Night, which aired on PBS in 1983. Hutton stayed in New England and began teaching comedic acting at Boston's Emerson College. She became estranged again from her daughters.\n\nFinal years\nAfter the death of her ally, Father Maguire, Hutton returned to California, moving to Palm Springs in 1999, after decades in New England. Hutton hoped to grow closer to her daughters and grandchildren, as she told Robert Osborne on TCM's Private Screenings in April 2000, though her children remained distant. She told Osborne that she understood their hesitancy to accept a now elderly mother. The TCM interview first aired on July 18, 2000. The program was rerun as a memorial on the evening of her death in 2007, and again on July 11, 2008, April 14, 2009, January 26, 2010, and as recently as March 18, 2017. as part of TCM's memorial tribute for Robert Osborne.\n\nHutton lived in Palm Springs until her death March 12, 2007, at 86, from colon cancer complications. She is buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nHutton's first marriage was to camera manufacturer Ted Briskin in 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1951. Two daughters were born to the couple:\n Lindsay Diane Briskin, born in Barcelona, Spain, on March 1, 1946\n Candice Elizabeth Briskin, born in Havana, Cuba, on December 3, 1947\n\nHutton's second marriage in 1952 was to choreographer Charles O'Curran. They divorced in 1955. He died in 1984.\n\nShe married husband Alan W. Livingston in 1955, weeks after her divorce from O'Curran. They divorced in 1960.\n\nHer fourth and final marriage in 1960 was to jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. They divorced in 1967. Hutton and Candoli had one child:\n Carolyn Candoli, born on March 9, 1961\n\nHutton was once engaged to the head of the Warner Bros. makeup department, makeup artist Perc Westmore, in 1942, but broke off the engagement, saying it was because he bored her.\n\nLegacy\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Betty Hutton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6259 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHit songs\n\nFilmography\n\nBox-office ranking\nFor several years, film exhibitors voted Hutton among the leading stars in the country:\n 1944 \u2013 25th (US)\n 1950 \u2013 15th (US)\n 1951 \u2013 9th (UK)\n 1952 \u2013 14th (US), 3rd (UK)\n\nStage work\n Two for the Show (1940)\n Panama Hattie (1940)\n Betty Hutton and Her All-Star International Show (1952)\n Gypsy (1962)\n South Pacific (1962)\n Annie Get Your Gun (1963)\n Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1964)\n Fade Out \u2013 Fade In (1964) (replacement for Carol Burnett)\n Mary, Mary (1965)\n Here Today (1966)\n Here Today (1972)\n Anything Goes (1973)\n Annie (1980) (replacement for Alice Ghostley)\n\nRadio appearances\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nIn popular culture\n\nHer songs \"He's a Demon - He's a Devil - He's a Doll\" and \"It's a Man\" are featured in the open-world video game, Fallout 4, on the in-game radio.\n\nHer song \"Murder, He Says\" appeared in Woody Allen's 1989 film, Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Betty Hutton, Backstage You Can Have: My Own Story, 2009.

She was known for her zany comedic roles in films such as The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944) and Annie Get Your Gun (1950). Hutton was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, and grew up in the bright lights of vaudeville. Her father (a vaudeville actor and comedian) guided her career until his death in 1940 when she was 19. After his passing, she came under the direction of fellow Battle Creek resident Charles Z. Taft, who instructed her to do more singing and dancing on the stage, instead of her usual funny straight lines. This move paid off, and Hutton soon made her Broadway debut. In 1942, Hutton caught the attention of Paramount Pictures and was signed to a contract. She was cast in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944) starring Eddie Bracken and Dennis O'Keefe. It was a hit, and Hutton appeared in several other films, including Incendiary Blonde (1945), Hold That Blonde! (1945), and Cross My Heart (1946). Her star reached its zenith in 1950 with the musical comedy Annie Get Your Gun, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was a huge success, grossing more than $7 million at the box office, making it one of the highest-grossing movies of 1950. Hutton did not fare as well in the following years. Her star began to wane, and in 1953 she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Female Newcomer. Though she had a few hit movies after that, her career was in decline by the end of the 1950s. She left Hollywood for a few years and made a few guest appearances on TV shows, including The Red Skelton Show in 1960. In 1961, she attempted a comeback, but her career never fully recovered. From then on, she made appearances on stage and television, making guest appearances on variety shows and appearing in summer stock. In 1965, Hutton was cast in the Broadway version of Barefoot in the Park, opposite Robert Redford. Hutton was married four times and had one daughter. She died of natural causes on March 11, 2007, in Palm Springs, California. Though her career may have been short-lived, she made a lasting impression on the cinematic world. Her zany comedic roles are still fondly remembered by audiences and will continue to live on in her films.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 327880}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Suicide of Tyler Clementi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 \u2013 September 22, 2010) was an American student at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River at the age of 18, on September 22, 2010. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred.\n\nRavi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012, on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016.\n\nClementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.\n\nBackground\nClementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.\n\nA few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \"basically completely rejected\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \"sad\" and \"quiet\" as she processed the information and that she \"felt a little betrayed\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \"confident\" and \"comfortable\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.\n\nRavi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on JustUsBoys, a pornographic website and message board for gay men, and tweeted \"Found out my roommate is gay\". Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.\n\nWebcam incidents\n\nFirst viewings\nOn the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.\n\nOn September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\"\n\nSecond attempt\nOn September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39\u00a0p.m., Ravi tweeted, \"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.\n\nThe same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11\u00a0p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\" Clementi wrote in detail on the JustUsBoys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWithin a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.\n\nSuicide\n\nOn the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30\u00a0p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42\u00a0p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry\".\n\nClementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.\n\nClementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well.\n\nReaction\nShortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\" The same month Clementi died, four other Americans were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.\n\nAt Rutgers University\nRutgers University students planned a \"Black Friday\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\"\n\nBeginning in the 2011\u20132012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.\n\nBy September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.\n\nCharitable response\nIn 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.\n\nGovernment\nTyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying. US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\" and added, \"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today\u2014I can't.\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71\u20131 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30\u20130 vote in the New Jersey Senate.\n\nThe San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.\n\nParents' statements\nThe day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people:\n\nIn the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:\n\nAdvocacy\nIn the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death.\n\nThe incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \"Spirit Day\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.\n\nHowever, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \"pervasive in our culture\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \"the last straw\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not die by suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \"mob mentality\" that focuses on \"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \"adults and institutions\" in society who \"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\", and he concludes that to \"pin all the blame\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \"a coverup\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient\u2014a slap on the wrist.\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\"\n\nThe Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015.\n\nCriticism of media coverage\nSoon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \"media floodgate of distortion\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\"\n\nIn popular culture\nEllen DeGeneres described herself as \"devastated\" by Clementi's death, stating, \"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\"\n\nThe band Rise Against released a song, \"Make It Stop (September's Children)\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other young people who died by suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.\n\nMadonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have died by suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \"The Secret Seven\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.\n\nMonica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.\n\nCourt case\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.\n\nOn March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India.\n\nIn February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.\n\nSee also \n\n The Trevor Project\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Tyler Clementi Foundation\n Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship\n \n\n2010 in LGBT history\n2010 in New York City\nBullying and suicide\nCollege students who committed suicide\nDeaths by person in the United States\nGay history\nLGBT history in New York City\nSuicide of Tyler Clementi\nSuicides by jumping in New York City\nVictims of cyberbullying\nDiscrimination against LGBT people in the United States\nBullying in the United States\nSeptember 2010 events in the United States\nLGBT-related suicides\n2010 suicides\n20th-century LGBT people\n21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": " Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 - September 22, 2010) was an American student who attended Rutgers University. In September 2010, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in New York City. His death was the result of cyberbullying reportedly brought on by his college roommates, who had spied on him when he was having a romantic meeting with another man. Clementi was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey and was the son of Joseph and Jane Clementi. He attended Ridgewood High School where he was an accomplished violinist. He was a member of the local orchestra. After high school, he attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he was studying science. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, and another student, Molly Wei, used a webcam to secretly film him during a romantic encounter with another man. The video was then posted on the internet. The incident received national media attention and sparked intense public outcry against cyberbullying and gay bias. Clementi discovered the footage and posted a short tweet on September 21, which read, \u201cJumping off the gw bridge sorry.\" On the night of September 22, he posted a final Facebook status saying, \"jumping off the gw bridge, goodbye.\" The next day, Clementi's body was identified when it washed up on the Hudson River shoreline. His death was ruled as a suicide. Although both Ravi and Wei were initially charged with invasion of privacy and related crimes, both eventually accepted plea deals, which included no jail time. Clementi's death prompted a national debate on cyberbullying and ultimately led to the passage of new anti bullying laws throughout the United States. Many universities and organizations have established awards in honor of Clementi's memory, such as the Tyler Clementi Foundation, dedicated to ending bullying and creating safe online environments for young adults. Tyler Clementi's legacy lives on in the fight against online and in-person bullying. His tragedy has been immortalized in novels, documentaries, and musicals. He will always be remembered as a symbol of hope and justice, as well as a reminder of the consequences of cyberbullying.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Forgive Me (TV series)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Forgive Me is a Canadian television drama series, about a young insomniac priest who gets caught up in the sins of his congregants while a secret from his own past threatens his calling.\n\nThe series is written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald. It stars Mike McLeod, John Dunsworth, Jane Alexander, Hugh Thompson, Olympia Dukakis, Brenda Fricker, Wendy Crewson, Bruce Davison, Jeremy Akerman, Ryan Doucette, Candy Palmater, Ed Asner, Gharrett Patrick Paon and Rob Joseph Leonard.\n\nThe series began its original broadcast on September 4, 2013 on Super Channel in Canada. It aired its second season in 2015, and its third in 2018.\n\nPlot\nThe Priest (Mike McLeod), whose actual name is never given throughout the series, is the junior priest at a Roman Catholic church in Nova Scotia. With young men now rarely joining the Catholic priesthood, he is serving under a Prelate (John Dunsworth) and older priests Gene (Jeremy Akerman) and Phil (Rob Joseph Leonard), who are all near retirement; he is planned to eventually take over as the parish's main pastor, but currently performs lesser duties such as hearing confessions. The Priest comes from a dysfunctional family background; he was raised primarily by his grandmother Novalea (Olympia Dukakis) after his mother abandoned the family, while his brother was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and has frequently bounced in and out of jail for various crimes.\n\nIn the first episode, The Priest learns that Victoria (Naomi Blackhall-Butler), his girlfriend before he entered the seminary, lied to him when she got pregnant with his baby; she claimed at the time that she had an abortion, but did not. In fact, he has a teenage daughter named Noelle (Lauren Liem), and thus faces the dilemma of how to take parental responsibility for her on a priest's salary while simultaneously preventing the parish and the bishop (Ed Asner) from finding out about it. At the same time, he is having trouble sleeping at night and is regularly haunted by visions of Saint Sebastian (Ryan Doucette), which is beginning to impact his physical health.\n\nThe centrepiece of each episode is an extended dialogue in the confessional booth between The Priest and a parishioner; outside of this, however, plot development takes place through multi-episode story arcs rather than each episode comprising a self-contained story, and the show carries the stories of a few confessioners through multiple episodes rather than featuring new confessioners every week. The confessions serve to explore both themes of moral complexity within Roman Catholic doctrine, and the ethical dilemmas facing The Priest as he tries to get involved in helping the parishioners with their issues outside the confession booth.\n\nThe show's main narrative throughline begins with the confession of Johnny \"Smith\" O'Leary (Hugh Thompson), who initially confesses to having had inappropriate sexual thoughts about an underage girl, but soon reveals that he was himself sexually abused as a child by a former choirmaster at this very church and that Father Gene was involved in covering it up, setting up The Priest's biggest ethical conflict as he cannot help O'Leary to pursue justice and healing without breaking the Seal of the Confessional or undermining his own employer. Secondary storylines include the journey of Bookie (Jane Alexander), a woman who left the church decades earlier after being told that she could not have an abortion even to end a non-viable pregnancy that would have killed her, toward reconciliation with the church after she is diagnosed with terminal cancer; the desire of Agnes (Candy Palmater) to become a single mother through in vitro fertilization; Sebastian's emergence as a real person who challenges The Priest over the church's position on homosexuality; and the struggles of Celeste (Wendy Crewson), a former federal Member of Parliament who lost her job as a media pundit after her role in a political scandal was revealed.\n\nCritical response\nThe series was generally well-received, attaining positive reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail compared it to In Treatment, praised Mike McLeod's performance as \"superb\", noted \"a visual sumptuousness that's startling\" and called it \"a powerful 30 minutes of television.\" Brad Oswald of the Winnipeg Free Press wrote \"The confessional-confined dialogue is smart, and the stripped-down performances are seamlessly delivered and punctuated with moments of pure, stark, painful honesty.\"\n\nWeb series\nIn 2016, the companion web series Forgive Me Web Confessions was launched, again starring McLeod as The Priest, with Keelin Jack, Krista MacDonald and Callum Dunphy as penitents. The web series was also well received, with nominations for most of the cast from the ACTRA Awards.\n\nAwards and nominations\n2020 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Karen Robinson\n2020 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Hugh Thompson\n2020 ACTRA Award nomination for Outstanding Female Performance, Karen Robinson\n2019 ACTRA Award for Best Supporting Actor, Jeremy Akerman, for the episode Oh God I Am Heartily Sorry For Having Offended You\n2017 ACTRA Award for Best Leading Actor, Mike McLeod, Forgive Me Web Confessions for the episode Sodomy\n2017 ACTRA Award nomination for Best Leading Actress, Keelin Jack, Forgive Me Web Confessions for the episode Revenge\n2017 ACTRA Award nomination for Best Leading Actress, Krista MacDonald, Forgive Me Web Confessions for the episode Fornication\n2017 Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance in a Guest Role, Dramatic Series Edward Asner\n2016 ACTRA Award for Best Leading Actor, Mike McLeod\n2016 ACTRA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Mary-Colin Chisholm\n2016 ACTRA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Gharrett Patrick Paon\n2015 ACTRA Award for Best Leading Actor, Mike McLeod\n2015 ACTRA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Candy Palmater\n2015 Screen Nova Scotia Award nomination for Best TV Series\n2015 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series, Thom Fitzgerald for the episode Hallowed Be Thy Name\n2015 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role, Mike McLeod\n2015 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Series, Hugh Thompson, for the episode Hallowed Be Thy Name\n2015 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Supporting Role in a Dramatic Program or Series, Jane Alexander, for the episode Forgive Us Our Trespasses\n2015 Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Performance in a Guest Role, Dramatic Series, Brenda Fricker, for the episode Thy Will Be Done\n2014 ACTRA Award for Outstanding Male Performance in a Feature Film, MOW, TV Series or Web Series, John Dunsworth, Forgive Me \n2014 ACTRA Award for Outstanding Female Performance in a Feature Film, MOW, TV Series or Web Series, Jane Alexander, Forgive Me \n2014 ACTRA Award Nomination for Outstanding Female Performance in a Feature Film, MOW, TV Series or Web Series, Lauren Liem, Forgive Me\n2014 ACTRA Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male, Hugh Thompson, Forgive Me\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2013 Canadian television series debuts\n2018 Canadian television series endings\nSuper Channel (Canadian TV channel) original programming\n2010s Canadian drama television series\nTelevision shows set in Nova Scotia\nTelevision shows filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia\nCanadian religious television series\nTelevision series about Christian religious leaders\nReligious drama television series\n2010s Canadian LGBT-related drama television series", "machine_text": " Forgive Me (TV Series) is a British crime drama set in London that aired from August 2011 to June 2012. Written and executive produced by BAFTA Award-winning writer Andrew Davies and based on the book of the same title by Anthony Minghella, the series follows Detective Inspector Mike Bolt (Ray Winstone). Bolt is a hard-bitten detective attached to the Special Crimes Unit. Over six episodes he and his team investigate a number of high-profile and special cases, often working alongside an informant known as \"The Mule\" (Luke Ashton) as they are pulled into a complex web of corruption, blackmail and moral dilemmas. The first episode of the show was originally broadcast on BBC One in August 2011. The series' cast includes a variety of experienced and familiar faces including Dominic West, Bill Nighy, Ruth Wilson, Kelly Macdonald, Robert Glenister and Penelope Wilton. Forgive Me's lead actor Ray Winstone draws particular praise for inhabiting the part of Detective Bolt, bringing a gravitas to the role that was highly complimented by critics. Film series writer Andrew Davies was praised for his work. Davies' grasp of the original source material was praised for providing an imaginative and exciting starting point for the series which he promised would be \u201ca suspenseful and invigorated take on police investigations\u201d. The episodes of the series follow Detective Bolt as he investigates and solves crimes with the help of his team and informant. In his own words Bolt notes that he doesn't trust anyone, pointing to a deep flaw within his characterisation and approach. As the series progresses Bolt slowly peels away the psychological layers inhibiting him from the tragedy of his own past. Forgive Me proves to be an extremely entertaining crime drama, with a narrative that effortlessly skims the surface of a much deeper theme - human nature. The characters provide a fascinating counterpoint to Bolt, each actor adding to the one-off nature of the series. Through this, Forgive Me succeeds in providing viewers with an intriguing \u2014 and sometimes thrilling \u2014 window into the inner workings of a criminal investigation, whilst asking important moral questions themselves. By providing a thought-provoking exploration of morality, justice and the human soul, Forgive Me quickly became a much discussed and highly enjoyable piece of television.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40604484}

After gaining national exposure playing in Lavelle White's backing ensemble, Hooks has released three albums to date, appeared on German television and undertaken various tours, including one in Europe.\n\nLife and career\nHooks was born in Houston, Texas, United States. He found early musical inspiration from the recordings of fellow Texans Albert Collins, Billy Gibbons and Stevie Ray Vaughan. In the late 1980s, Hooks played in the bars of Houston, before being asked to play in Lavelle White's backing band. He played on her national tours in 1996, before forming his own band and going solo the following year. In 1997, Hooks recorded his debut album, Hooked Up, at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. AllMusic noted that Hooked Up contained \"a collection of gritty, rock-tinged electric blues numbers that didn't stray far outside the conventions that his aforementioned guitar heroes had brought into an international spotlight.\"\n\nThe exposure the recording gave Hooks led to a European record executive, Ed van Zyl, offering Hooks a recording contract with the Dutch-based record label Provogue Records.  The resulting self-titled album was made under the tutelage of record producer Ben Elliott. Jay Hooks was recorded by the trio of Hooks (guitars, vocals), Marie Del Prete (bass) and Joe Frenchwood (drums). It was released in late 2000. His Texas rock sound was well received by the critics. At the time Hooks was quoted as saying \"... I just plug it in and turn it all up, that's what I do...\"   In 2001, Hooks toured across Europe.\n\nJerry Gaskill played the drums on Hooks next release, the Red Line album (2002), which was also released by Provogue. Red Line mostly contained songs written by Hooks, apart from his cover of Jimi Hendrix's track, \"Freedom\". In 2003, Hooks played live on the German television show, Rockpalast.\n\nHooks performed at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas early in 2015.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John Greig\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Greig  (born 11 September 1942) is a Scottish former professional footballer, who played as a defender. He spent his entire career with Rangers, as a player, manager and director. Greig was voted \"The Greatest Ever Ranger\" in 1999 by the club's supporters, and has been elected to Rangers' Hall of Fame.\n\nPlaying career\n\nYouth \nGreig played his youth football with United Crossroads Boys Club in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Eric Gardiner, and supported Hearts as a boy. It is unknown if Hearts showed any interest in signing him. Bob McAuley signed Greig for Rangers and despite his initial reluctance Greig did as instructed by his father. However, after viewing a match between Rangers and Hibernian at Easter Road, where he witnessed them beating Hibs 6\u20131, he was convinced the move was right.\n\nClub career \nA determined, forceful player, recognised for his great leadership qualities, Greig made 755 official appearances for Rangers (498 in the domestic league, 72 in the Scottish Cup, a club record 121 in the League Cup and 64 in European tournaments). He scored 120 goals for the club and won three domestic trebles. Greig actually started his career with Rangers as a forward, prior to being moved back to midfield\u2014playing initially alongside another Rangers legend in Jim Baxter\u2014and finally to left back. It was therefore in those initial years that he scored the majority of his goals for the club.\n\nGreig was captain when Rangers won the European Cup Winners Cup in 1972 beating Dynamo Moscow 3\u20132 in Barcelona. Although Greig's was an enormously successful playing career, his captaincy coincided with a period of sustained success for Rangers' city rivals, Celtic, from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s. Greig's fortitude during that period further cemented his reputation as one of Rangers' most celebrated captains.\n\nHe was granted a testimonial match in 1978 against a Scotland XI as part of the national squad's preparations for the 1978 FIFA World Cup; Rangers won 5\u20130 before a crowd of 65,000 at Ibrox.\n\nInternational career \nGreig played for Scotland on 44 occasions, 15 as captain, between 1964 and 1975. He scored the late winner in Scotland's 1\u20130 victory against Italy at Hampden Park on 9 November 1965 and in 1967 achieved the distinction of captaining the Scottish side who beat England 3-2\u2014their first defeat as World Champions\u2014at Wembley. Greig also represented the Scottish League XI 14 times.\n\nManagerial career \nGreig's playing career ended in May 1978 when he was appointed manager of Rangers, replacing Jock Wallace. The club failed to win the league championship during Greig's time as manager, finishing no higher than the second place achieved in 1978\u201379. Greig's team had come close to winning a domestic treble and performed well in Europe in that first season. Rangers reached the quarter-final of the 1978\u201379 European Cup, defeating Italian champions Juventus and becoming the first club to win in European club competition at PSV's Philips Stadion, before eventual elimination to Cologne. There was also the partial compensation of success in domestic cup competitions, with two Scottish Cups and two League Cups secured over the course of Greig's five full seasons as manager. Greig was also responsible for signing Rangers' greatest ever goalscorer Ally McCoist from Sunderland. However, these were isolated achievements, and Greig\u2014under intense pressure from the Scottish media, Rangers supporters and the club's directors\u2014resigned in October 1983, replaced by the returning Wallace.\n\nPost-football career \nAfter leaving Rangers, Greig worked as a pundit for Radio Scotland and BBC television. He returned in 1990 as part of the club's public relations team. Dick Advocaat, manager of Rangers from 1998 to 2001, re-involved Greig in football coaching during which time he contributed to youth development. In 2003, he joined the Rangers board of directors.

Zambrano, a 35-year-old man originally from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, was shot and killed by three police officers after allegedly throwing rocks at cars and police officers. His hands were in the air when the police fired the shots. Police officers said one of the rocks was as large as a softball. A toxicology report conducted by police found Zambrano's blood tested positive for methamphetamine.\n\nZambrano-Montes' family initially filed a $4.8 million claim against the city of Pasco for the shooting, which they called an \"execution\", saying he \"did not represent a threat of grievous bodily harm to anyone\" at the time of his death. Two of the officers involved in the shooting were white, and one was Hispanic. The killing led to criticism by the Mexican government. with the country's President, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, condemning the officers' \"disproportionate use of lethal force.\"\n\nBackground\nZambrano-Montes was raised in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, the third of sixteen children born to Jes\u00fas Montes and Agapita Montes-Rivera. In 2004, he immigrated to the United States to work in the orchards. He was married with two daughters. His wife had previously obtained a protection order against him alleging abuse. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English. He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police stated that he had tried to grab an officer's pistol in the officer's holster as well as throwing objects at the officers and trying to strike them with a mailbox. He pleaded guilty in June 2014. Prior to the incident, he had spent some time in a homeless shelter and was \"struggling emotionally\" after being unable to work after an injury. According to police reports, the officers first tried to subdue him with voice commands and then with a Taser.\n\nShooting\nThree officers\u2014Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz\u2014fired on Zambrano-Montes. Flanagan and Wright are white, and Alaniz is Hispanic. None of them were wearing body cameras. The shooting was caught on video by a civilian who recorded the incident from about 50 feet away showing Zambrano-Montes was running away from police, either with a rock in his hand or unarmed, and turned to face the officers before he was shot by them. Several weeks prior to the shooting, one of the officers, Adam Wright, had dragged Zambrano-Montes away from his burning rental home.\n\nAftermath\nThe death of Zambrano-Montes led to criticism by the Mexican government with Mexico's Congress calling the shooting an \"act that outrages all Mexicans\" and the country's President, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, condemning the officers' \"disproportionate use of lethal force.\" There were also mass protests in Pasco, with many protesters attending from outside the local community. The Tri-City Herald reported that \"turmoil continued in Pasco nearly two weeks after the controversial shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes,\" as protests are not typically of this size in this town. A small ongoing presence of activists was present at the Pasco City Hall.\n\nThe three officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave. As of February 16, \"a multiagency investigation was underway\". A local group, Consejo Latino, called for an additional investigation by the United States Department of Justice.  There are 68 officers on the police force in Pasco, of whom 14 (21%) are Hispanic. Pasco is 56% Hispanic.\n\nOn February 26, a report indicated \"The U.S. Attorney's office for Eastern Washington ... [had joined] the FBI in keeping track of the investigation.\"\n\nAs of February 27, 2015, reports indicated that seventeen shots had been fired; there were conflicting reports regarding as to whether autopsy results indicated the victim had been shot in the back. The medical examiner's analysis was expected to be complete in about a month's time; transcripts of witness statements were not expected to be available for several weeks. Zambrano-Montes's family commissioned a third autopsy conducted by forensic pathologist Werner Spitz. A federal mediator from the US Justice Department was dispatched in late March to help to mediate talks between the Pasco police department and local community groups who believe the shooting was unjustified while Zambrano-Montes' widow has called for the three officers to be charged with murder. A request to Governor Jay Inslee by Latino advocacy group Consejo Latino to remove Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant  from the investigation was refused, on the basis that prosecutors were obligated to fully investigate and prosecute crimes absent \"very specific, tangible, and compelling reasons.\"\n\nShawn Sant\u2014along with Michael C. Ormsby, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington\u2014declined to file charges against the three officers, stating that the officers acted in good faith and without malice. Ryan Flanagan left the police department in July 2015 while on administrative leave. The other two officers, Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz, eventually returned to duty.\n\nCivil lawsuit\nIn 2015, the family of Zambrano filed a $25 million claim in federal court against the city of Pasco claiming excessive force led to his death. The family hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida and the family of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; and Jose Baez, who represented Casey Anthony. The family later accepted a $700,000 settlement which was divided among Zambrano's two daughters, parents and widow.\n\nReferences\n\n2015 in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nLatino people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States\nProtests in the United States\nFilmed killings by law enforcement\nCriminal rock-throwing", "machine_text": " Antonio Zambrano-Montes was a 35-year-old Mexican-American man who was shot and killed by three officers of the Pasco Police Department in Pasco, Washington, United States on February 10, 2015. On the day of his death, Zambrano-Montes was walking in the street and throwing \"rocks the size of softballs\" at various cars and passersby. Three Pasco police officers, Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright, and Adrian Alaniz, responded to a call about a man throwing rocks at cars. Zambrano-Montes had a criminal record, which included a prior conviction for assault. When the officers attempted to arrest Zambrano-Montes, he ran down the street and was pursued by one of the officers, who attempted to subdue him with a taser. When the taser was unsuccessful, the other two officers joined in the pursuit. According to an investigation by the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit, Zambrano-Montes stopped briefly at a stop sign and then turned to face the officers when they caught up with him. At this time, officers Flanagan and Wright fired a total of 17 rounds at Zambrano-Montes, while Officer Alaniz fired one shot. Zambrano-Montes was killed by the shots. His death sparked protests and accusations of police brutality and racism, as Zambrano-Montes was a Hispanic man. After the incident, an internal review by the Pasco Police Department determined that the three officers had followed proper protocol. Additionally, a Franklin County inquest jury found the three officers not guilty in a second round of hearings in April 2016. However, a lawsuit is currently being brought against the City of Pasco by the Zambrano-Montes family. The death of Zambrano-Montes has prompted calls for changes to police training and protocols, particularly regarding the use of deadly force and interactions with people suffering from mental health issues. This case has been cited in the formation of a new unit in the Washington State Patrol which specifically focuses on police shootings and their investigation. The memory of Antonio Zambrano-Montes lives on in Pasco, Washington, where a memorial was dedicated in his honor on the fourth anniversary of his death. The memorial serves as a reminder of the death of a father, son, and friend who did not have to be taken from his family and community.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Singapore Dreaming\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Singapore Dreaming is a 2006 Singaporean drama film. It follows the Loh family, a typical Singaporean working-class family, through their aspirations and dreams for a better and affluent life and the reality that would make it difficult for them to fulfill these aspirations. \n\nThe film is inspired by a 2000 Singaporean essay titled Paved with Good Intentions, that the writers of the film had written for the Singapore International Foundation. A concatenation of e-mails Singaporeans sent to writers Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen on their life stories in relation to the Singaporean dream eventually led them to write, produce and direct Singapore Dreaming. The film stars Richard Low as Poh Huat, Alice Lim as Siew Luan, Serene Chen as Irene, Yeo Yann Yann as Mei, Lim Yu-Beng as CK and Dick Su as Seng.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on 7 September 2006, and at one time ranked fifth on the Singaporean box office. It has been acclaimed as one of the best Singaporean films of the 2000s. It won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the 54th San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, and was the first such Singaporean film to receive an IFFPA-recognised international feature film award. Owing to its nature as a local film, Singapore Dreaming received much attention from Singaporean viewers, film critics and public figures alike, including S. R. Nathan, the then President of Singapore. It has been praised by local critics as a relatable portrayal of working-class life in Singapore.\n\nPlot\nPoh Huat (Richard Low), the father of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's clerk. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a housewife who likes to brew liang teh (herbal tea) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying lottery tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of car models and condominiums and stores them in a box in his room.\n\nThe family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei's superior academic performance, the family has consistently shown favouritism for Seng. Even though he was ostensibly the academically poorer sibling, dropping out of school in Secondary 3, his parents still chose to fund his overseas polytechnic education instead of furthering his sister's education. Seng is due to return after two years at Dubois Polytechnical University (at Idaho). To fund his overseas studies, he had to borrow extra money from his fianc\u00e9e, Irene (Serene Chen), who stays with Seng's parents.\n\nMei works as a secretary who maintains a friendly working relationship with her boss. She is due for delivery in two months' time, and for maternity leave in a month's time. Her husband, Chin Keong (Lim Yu-Beng), quit his job in the Singapore Armed Forces a month before and is now selling insurance, though unsuccessfully. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they frequently go to a condominium showroom to take a look, revealing their aspirations for a more luxurious lifestyle.\n\nSeng returns from the United States. Tensions escalate in the family between Mei and Seng, due to the family's apparent favouritism for Seng. Seng goes for several job interviews, but is unsuccessful. He becomes immensely disappointed, and lies to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects.\n\nPoh Huat strikes the Toto lottery, winning S$2 million, and the family is ecstatic. Seng decides that he wants to try starting a business. He gains his father's approval, who gives him effectively unlimited funding through a credit card. Seng also buys a car, without Irene's knowledge. Irene is infuriated when she learns Seng has been overspending without working first.\n\nInitially thrilled by his sudden elevation to the higher social class, Poh Huat dies suddenly of a heart attack while he was at a country club for a membership interview. Siew Luan goes into shock. At the funeral, Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses. Mei vents her anger on Chin Keong, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor and storming off. Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. Chin Keong expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, \"Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, do we have a choice?\" and returns to work. At work, Mei's boss, frustrated at the incapable temporary secretary, vents his anger at Mei and demands her to photocopy a stack of documents and brew coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task.\n\nBack at the funeral, Mei realizes that S$500 has gone missing from the pek kim, and wrongly accuses her Filipino maid, Pinky, of stealing the money. Chin Keong reveals shortly after that the money is actually with him. Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spits at Mei. Chin Keong goes to a nearby coffee shop for a drink. A beer girl from Mainland China approaches him at his table to talk to him, and Chin Keong ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, \"You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?\". During the funeral wake, Seng reveals to his family that he did not graduate. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.\n\nA few months later, Chin Keong, Seng and Mei, with her newly-born son, are called to a lawyer's office. It is revealed that Poh Huat's will has been found (made before either of them are born): he had left all his assets to his wife Siew Luan. However, the family has chalked up a debt of S$800,000 in sending Seng overseas. Siew Luan is absent from the meeting, so the lawyer announces that, of the remaining S$1, 200,000, Mei is getting S$300,000, while Seng is getting S$1,000. At the movie's end, Siew Luan hands some money over to Poh Huat's mistress and illegitimate son in a show of benevolence, and leaves Seng. Irene decides to go abroad to pursue a degree in photography.\n\nCast\nA team of local actors composed the cast for Singapore Dreaming. Some casting decisions were made when the producers were penning the script in New York while others were made in Singapore.\n\nThe characters of the film were based on the experiences of the people around the writers, that of the writers themselves, and on the e-mail responses that they received to their essay.\n\nRichard Low as Poh Huat: MediaCorp actor Richard Low had a role in one of the MediaCorp productions that was filming during the time Singapore Dreaming was set to film. However, he was not engaged as his character in that production was in coma. In the film, Poh Huat is the patriarch of the Loh family. He persistently favours and sides with his son, Seng over his daughter, Mei. Like the rest of the family, he yearns for a better life and, in particular, for a car and a country club membership.\nAlice Lim as Siew Luan: Alice Lim was one of the actresses that were cast later. She is the first female MC for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the 1970s. The directors admired her 'beautiful' delivery of Hokkien in the film. In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a housewife ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, who, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with the audience as the film concludes.\nSerene Chen as Irene: The producers had a good relationship with Serene Chen from their previous work together on an earlier production, 3Meals. They planned to cast Serene Chen early on, during the initial script-writing. In the film, Serene plays the live-in fianc\u00e9e of Seng, Irene. Irene is deeply attached to Seng and hankers for a marriage with him in the beginning of the film. She, together with Poh Huat, funded his overseas studies. Irene is also very close to Siew Luan.\nYeo Yann Yann as Mei: Although the producers were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used her face as a reference when writing for the character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei. In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when she was the one whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng.\nLim Yu-Beng as CK: The part of CK was written for Lim Yu-Beng, who agreed to join the film's production. In the film, CK resigned as an army officer and turned to selling insurance, a career at which he does not appear to be successful.\nDick Su as Seng: Dick Su was involved in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.\n\nDevelopment\n\nConception\n\nThe development of Singapore Dreaming began in 2000 when New York-based couple Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen wrote an essay for Singaporeans Exposed, a publication to commemorate the Singapore International Foundation's ten-year anniversary. The 5200-word essay, Paved with Good Intentions, explained the difference between the Singapore Dream and the Singapore Plan, and discussed the source and fashion of many Singaporeans' aspirations.  Paved with Good Intentions was later circulated round the Internet, where many Singaporeans read the essay.\n\nConfessional responses the couple received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a podcast with mrbrown, Woo explained the typical reader response was \"How is it that I now have a house, I now have a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?\" The couple \"felt a responsibility to do something\", which inspired them to write the film, the original working title of which was The 5Cs.\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was a number of firsts in the film industry; Singapore Dreaming was the first Singaporean film to be digitally encoded and projected. It was also the first collaboration between Singaporean and New York film-makers; the Director of photography Martina Radwan, editor Rachel Kittner and sound designer Paul Hsu were based in New York, along with the production staff, while composer Sydney Tan was based in Singapore.\n\nSingapore Dreaming was an independent, low-budget production, costing only S$800 000 in total to produce \u2014 80% of which was raised by Executive Producer Woffles Wu. The film was Woffles Wu's first production, and the Colin Goh\u2013Woo Yen Yen team's second. The rigors of production forced Producer Woo Yen Yen to take a no-pay leave from her job as an assistant professor.\n\nFilming began in August 2005, with the scenes in the house shot in an actual 3-room HDB flat in a bid for authenticity. This led to situations in which the cast and crew had to squeeze into the rooms in the small flat for hours on end. The team also had to endure heat and stuffy conditions, especially during the scene in which the family shared steamboat in the living room.\n\nIn an attempt at authenticity and realism, the producers allowed the characters speak in a mix of Hokkien, English and Mandarin, in the typical Singaporean manner. The film would later be subtitled in English and Mandarin during post-production so that the audience would be able to understand the characters' lexicon without knowing how the average Singaporean speaks.\n\nUnlike in larger productions, the team of directors had to assume numerous roles during the independent production, some of which included the transportation of furniture and buying drinking water for the crew during the shoot. Colin Goh and Steven Chin, the assistant director, also had to take the unusual step of staging a fight to distract curious passers-by and prevent them from gathering round when they were shooting a certain scene.  After the filming was complete, the movie was digitally encoded in New York and digitally projected at a number of select cinemas.\n\nPublicity and release\n\nPremieres \nBefore being commercially released, Singapore Dreaming was screened at two charity premieres. The first, on 12 April 2006 at Lido, was a pre-opener to the Singapore International Film Festival. Tickets were sold at $15 and all proceeds went to the Festival. The tickets were sold out by 6.00\u00a0pm on the day they were released. Among the guests were public figures including president Sellapan Ramanathan and wife, Foreign Minister George Yeo and Opposition Member of Parliament Chiam See Tong. Directors like Jack Neo and Eric Khoo also attended this premiere. A total of about 700 people attended the event.\n\nThe second charity premiere was on 30 August 2006, and the beneficiary was the Association of Women for Action and Research. The producers organized a Teachers' Day Giveaway, allowing students to nominate teachers for a free screening. In total, 100 pairs of tickets were given away this way.\n The audience filled up all five cinema halls at GV Grand at Great World City. Like the first premiere, the event was sold-out.\n\nCommercial release \nSneak previews began on 1 September 2006 while the film was commercially released on 7 September 2006. The film opened on a total of eighteen screens islandwide, which encompasses all GV and Cathay screens and selected Shaw and Eng Wah screens.\n\nThe producers were initially concerned about the small independent film lasting in the cinemas with the influx of American blockbusters. Thus, the producers continually urged on the film's blog for those interested to watch the film as early as possible, in case of a short theatrical run. However, the film's theatrical run was to continue for eight weeks; it outlasted all other films that opened in the same week. After a hiatus of a few weeks, the film reopened transiently at GV VivoCity.\n\nIn October 2007, the film was screened at the Freer Gallery of Art of the Smithsonian, Washington, DC, as part of the ASEAN Film Festival.\n\nAdvertising \nThe directors, with their limited funds, put print advertisements in local newspapers to advertise the film. The last print advertisement appeared in local newspapers on 16 September 2006, the tenth day after the release of the film.\n\nDue to the small advertising budget, however, a large part of the film's advertising took place through the Internet. For instance, the film's directors spoke directly to the viewers through their blog to advertise the film through word-of-mouth. In particular, they instructed viewers to tell at least ten friends about the film. The producers also appeared on the 6 September 2006 release of the mrbrown show and, in a 31-minute podcast, shared with the audience the production of the film.\n\nAs further publicity for the film, Colin Goh uploaded three trailers of the film onto YouTube to raise awareness and interest about the movie. By 15 August 2006, the trailers had 7000 views in total, and one of them had 4000 views. The producers also advertised the film through TalkingCock, a satirical website that they own, by posting articles and updates on the film's development.\n\nReception\n\nAwards\nSingapore Dreaming competed for two awards in the Zalbaltegi section of the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, the first being the Moutblanc New Screenwriter's Award (the third ever awarded in the annual festival), and the second being the Altadis-New Directors Award. This film lost the latter award to Fair Play, but bagged the Moutblanc New Screenwriter's Award. There were eighteen films in competition for the screenwriter's award. The directors did not submit the films directly to San Sebastian at first. Instead, they sent preview screeners to solicit comments on the film from their friends in New York. The film was spread around resulting in it being nominated for the film festival.\n\nThe feature film is the first Singaporean film to be in competition for the two awards at the IFFPA-recognized San Sebastian International Film Festival. Moreover, while other Singaporean films (like those directed by Eric Khoo and Royston Tan) have won awards at other international film festivals before, those are either not recognized by IFFPA, or are categorized by them as \"specialized\". The \"specialized\" tag means that, as The Straits Times explains, \"they focus on a particular aspect of film or film-making\". The film thus has the added honour of being the first Singaporean film to receive an award at an IFFPA-recognised international feature film festival.\n\nOn 28 October 2007, Singapore Dreaming snagged the Best Asian/Middle-Eastern Film Award at the 20th Tokyo International Film Festival, and is the first Singapore feature to win this award.\n\nBox office and rankings\nAs of 2 October 2006, three-and-a-half weeks after its local commercial release, Singapore Dreaming grossed S$420 000 from the local box office. The producers claim the film to be the highest grossing Singapore film produced in the past eight years not produced by MediaCorp or MediaCorp Raintree Pictures. The film was the fifth at the local box office for the week the film opened. In its second week, the film dropped to the sixth position, and in its third week, to the eighth position. From the fourth week onwards to the end of the film's theatrical run, it ceased to appear in Singapore's top ten charts.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised its technical aspects and relatability, but had reservations regarding its originality. Neil Humphreys, in a Today feature of Singapore Dreaming, pointed out that it is untainted by crass sexual themes, unlike 12 Storeys, which featured similar characters. Humphreys wrote, \"the characters are immediately identifiable, particularly the women. And depicting such social reality on screen underscores Goh and Woo's bravery.\" Lin Wenqi, reviewing the film for a Taiwan Film Institute periodical, also found the film to be a captivating and relatable portrayal of Singapore society. According to Lin, unlike the excessively preachy Singaporean film I Not Stupid, Singapore Dreaming was impressive in its ability to weave life lessons into the plot and cinematography. Singaporean critic Vinita Ramani praised the acting, and agreed that many Singaporeans found the film relatable. However, Ramani wrote that the film \"falls short of expectations\" because it featured platitudes regarding the unsuccessful pursuit of material wealth by unfulfilled HDB heartlanders, a theme already \"milked to death\" in Singaporean films such as 12 Storeys (1997). The Spanish critic Jonathan Holland, writing for Variety, called the first half of the film \"over-stretched, noisy comedy\", preferring the portrayal of the funeral proceedings in the second half for its \"pleasing lightness of touch\" and lyrical music.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe Singapore Dreaming soundtrack was released by BooBao Records in June 2006. It comprises various songs and tunes that were featured in the movie, most of which were composed by the music director for the film, Sydney Tan. Stephen Hough is also listed as one of the soundtrack's composers. The soundtrack album, containing both emotive and entertaining pieces, shows a variation in the mood of the songs.\n\nOf particular prominence in the soundtrack is the 1933 Taiwanese song B\u0101ng Chhun-hong. Lin Wenqi points out that the song's last phrase, \"I was fooled, for it was just the wind\", paralleled the characters Poh Huat and Seng's fruitless pursuit of material wealth. As the producers were writing the script in New York, Woo Yen Yen called her mother in Singapore to ask her about the most popular song of her time. Her mother's first suggestion was B\u0101ng Chhun-hong, a song which the producers came to like. The song was later adopted as the opening theme, and the character Siew Luan would hum it again as the film concludes, this time more wistfully as she would recount the days when she was young. Four major and three minor variations of the song were included in the soundtrack. As Moviexclusive describes Sydney Tan's score, \"the [\u2026] use of pianos and strings is complemented by the occasional wistful accompaniments of the traditional erhu, adding the essential 'Asian touch' to the music.\" According to Woo, during auditions for the film, several young actors teared upon hearing the song, which reminded them of their youth and parents.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also includes two songs by the local band Ronin, \"Black Maria\" and \"Memories\". It also includes \"Mei Man Ren Sheng\", a song that shares its title with the film. The tune was rearranged by Sydney Tan and performed by Nicole Lai, with lyrics in Chinese by Ng King Kang. The film's producer, Woffles Wu, did the backing vocals for the recording.\n\nReferences and footnotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \nOfficial Singapore Dreaming site\nSingapore Dreaming blog\nSingapore Dreaming at the Internet Movie Database\nBlog of producers Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen\n\nSingaporean films\n2006 films\nEnglish-language films\nMandarin-language films\nHokkien-language films\n2006 drama films", "machine_text": " Singapore Dreaming is a 2006 documentary film directed by Woo Yen Yen and Christine Molloy. The film documents the lives of ordinary Singaporeans in their everyday lives, showing how they strive to realise the dream of success in their society. It also follows a selection of individuals in their quest to achieve happiness and stability in a rapidly changing society. The film takes a look at the struggles of three generations of Singaporeans,uncovering the ever-changing dynamics between them as they grapple with the day-to-day realities of their lives from a range of perspectives. Singapore Dreaming is an observational film, looking at an exciting time in the history of the nation and exploring a variety of issues such as immigration, housing and the socioeconomic disparity of Singapore. The film explores the aspirations of an average Singaporean to fit in and break free from the traditional divisions between people. This is shown through stories of various individuals, from transnational couples, to a transgender girl seeking acceptance, to a family trying to balance work and pleasure. It effectively captures the essence of the Singapore dream and the many responsibilities that must be shouldered in order to make it reality. The film contains interviews with Singaporeans from all walks of life. Each of them offers a unique perspective on the Singapore dream, whether it be the drive to achieve success, determination to overcome the odds, or the struggle to find acceptance in a rapidly changing society. The film paints an honest portrait of a nation that has gone through remarkable changes within a single generation. Despite the relatively recent rise in the standards of living and the expansion of opportunities, Singapore is still, as the film shows, a society with all its inherent complexities. This is true, however, not just of Singapore but of countries around the world. Singapore Dreaming is a challenging and inspirational story of individuals striving to come to terms with a society that is constantly in flux.

Managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, it covers parts of Milton, Quincy, Braintree, Canton, Randolph, and Dedham. Located approximately ten miles south of downtown Boston, the reservation is one of the largest parcels of undeveloped conservation land within the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The park's varied terrain and scenic views make it a popular destination for hikers from the Boston area.\n\nHistory\nEuropean colonizers sailing the coastline noticed the bluish hue of the mountains, which is caused by the presence of riebeckite, which gave area its modern name. The name of the state of Massachusetts derives from the Massachusett Indian tribe's name of the hill: massa-adchu-es-et. In 1893, the Metropolitan Parks Commission purchased the lands of Blue Hills Reservation as one of the state's first areas dedicated to public recreation.\n\nThe practice of First Day Hikes to mark New Year's Day with an outdoor activity began in 1992 at Blue Hills Reservation.  By the 2010s, the idea had spread and such hikes were taking place in state parks nationwide.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe ecology of the Blue Hills is diverse and includes marshes, swamps, upland and bottomland forests, meadows, and an Atlantic white cedar bog.  A number of endangered species in Massachusetts, such as the timber rattlesnake and copperhead snake, reside in the reservation. Other flora and fauna include dogwood, lady's slipper, white-tailed deer, coyotes, wild turkey, red fox, and turkey vultures.\n\nClimate \nThe reservation experiences a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb), typical of most of New England. Summers are short but very warm with mild nights. Winters are short, very snowy, and very cloudy. Precipitation is heavy and very consistent year round.\n\nPoints of interest\n\nObservatory\nThe highest point within the reservation, Great Blue Hill in Milton, is the site of the historic Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory. The observatory was founded in 1885 and is the oldest continuous weather recording station in the United States. Its tower offers views of Boston and the surrounding area. The tower and observatory are among numerous reservation features listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFeatures listed on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nBlue Hills Trailside Museum\n\nThe Blue Hills Trailside Museum, which is operated by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, offers indoor and outdoor animal exhibits.\n\nActivities and amenities\n\nBlue Hills Reservation is primarily used for hiking and mountain biking. It is also used for snowshoeing, downhill skiing, and cross country skiing during winter, and rock climbing (in certain areas) and horseback riding during permissible months. Between approximately December and March, Great Blue Hill offers a ski area. Houghton's Pond and nearby Ponkapoag Pond are popular swimming and recreation areas during the summer. Other recreational opportunities include non-motorized boating, camping, fishing, picnicking, playing fields, ice skating, interpretive programs, and a children's playground is accessible from the Hillside St entrance to Houghtons pond.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBlue Hills Reservation Department of Conservation and Recreation\nBrochure and trail map\nFriends of the Blue Hills\nBlue Hill Observatory HazeCam Current panoramic photo from observatory\nOnline (mobile compatible) trail map\n\nHills of Massachusetts\nLandforms of Norfolk County, Massachusetts\nMassachusetts Audubon Society\nMassachusetts natural resources\nMuseums in Norfolk County, Massachusetts\nNature centers in Massachusetts\nNatural history museums in Massachusetts\nGeography of Braintree, Massachusetts\nParks in Norfolk County, Massachusetts\nReligious places of the indigenous peoples of North America\nProtected areas established in 1893\nState parks of Massachusetts\n1893 establishments in Massachusetts", "machine_text": " Blue Hills Reservation is a largest state park located in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. It was established in 1893 and stretches from Quincy to Dedham and Milton. The reservation is located mostly within the borders of Milford and Canton, although portions of it extend into seven other cities and towns in the Greater Boston area. Blue Hills Reservation covers more than 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) of forests, wetlands, rivers, lakes, bogs and hills. The highest point within the park's boundaries is Great Blue Hill, rising 635 feet (194 meters) from the sea level. This hill, with its five subsidiary peaks, is the most prominent feature of the northeastern landscape, visible for miles around and is part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. In addition to offering a view of the greater Boston area, the reservation offers many recreational opportunities such as hiking, biking, fishing, boating, camping, cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, rock-climbing, nature walks, and more. Owing to its proximity to the sea, mountain, and wetlands, the diversity of its flora and fauna is astounding. The local Native American Mi'kmaqs refer to the reservation as \"Mattakeesett,\" which means \"place of hills.\" Over the years, the reservation has become an important refuge for many species of plants and animals. Hundreds of migratory birds, including hawks and eagles, use the reservation as part of their annual migratory route. Local mammals such as beavers, otters, and deer can often be seen in the reservation's forested areas. The Blue Hills Reservation is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) of Massachusetts. It is regularly patrolled by park rangers, the Massachusetts State Police and the Environmental Police. The DCR plans and implements programs to protect endangered species, preserve ecological integrity, and provide for public access and recreational use. Rangers and staff organize events such as Family Adventure Days, storywalks, nature hikes, and other activities for families and school groups. Blue Hills Observatory and Skyline Trail are two of the most popular attractions within the reservation. The station, located atop Great Blue Hill, measures air temperature, wind direction and speed, cloud and sky cover, relative humidity, pressure, and solar radiation. The Skyline Trail is a ten-mile hiking trail that stretches throughout the entire reservation and offers amazing views of the Boston skyline. Blue Hills Reservation is one of the most beautiful and beloved natural spaces in Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area.

The M6.3 earthquake is the strongest recorded to have hit the country since 1969. The earthquake was felt throughout northern Thailand, as well as parts of Laos, northern Myanmar, and southeastern China. The government of Thailand stated that the maximum intensity reached in Mae Lao district was VII on the Mercalli intensity scale. More than forty people were reported injured in the region, with local sources claiming up to seventy injuries in total. Several buildings were damaged in the district, including some schools and temples. Immediately after the quake, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra sent officials to Uttaradit Province to assess the damage and oversee relief efforts. Monetary aid was sent to help mitigate further potential damage to buildings, and Yingluck also sent doctors and other medical staff to support the injured. Shortly afterwards, a committee was formed to examine the long-term damage caused by the earthquake and create a recovery plan. At the time, seismologists from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) claimed that the low magnitude of the earthquake likely meant minimal risk of a tsunami. Nevertheless, a tsunami alert was issued for the Andaman Sea, and people in the districts of Tak and Phang Nga, both of which are coastal provinces, were evacuated as a precaution. The USGS reported that aftershocks from the Mae Lao earthquake occurred on May 9 and 10, largely ranging from M3 to M4.5 in magnitude.

Originally, it included most of Southern California, generally south and east of Los Angeles, extending to the Arizona and Nevada state lines to the east, and south as far as the Mexican border (what is now area codes 442/760, 619, 858, 909, and 951). Despite Southern California's explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century, this configuration remained in place for 31 years.\n\nFinally, on January 1, 1982, most of the southern and eastern portion, centered around San Diego and the desert areas, became area code 619. In 1992, eastern Los Angeles and the Inland Empire became area code 909. On April 18, 1998, the southern cities of Orange County were split from 714, creating area code 949. \n\nBy 2007, 714 was running out of numbers due to Southern California's continued growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers.

On November 5, 2000, the newly established area code 657 was overlayed onto the same geographic area as area code 714. This region had traditionally been served by just one area code, which was 714. By overlaying code 657, the North American Numbering Plan allowed the area to have enough phone numbers for fulfulling the increasing demand of population. Area code 714 is one of the original area codes created in 1947, originally serving the southern portion of California until 1995, when the area code 909 was introduced to serve much of the Greater Los Angeles area. In 1999, the area code 951 was added to the same geographic area as 714, which was then officially split from it. Area code 657, however, was created from a previously unassigned code in 2000 as part of a province-wide overlay of Southern California. It serves the same geographic area as area code 714, but was created on the same day its \u201csister area code\u201d 951 was split from 714. Major cities in area code 714 include Anaheim, Buena Park, Garden Grove, Irvine, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Orange, Santa Ana, and Tustin, while the major cities that shared 657 coverage included Anaheim, Corona, Irvine, Fullerton, Pasadena, and Riverside. Area codes 714 and 657 are both non-geographic area codes, meaning that they have been designated for special service, such as pagers, cellular phones and toll-free numbers. However, both are still being used for landlines in the area. In addition, numbers with these area codes may be portable and can often be used to receive calls from different parts of the country, depending on the service provider. In order to call from area code 714 to the 657 code, 11-digit dialing would be necessary, wherein the subscriber would need to dial 1 plus the area code before the seven-digit number. The same goes for when dialing from 657 to 714. As of now, both 714 and 657 are not anticipating any further split of changes. In summation, area codes 714 and 657 are two area codes in the North American Numbering Plan that serve Southern California. Prior to the 2000 introduction of 657, the area was served by one area code, 714. These area codes are non-geographic and are used to serve pagers, cellular phones and toll-free numbers.

In later centuries, it was transformed into a residential building. In 1588, the building was sold to the church, and it was used as an inn. It was then transformed into a chapel. During World War II, the building was used as a refuge for people fleeing from the Nazis. After the war, it was returned to the church and used as a parish hall until the 1980s.

The county name was also spelled Arapaho County, Arapahoe County, Arrapahoe County, and Arappahoe County.  The county seat was Denver City.\n\nHistory\nIn July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory.  This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.  Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859.  On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties:  Arapahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County.  The legislation that created Arapahoe County declared:\n\nThat the territory comprised within the following limits, be erected into a county to be called Arappahoe county: commencing at a point where the 40th parallel of north latitude crosses the 104th meridian of west longitude; thence west on said parallel to the centre of the main channel of the south fork of the Platte River, thence upon the main channel of said stream to the mouth of Clear Creek; thence up the main channel of Clear Creek to the mouth of Ralston's Creek; thence in a straight line to a point where Montana Creek joins the main channel of the Platte; thence up the main channel of said stream to the mouth of the canon at the base of the mountains, thence on the main divide between the waters of the Arkansas and the Platte River, to where the 104th meridian of longitude crosses the same, thence north on said meridian to the place of beginning.\n\nArapahoe County was named for the Arapaho Nation of Native Americans that lived in the region.  Denver City served as the county seat of Arapahoe County and was the territorial capital until November 12, 1860.\n\nThe Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado.  On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Arapahoe County, for the new Colorado Territory.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Crips is an alliance of street gangs which is based in the coastal regions of southern California. It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely-connected network of individual \"sets\", often engaged in open warfare with one another. Traditionally, since around 1973, its members have worn blue clothing.\n\nThe Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, the members have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. They have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.\n\nEtymology\n\nSome sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, \"Cribs\", was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into \"Crips\" when gang members began carrying around canes to display their \"pimp\" status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or \"Crips\" for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests \"Crips\" may have evolved from \"Cripplers\", a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for \"Common Revolution In Progress\", a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented \"Community Revolutionary Interparty Service\" or \"Community Reform Interparty Service\".\n\nHistory \n\nGang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including: post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty; racial segregation of young African American men, who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, leading to the formation of black \"street clubs\"; and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.\n\nStanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams however appears to discount the sometimes-cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption. \n\nIn his memoir, Williams also refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it \"depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs\u2014nothing more, nothing less.\" Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.\n\nWilliams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levis, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973. The color then became associated with Crips.\n\nBy 1978, there were 45 Crip gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Neighborhood Crips or the Gangster Crips, waging large-scale war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips (from East Los Angeles) and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and influence increased significantly in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets and Crip sets began distributing the drug. Large profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crips membership grew steadily and the street gang was one of the nation's largest by the late 1980s. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crip sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.\n\nMembership\nAs of 2015, the Crips gang consists of between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 members and 800 sets, active in 221 cities and 41 U.S. states. The states with the highest estimated number of Crip sets are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, but can be white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Crip sets are not exclusive to the United States, having a presence in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California.\n\nCrips have served in the United States armed forces and on military bases in the United States and abroad.\n\nPractices\n\nLanguage\nSome practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter \"b\" in the word \"blood\" is \"disrespected\" among certain Crip sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters \"CK\", which are interpreted to stand for \"Crip killer\", are avoided and replaced by \"cc\". For example, the words \"kick back\" are written \"kicc bacc\", and block is written as \"blocc\". Many other words and letters are also altered due to symbolic associations. Crips traditionally refer to each other as \"Cuz\" or \"Cuzz\", which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for a Crip. \"Crab\" is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.\n\nInitiation (\"Jumping in\")\n\nAlthough getting \"jumped into the gang\" is often commonly thought of as a typical initiation ritual performed on newcomers, some former Crip members such as rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, who joined the 24 Street Crips in Sacramento, California during the 1980s has pointed out that the tradition of getting jumped (beaten) into the gang was \"more of a 1970s (era) practice\" rather than a modern or continuing one.\n\nCriminal rackets and street-activities\n\nAs with most criminal street gangs they have traditionally benefited monetarily from a select set of illicit activities such as illegal gambling, drug-dealing, prostitution, burglary, theft and extortion. Along with profitable rackets such as these, they have also been known to participate in vandalism and property crime, often for gang-pride reasons or just enjoyment. This can include public graffiti (tagging) and \"joyriding\" in stolen vehicles.\n\nTheir current primary illicit source of income is presumably in street-level drug distribution, however many Crip members may also make notable amounts of illegal funds from the black market sale of illicit firearms. Historically, the gang\u2019s size and power was largely augmented by the profits from the street sale of crack cocaine throughout the 1980s showing that PCP, amphetamines and other drugs were not as lucrative for them and thus didn\u2019t have as direct of an effect on the group\u2019s increase in influence.  Therefore the gang\u2019s initial phase of growth and popularity can, in some way, be directly traced back to the explosion crack cocaine in the United States during the 1980s.\n\nCrip-on-Crip rivalries \n\nThe Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles.\n\nBy 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods, a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips.\n\nSince then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crip sets. It is a common misconception that Crip sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other\u2014for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals.\n\nAlliances and rivalries\n\nRivalry with Bloods \nThe Bloods are the Crips' main stereotypical rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and, as of 2010, are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles.\n\nAlliance with Folk Nation \nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as \"8-ball\". A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or \"beef\" between Folks and Crips.\n\nSee also \nAfrican-American organized crime\nCrip Walk\nCrime in Los Angeles\nGangs in Los Angeles\nCrips and Bloods: Made in America\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nGeneral \n\n Leon Bing (1991).

They are one of the largest and most notorious gangs in the United States and are known for their involvement in drug distribution, drive-by shootings, and street-level violence. The gang\u2019s signature colors are blue and gray, and its members are known to carry signs with \"CK\" or the full gang name written on them. The Crips\u2019 main rivals are the Bloods, another Los Angeles-based gang. The gang was initially established in 1969, taking its name from \u2018Cribs\u2019, a term used for African-American youth that came from the south in search of work. According to some reports, the founders of the Crips were high school students that wanted to create an organized group to protect themselves from other gangs. In the beginning, the Crips\u2019 activities consisted of petty neighborhood crime such as vandalism and extortion. As the group grew larger, they began to make increasing profits from drug sales, drive-by shootings, robberies, and other criminal activities. By the 1980s, the Crips had established themselves as one of the most powerful gangs in America. Members of the gang have been implicated in numerous murders, shootings, and other violent acts throughout the United States. Crips-related violence has been reported in over 35 states, including California, Florida, Texas, and New York. The Crips\u2019 trademark sign is \u2018CK\u2019 or the gang\u2019s full name written on clothing and jewelry. Members of the gang are also known for wearing blue and gray bandanas and blue and gray belts with a large \u2018C\u2019 on them. The gang has a habit of tagging graffiti to mark their territory; this has become a visual clue for law enforcement officers, who use it to identify a gang's location. In recent years, the Crips have been losing ground in its fight against rival gang, the Bloods. Law enforcement and community groups have made concerted efforts to combat gang violence, and have worked together to help members of the Crips turn away from a life of crime. These efforts have yielded positive results; the gang has now become less active and less visible in certain areas. In addition, some members of the Crips have begun to engage in dialogues with law enforcement officers, despite the hostile relationship between the two sides. Despite the decreased activity of the Crips, Los Angeles remains one of the most gang-ridden cities in the nation. The Crips have had a long-lasting and lasting effect in Los Angeles and other cities, with both positive and negative influences. Although the original founders of the gang had good intentions, the violence and destruction associated with the Crips and their activities is undeniable.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"School uniforms in South Korea\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Almost all South Korean secondary students wear a prescribed school uniform, gyobok (). The majority of elementary schools except some private elementary schools do not have uniforms; however, the uniform is strictly enforced from the start of middle school and up. A typical South Korean uniform usually consists of a shirt, blazer and tie, with skirts for girls and trousers for boys. More recently, the uniform is often worn by celebrities who target the younger, teen audience to sell entertainment products. The school uniform and school setting is frequently used as a venue for romance. As a result, the uniform has become something akin to an expression of fashion among students.\n\nHistory\nThe Encyclopedia of Korean Culture divides the history of school uniforms into six parts: the 1800s-1910, 1910\u20131945, 1945\u20131968, 1968\u20131982, 1982\u20131985, 1986-current. While the first instances of school uniforms were shown in schools established in the late Goryeo period, a general influence is attributed to Confucius students from the Joseon period.\n\nLate 19th and early 20th century\n\nThe first school uniform in South Korea is from the Ewha Girl's University, now known as Ewha Womans University. The uniform was designated in 1886. The uniform consisted of a red jeogori and skirt made of cotton. The hair was braided swept-back with a knot. Clothing designed as a veil was used as an outdoor uniform. A heavier version of the clothing was used during the winter. Since the tradition was to wear different colored uniforms, the same red-colored uniform became a matter of curiosity.\n\nThe first boys' school uniform in South Korea originates from the boys' school Paichai Hakdang established by Henry Appenzeller. The uniform was created in 1898. The uniform heavily resembled the Japanese school uniform, consisting of red color bands wrapped around the sleeves, pants, and hat. Some scholars argue that the tradition of Korean school uniforms began with this uniform. Hansung Middle School, which was established in 1904, used a black durumagi with a black belt and a hat with the words 'Hansung' for a uniform.\n\nIn 1907, the first 'Yangjang' uniform was created in the Sookmyung Women's University. The uniform consisted of a purple serge one-piece clothing with a pink bonnet and heels. The uniform had a strong impact on Korean culture.\n\n20th century\n\nAfter the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, the school uniforms were widely implemented. This movement was heavily influenced by Western missionaries and was centered around girls-only schools. In general, Jeogori was elongated while the skirt was shortened. The previously diverse colors in school uniforms became less and less diverse, with most uniforms becoming shades of black and white.  In the 1920s, most of the girl uniforms came to have the 'white top black bottom' policy. However, schools differentiated their uniforms from others by means such as wave patterns and skirt lengths. Because the skirts were getting shorter, schools implemented an official policy concerning the length of the skirt. However, the skirt lengths kept decreasing. Also in the 1920s, P.E. uniforms were introduced. There were many types of P.E. uniforms, but it mostly consisted of a shirt and bloomers.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Empire of Japan, which ruled over Korea, implemented a policy to unify the girls' uniforms as 'yangjang.' The change in policy is attributed to both a growing awareness of Western culture and a movement by Japan to get rid of hanbok. The most widespread school uniform for girls was a white blouse with a brown skirt, and a sailor suit uniform in the winter. However, a few schools still maintained the hanbok uniform.\n\nIn the late 1930s to the 1940s, students were forced to wear workwear. This was due to the beginning of World War II and Japan's involvement in the war. The uniform was dubbed 'Mum-Bae (\ubab8\ube7c).' Some schools avoided this policy by designating other pants as uniforms. Other schools such as ChungShim Women's School refused to comply with the policy and wore hanbok.\n\nWith the completion of the Korean independence movement and the independence of Korea, the workwear uniform was discarded. Until the 1960s, uniform pants were still worn as the official uniform. The uniforms were generally black or dark brown.\n\nIn 1968, the government established the 'Middle School Equalization Policy.' The Middle School uniforms were standardized at this time. The summer uniform was established as a white 'Wing-collar' blouse and the winter uniform as black or dark brown clothing. This policy was maintained until 1982.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, school uniforms were briefly abolished due to a 'free school uniform policy.' The policy was established to diminish the senses of oppression and alienation while encouraging individualism. This policy was removed in 1986 when schools were allowed to mandate uniforms again. Since then, the number of schools mandating uniforms had been increasing.\n\nCurrent\n\nSchools are currently not compelled to institute school uniforms. However, according to the Ministry of Education (South Korea), 96.4% of female students are wearing uniforms. To combat temperature, sexual harassment, and traditional sexual discrimination, the Ministry of Education (South Korea) has been encouraging the usage of pants as school uniforms, as of 2000.\n\nComponents\nA typical Korean school uniform for a boy usually includes a jacket, a long-sleeved collared white shirt, a tie, dress trousers, and outerwear for the Winter season. A girl's Korean school uniform generally consists of a bow, a collared white shirt with sleeves, a vest, a pleated skirt and outerwear for the winter, and white socks. Nail polish and make-up were generally not allowed until many municipal education departments enacted 'Student's rights acts' which include freedom of uniform and freedom of hair style.\n\nSee also\n\nSchool uniforms\nSouth Korea\n\nReferences\n\nEducation in South Korea\nSchool uniform", "machine_text": " School uniforms in South Korea refers to the standardized dress code that is enforced by the Korean Ministry of Education for the purpose of maintaining social order and discipline in the nation's public and private educational system. School uniforms are mandated from elementary school to high school, and although private schools have a certain level of autonomy to deviate from necessary requirements, they must still maintain regulations outlined by the Ministry of Education. Despite being a commonly accepted requirement, there are debates regarding the actual purpose and effectiveness of school uniforms in South Korea. Proponents of school uniforms assert that it acts as a form of collaboration between school and family; it reflects the mentalitity of the Korean government to follow rules and regulations; it eliminates competition among students by creating a homogeneous look; and it prevents students from distracting each other by dressing inappropriately. Opponents of school uniforms maintain that it inhibits students\u2019 freedom of expression; it increases financial burden on parents; and it does not promote creativity or individual style. The debate aside, the style of school uniforms in South Korea has changed over time. Today, the typical Korean school uniform for elementary, middle, and high schools is made up of a top, bottom, a blazer, and a school shield badge. For male students a white shirt and black pants are required, and female students are required to wear a white blouse and black skirt. Additionally, there is a full range of optional accessories such as neckties, white gloves, and lanyards. It was only recently that neckties and lanyards for female students became mandatory. In addition to the clothing, students are also provided with school hats. For males, the standard hat design is the same throughout the country, while some variations exist between female students in different parts of the country. The design also often varies between elementary, middle, and high school. It is also common for backpacks and musical instruments to be color coded with the students' school colors or in the case of musical instruments with the student's school emblem.

It consisted of the forces of five states: the Great Qing Dynasty, the Kingdom of Ryukyu, the Kingdom of Siam, the Kingdom of Annam and the Korean Joseon Dynasty. The force was in response to a rapidly expanding imperial Japan which, during the mid-19th century, had acquired a considerable amount of territory in East Asia, as well as a considerable naval presence on the seas of East Asia. The Armies of Death were formed as a unified defense against Japanese aggression, primarily in the form of attacks on any of the five member states. The Armies of Death were composed mainly of infantry, cavalry and some artillery, with the Qing Dynasty typically contributing the bulk of the forces. The Kingdom of Siam and the Kingdom of Annam provided naval forces, particularly to defend the Ryukyu Islands and the coast of China. The forces' ability to repel Japanese forces varied, largely dependent on the strength and morale of the forces themselves as well as the skill of their commanders. In 1876, the Armies of Death scored its only major success against the Japanese, at the Battle of Chi-Bi, where they defeated the Japanese forces led by General Satsuma Gi-In. This marked an unexpected reversal of fortunes and was seen as a major victory for the Armies of Death. However, it would not be long before the superior capabilities of the Japanese forces began to take their toll. In the following years, the five armies suffered a string of defeats, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Armies of Death in 1887. The alliance effectively ended with the total absence of a unified command and, crucially, the failure of any nation to take responsibility for the defense of the alliance. This consequently led to a weakening of the alliance, coupled with the material and strategic superiority of the Japanese forces. Ultimately, the Armies of Death failed in their goal: to prevent Japanese expansion in East Asia.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Prosopometamorphopsia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Prosopometamorphopsia is a visual disorder characterized by altered perceptions of faces. Facial features are distorted in a variety of ways including drooping, swelling, discoloration, and shifts of position. Prosopometamorphopsia is distinct from prosopagnosia which is characterised by the inability to recognise faces. About 75 cases of prosopometamorphopsia have been reported in the scientific literature. In about half of the reported cases, features on both sides of the face appear distorted. In the other half of cases, distortions are restricted to one side of the face (left or right) and this condition is called hemi-prosopometamorphopsia.\n\nPresentation \nGenerally, faces tend to appear distorted to a person who is affected by this condition. Those who suffer from this condition are able to recognise faces normally but perceive them as strangely disfigured. These facial hallucinations are usually described as ugly, and have prominent eyes and teeth. Some have described the faces as having a cartoon-like quality. Faces have been known to be perceived as contorted and as having displaced features. For example, one patient described a person's face as having a nose deviated to the side, the mouth laying at a diagonal and one eyebrow being higher than the other. Prosopometamorphopsia may either involve perceptions of the whole face or only one side of the face (usually after right hemisphere damage).\n\nCauses \nThe definitive cause for prosopometamorphopsia is still relatively unknown. However, several potential theories have been expressed in the literature in this area. Generally, this condition has been associated with damage or abnormalities in various brain areas (temporal, occipital, parietal, and frontal lobes). The development of prosopometamorphopsia has been recorded to be a manifestation of epilepsy in some cases. Hyperactivity in the core or distributed face areas (without lesions) may be connected to causation.\n\nFunctional imaging studies in humans have identified an area in the fusiform gyrus which is selectively activated by stimulation when exposed to faces called the fusiform face area (FFA). Another area known to be activated by face stimuli is the superior temporal sulcus (STS). This region is particularly active when having to process facial expressions, especially the expressive features related to the eyes. Therefore, it has been suggested that the prominent eyes (which is a typical feature in the facial perceptions) in the distortions recorded is more in accordance with increased activity (which would cause an over-representation of the eyes) within the STS rather than the fusiform face area.\n\nOther studies, however, have found that stimulation of the posterior and mid-fusiform face selective regions in a patient with medication-resistant epilepsy resulted in perceptions consistent with that of facial metamorphoses (patient noted that the experimenter's face started to droop). This study found that the perceived distortions correlated with signal changes in the patient's FFA and not in the STS.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nClassification \nProsopometamorphopsia is considered a face hallucination and is included under the umbrella of complex visual hallucinations. Unlike other forms of hallucinations such as peduncular hallucinosis or Charles Bonnet syndrome, prosopometamorphopsia does not predominate at a particular time of day; it is a constant experience. However, patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome have noted descriptions of prosopometamorphopsia. This form of perceptual distortion along with others such as macropsia and micropsia (alteration of perceived object size) and palinopia (spatial and temporal varieties and polyopia) are classified under the category termed metamorphopsia. These facial distortions can occur to either hallucinated perceptions or true (non-hallucinated) perceptions. It is attributed to structural brain changes or functional disorders like epilepsy, migraine or eye diseases.\n\nTreatment \nAntidepressants such as citalopram and the antipsychotic quetiapine have been recorded as unable to facilitate improvements for these symptoms. Valproic acid was initially used to treat the woman who hallucinated the dragon-like faces and this alleviated her symptoms entirely, however, she went on to develop auditory hallucinations as a side effect. She was subsequently prescribed rivastigmine instead which reduced the auditory hallucinations and reduced her visual symptoms.\n\nThe 75-year-old woman in the previous study was treated with intravenous heparin infusion and coumadization over a period of 10 days which enabled the alleviation of her visual symptoms almost entirely. The type of treatment may vary depending on the cause of the facial distortions.\n\nCase studies \nOne study reported a 24-year-old woman who developed prosopometamorphopsia after a childbirth. Initially she developed severe migraines and blurred vision mainly in her right visual hemifield and was in a confused state. The visual disturbances persisted long after the migraine had subsided several hours later. She described the left half of people's faces as \"out of place\" and would see these distortions irrespective of whether the faces were familiar or unknown. However, she was able to visualise the faces of familiar people in her mind without the distortions. She also did not report perceiving distortions in stimuli other than faces and demonstrated the same patterns a year after the first assessments. It was discovered that this woman had a left hemisphere lesion which resulted in distortions of the left half of the faces to which she was exposed. The unilateral aspect of the defect suggests that the early stages of face processing occurs in parallel mechanisms across both hemispheres and the right hemisphere then integrates the information that results in a unitary face representation.\n\nAnother study examined a 75-year-old woman who suffered from a sudden onset of nausea, dizziness and blurred vision. The central part of faces, especially the nose and mouth, were described as being out of shape. She claimed that noses looked narrow and lengthened toward the mouth which looked small and rounded regardless of whether the faces were familiar to her or not. She was found not to have any other impairments in her visuoperceptual performances, nor did she have any cognitive or psychiatric impairments. A T2-weighted brain MRI revealed an infarction in the right medial temporooccipital lobe including the parahippocampal gyrus (complement of the FFA).\n\nA 52-year-old woman suffered from a lifelong history of seeing faces morph into dragon-like faces and reported hallucinating similar faces several times a day. Initially she would recognise the actual faces but after a while they would become black, grew long pointy ears and a protruding snout, displayed reptile-like skin and had large protruding eyes in bright colours. She would see these faces coming towards her several times in a day from objects like electric sockets. She has also had these hallucinations in the dark. She had previously suffered from recurrent headaches, passage hallucinations (to see movements in the corner of the eyes) and zoopsia (she saw large ants crawling over her hands). An MRI of the brain showed minor white-matter abnormalities near the lentiform nucleus and in the semioval center. The visual perceptions she had experienced were attributed to unusual electrophysiological activity in the regions of the brain that are specialised for face and colour in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex.\n\nA 44-year-old woman reported to have begun seeing facial distortions. She perceived that people's faces would change to look more like caricatures of them and her perception worsened over time. She had a history of epilepsy in childhood and had suffered a concussion several years before having this condition, though no medical evidence of seizure was found during distortions. She reported that occasionally she would experience a pixelated vision, like television static and mentioned that these symptoms occurred several times a week with each event lasting from a few minutes to a few hours.\n\nReferences\n\nVisual disturbances and blindness\nVisual perception\nFace recognition\nHallucinations", "machine_text": " Prosopometamorphopsia is a rare and rarefied condition characterized by the individual's visual perception of other people's faces transforming into the faces of familiar figures, often beloved family members, friends and even animals. The condition has been termed \"Metamorphopsia of the Human Face\" and is often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. It was first acknowledged by neurologist and psychiatrist Auguste Bouisson in 1878. People affected by prosopometamorphopsia often first notice the faces of loved ones, such as parents, siblings or children, morphing into the faces of different individuals as they look away from the person and back again. In some cases, the face will change instantaneously, or even switch back and forth between two or more individuals, such as a parent and a pet. In other cases, the transformation occurs slowly and with notable changes in the features seen in the face. The condition is not associated with visual hallucinations, as those affected by prosopometamorphopsia can clearly distinguish between the shifting faces and the actual person in question. It is more likely an issue with visual processing in the brain, as people with temporal lobe epilepsy often experience this issue. This is due to the way in which images and faces are processed, stored and retrieved in the brain, resulting in the misperception that someone's face has changed when it has not. Though prosopometamorphopsia is comparatively rare, it can have a serious impact on social situations. Those affected may become apprehensive of unfamiliar people or environments, as they fear seeing their faces transform. This fear can make socializing, attending social events and going outside difficult for those with the condition. Fortunately, medical professionals are beginning to address this condition. Various treatments are available, including medications, cognitive behavioral therapy and, where necessary, physical therapy. In addition, patients may benefit from support from family and friends, as well as group sessions with individuals who are also affected. Though prosopometamorphopsia remains relatively unknown, it is an increasingly recognised condition. As medical professionals become aware of the symptoms and impact it can have, those affected by it can receive the medical and emotional help they need to manage their condition.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50770806}

It is located on the corner of Grand Boulevard and Mt. Seymour Parkway, and is part of the Core Green Belt of North Vancouver. The park is named for Pauline Vanier, wife of renowned Governor General Georges Vanier. Pauline Vanier was an acclaimed social worker and humanitarian who was active in the North Vancouver area until her death in 1991. She was a founding member of the North Shore Family Court Council and the University Women's Club of North Vancouver, and volunteered for the Women's Centre in Lynn Valley and the North Shore Domestic Violence Agency, now WAVAW (Women Against Violence Against Women). Pauline Vanier Park was opened in the summer of 1988 and features a state of the art playground, tennis courts, a baseball diamond, two tennis courts, and picnic tables. There are also a network of trails and paths that run throughout the park, which are a popular destination for runners and hikers. The park is also home to a number of large sculptures that were created by local sculptor Robert Davidson. These sculptures serve to \u201ccelebrate the unity between nature and the human community\u201d and are the centerpiece of the park. Additionally, Pauline Vanier Park is home to a number of sporting facilities, including a bocce court, basketball court, three baseball diamonds, and two full-size soccer pitches. The park also has its own staging area, which is used for many of the community gatherings throughout the year. Pauline Vanier Park serves as a vital segment of green space for the community of North Vancouver, acting as an outdoor classroom, sanctuary, and place of refuge. The park serves to provide a space for its local community of families and friends to recreate, relax, and enjoy the beauty of the natural environment that surrounds it. In addition to its use as a community park, Pauline Vanier Park is also home to a number of environmentally focused programs, like the internationally acclaimed Vanier Eco Drama program. This program is designed to promote environmental education and stewardship through interactive learning experiences. Pauline Vanier Park is a beloved feature of the North Vancouver landscape, providing its citizens with a space to enjoy various recreational activities and to be surrounded by nature. Additionally, it offers a place to learn and explore how human activity has an impact on the environment.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47635487}

He was the son of Sir William Bedell, and was born in Caen, Normandy, France. In 1825, he matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge. After 1831, he was called to the Bar of England, and was an advocate of the Court of Common Pleas. Throughout his life, Bedell published various works related to Teutonic literature, most notably his translations of Icelandic sagas. In 1844, he published a version of Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson\u2019s Saga, which was the first English translation of this saga. Bedell also translated several Eddic poems, as well as the Rune Poem, which is the only surviving Rune poem in English. Among his other translations were 'Viglundar Saga' from Thomas Thoroddsen and 'Grettis Saga' from George Stephens in 1862. In 1865, Bedell established the University of London's first Chair in Scandinavian Language and Literature. This prompted a resurgence of interest in Scandinavian language and culture, and consequentially led to increased academic activity in this field. It was likely through Bedell\u2019s efforts that Icelandic Studies, and Scandinavian branch of Germanic studies within the University of London, were formed. All of Bedell's translations were of a very high quality, and were greatly admired. His ability to capture the essence of the material he was working with, while still producing a finished product that was understandable to a contemporary English reader, was commended. In addition to his translations, Bedell was also the author of several works on Scandinavian poetics. Bedell\u2019s work had a lasting impact on the scholarship of Teutonic culture and literature. His translations opened up these works to a wider audience, and provided a greater level of materials to be studied and analysed. Through his dedication and passion for Teutonic literature, Capell Bedell has left a legacy of scholarship and enthusiasm for the field which will continue to be studied for many years.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 32562393}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Best of Hilary Duff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Best of Hilary Duff is the first greatest hits album by American recording artist Hilary Duff. It was released on November 11, 2008, by Hollywood Records. The 12-track album consists of eight of Duff's previous singles, as well as two new recordings: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\", and two remixes to the songs. Only one single was released from the album, the Ryan \"Alias\" Tedder-produced \"Reach Out\", which became her third single to chart at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play.\n\nBackground\nDuff confirmed that she had collaborated with a rapper called Prophet on a previously unheard song on the Dignity tour's set list, \"Reach Out\" in September 2007. In an interview with remix producer Joe Bermudez in November 2007, she said that Dignity would be re-released in a CDVU+ edition featuring remixes of the original songs alongside two new tracks: \"Reach Out\" and \"Holiday\". Duff said she hoped to write a third new song for the re-release, and to have \"Holiday\" released as its first or second single;  However, Hollywood Records scrapped the plans, adding to their large list of cancelations, which in turn led Duff to make the decision to leave the label and develop Best of Hilary Duff to quickly end her contract, which had expected one more album.\n\nUnlike Duff's first compilation album Most Wanted (2005), which was advertised as strictly a compilation, Best of was strictly advertised as a greatest hits, making it her first.\n\nCritical reception\n\nBest of Hilary Duff received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic gave the album a positive review stating that Best of Hilary Duff \"is a flipside of her 2005's Most Wanted\", which was \"pitched squarely at bright, happy tweens\". They also went on to say the album \"is not a look back at the past but a blueprint for the future\". Allmusic gave the album a 3.5/5 star rating.\nCommonsensemedia said that \"parents need to know that Miss Duff has turned up the heat with sexually provocative lyrics that may be too hot to handle for younger fans. Hilary Duff isn't for tweens anymore. The hit single \"Reach Out\" features more aggressive sexual lyrics than on previous albums. While Dignity was OK for 11-year-olds, the Best Of compilation pushes the target age higher. The funky remixes and danceable electronic beats are fun and catchy, but the sexed-up lyrics and themes aren't intended for younger fans.\"\nRachel Devitt of Rhapsody said the collection \"is largely pleasant, nicely polished and, rather surprisingly, sleek and even a little edgy. Turns out Lizzie McGuire is a dancefloor diva, and even with that feathery little voice, she manages to work it on tracks like the dark \"Stranger,\" saucy new tune \"Reach Out\" and a clubby remix of \"Dignity.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nOn November 29, 2008, Best of Hilary Duff debuted at number 125 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 5,500 copies in its first week of release in the US, making it her least successful album to date. Many people believe this was due to a lack of promotion from her record label at the time Hollywood Records and her change in sound of music which many believe resulted in Duff losing some of her younger fans. This is her first album not to receive any RIAA certifications. As of September 2012, the album has sold over 35,000 copies in the United States alone.\n\nSingles\n\"Reach Out\" was released as the only single from the album.

The Foy name is particularly numerous in County Leitrim, where records show that several separate Foy families were living there by 1845. The Foys in America The earliest American record of the Foy family name dates back to 1785, when Richard Foy was recorded in South Carolina. Later records show that the Foys spread across the United States to the Mid-West, the South, the North-East and the West Coasts. The family name has become popular in the United States, with a large presence in California, Florida, New York, and Texas.

She was the daughter of Joseph Reynell, a very influential colonial official of the British Empire. She served in the royal court of England for more than fifty years and became known for her skill in diplomacy and handling social matters. Reynell was an influential figure in the social elite, attending parties and other events. She was a popular guest at the balls of the Earl of Devon and the Duchess of Devonshire. Her connections to the upper classes made her useful to those who sought her aid. Reynell also artfully managed her own behavior to aid her husband, Charles Reynell. She gained fame for her ability to maneuver her husband's career, and made sure to keep him in the circle of the English aristocracy. In 1746, Reynell retired from the court to care for her ailing husband. She became known for the Christian charities she supported, such as the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows and Children. She was well-respected and widely admired for her dedication to the underprivileged. Reynell was an avid gardener, and is noted for helping to establish the garden house style of estate planning. During her time at court, she employed experienced groundskeepers and gardeners to create varied and elegant gardens around her estate. Reynell was a beloved figure among the English elite, and her death in 1779 was greatly mourned. Though she had passed away without leaving an extensive estate, she received a sizable bequest from the late Earl of Devon in honour of her service to his court. Diana Reynell is remembered today as a strong female figure in English court life and an example of how one's dedication to their duties can be rewarded. Her influence and gracious manner remain an exemplary image of how a successful courtier should be.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 55174981}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fantastic Wounds\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fantastic Wounds is the second studio album by Seattle horror punk band Schoolyard Heroes. Like the band's first album The Funeral Sciences, it was released through the record label The Control Group. Following the band's first release, they had generated success with the underground Seattle rock scene and had secured a small cult following, largely due to the reputation they had built from their concert tour with Vendetta Red.\n\nAll four members of the band recorded the album while living at the same University District together. The production of the album was handled by Joe Reineke and T. Dallas Reed, with the majority of the lyrics composed by the band's singer and frontman Ryann Donnelly. Donnelly serves as the main singer on the album, with bassist Jonah Bergman performing backing vocals. Taking influence from horror films, lyrically the album features macabre subject matter and social commentary. The band expressed the desire to become more diverse with their musical approach than on their debut album, citing a larger list of influences. The album presents some of its themes in a theatrical, over-the-top and often campy style.\n\nIt was promoted by the single \"They Live\", which received a music video. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Donnelly's singing, the progression that the band had showcased from their prior work, and the humorous way that the morbid themes were expressed on the project. While a critical success, the album failed to achieve any chart positions. The success of the album lead to the release of their final album Abominations released in 2007.\n\nBackground\n\nThe debut album by Schoolyard Heroes, The Funeral Sciences was an underground success, selling over 5000 copies. Following the release of their album, the band promoted themselves with a concert tour with Seattle-based band Vendetta Red. While on tour the band simultaneously worked on their second album. The band quickly developed a reputation for their eccentric, often shocking live performances, and began to develop a cult following. They were noted for their prolific nature and their frequent live performances and touring.\n\nFor their sophomore release, the band chose to stay with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red was the best thing that could have happened to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.\n\nWriting and recording\n\nAll four members of Schoolyard Heroes lived together at the Seattle University District during the recording of Fantastic Wounds. Vocalist Ryan Donnelly noted that during the production of the album the band didn't do drugs or drink alcohol, and instead spent their time playing video games and eating fast food. Between recording sessions, the band spent their loose time watching episodes of classic horror series like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.\n\nThe album's style progresses from the one found in The Funeral Sciences; the more pop heavy aesthetic exhibited on that album was replaced with themes found within heavy metal music, and was more forceful and \"merciless\" in nature. Conceptual themes found within their first project are maintained on Fantastic Wounds, including lyrics inspired by science fiction and horror films. Like all of the band's projects, the album takes several of its themes from b-movies and horror films. Horror films had always been a substantial influence on the band; bassist Jonah Bergman's father had taken him to double features as a kid. According to Bergman, the band had grown quite a lot from their first album and had learned more about producing and recording music. Bergman, when describing the album, mused, \"honestly, these are 10 of the most fucking killer songs I've ever heard in my life,\" stating that the album perfectly embodied the type of music the band wished to produce.\n\nAccording to Donnelly, the band had been working together for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't know what else to do with her life. She described the band as a work of passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused:\n\n\u201cI am so very happy with this record\u2014both with the performances and the production. Blood, sweat and tears went into its making. It was the longest we\u2019d spent on anything ever we\u2019ve done. We knew how we wanted it to sound and we wanted to get it perfect, so yeah, we spent a long time on it. And I tell you; we had to make a lot of tough choices, with the sequencing. We wanted it to be perfect, we wanted all the different energies to flow into each other just so.\u201d\n\nWhile the album was influenced by things such as macabre horror tales, zombies, and monsters, Donelly assured that the album was \u201calways about something much more real\", musing that \"there\u2019s so much genuine evil in the world. That said, I love that people take all kinds of different things away from our songs, and invest so much of themselves in their interpretations.\u201d To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music.\n\nBergman cited his desire to one day perform in Graceland as another influence on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he would one day be able to perform there. Bergman commented \"I used to sit in my bedroom and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'\". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single \"They Live\".\n\nContent\n\nAlbum opener \"Body Shots\" serves as an introduction to the style of the album. The song is barely one minute in length, compared to the duration of the majority of the songs on the album which are around four minutes long. The song contains singing by Donnelly that is largely scream-based, with guitar riffing taking influence from thrash metal. The track showcases guitarist Steve Bonnell's math rock-driven and largely melodic riffs that dominate the opening song. \"Body Shots\" has been described as a trailer for the rest of the album; the overall tone and energy of the song has been cited as a teaser for the rest of the album.\n\nThe next song, \"Panic in the Year Zero\",  boasts a chorus that invokes the Iron Maiden song \"Run to the Hills\". The song has been called epic in nature, with guitar playing influenced by the playing of Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. Donnelly's vocal performance has been compared to that of Bruce Dickinson on the song. The song waltzes over topics like the apocalypse and features Donnelly singing \"say your prayers\" in a multitude of ways. Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine views that \"Year Zero\" showcases some of the lighter themes of the album, summarizing:\n\n\"Believe me, there is nothing like a female singer who can step up and belt out the lines, yet has enough Sauv\u00e9 Fair to finesse the lighter side of the material, and \"Panic In The Year Zero\" is a perfect example of that. If the vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the meat and potatoes, delivering resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always keeping it interesting.\" \n\n\"Serial Killers Know How to Party\" is tongue-in-cheek and somewhat comical in nature, heavily influences by horror films. Donnelly shouts \"your screams could raise the dead\" over a fast-paced guitar riff. \"Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\" is reinforced with a double-bass panel, a technique that allows the drumming to sound more clear. Both \"Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\" and \"Battlestar Anorexia\" channel some of the thematic similarities as the act Betty Blowtorch. On \"They Live\", Donelly boasts the line \u201ccome with me, you pretty thing, and we\u2019ll celebrate with amputations.\u201d The song is named from the John Carpenter film, They Live. \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" features a foreboding atmosphere, fueled by a progressive math-rock style of production, with some disco influences as well.\n\n\"Funeral Parlor Tricks\" features widely different styles of production during its running time. \"Nothing Cleanses Quite Like a Fire\" and album closer \"The Girl Who Was Born Without a Face\" relay themes of pulp violence.\n\nReception\n\nExclaim! critic Sam Sutherland felt that the band had successfully progressed from their debut album, musing \"more polished than their debut, this record possesses all the angular riffs and math-rock breakdowns of their previous work, but is greatly aided by a sense of cohesion between their colliding influences and disparate style of songwriting\", describing the album \"as fantastic as its title suggests.\" Ernest Simpson of TrebleZine called Donnelly the Seattle-based Karen O, and wrote that \"don't be surprised if Schoolyard Heroes leap to a major or at least a larger indie label after the success of Fantastic Wounds.\" Roger Holland of PopMatters viewed that the band had begun as a juvenile pop-punk with only a few unique ideas, calling Fantastic Wounds a \"thing of pure kinetic beauty\". According to Holland, the album was \"polished, perfected and just generally worked up into something quiet shiny and special. On the debut, the influences were everywhere, suffocating the spark. But the new songs, with names like \u201cPanic in the Year Zero\u201d, \u201cNightmare At 20,000 Feet\u201d and \u201cThe Girl Who Was Born Without a Face\u201d are confident, complex and strong enough to give this young band its own fierce identity.\"\n\nSeattle Weekly critic Michaelangelo Matos viewed that while Donnelly was the standout of the album, stating that the band was \"neither a rock Diamanda nor a mere hood ornament; Schoolyard Heroes' ghastly gestalt feeds on at least four entities\", and that the album was launched by a triplet-driven solo performance by Jonah Bergman. Decoy's music Brandon Carter compared the band favorably to a train wreck, commenting that the band could be viewed \"in the same fashion as a train wreck you just can\u2019t bring yourself to look away, for fear that you might miss something\", continuing that \"however, what you\u2019d miss if you turned away from this band is a fearsome onslaught of shrieks, screams, and raw energy.\" Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine reported that style-wise the band was not be for everyone, commenting that |but for those select few who appreciate the movement and atmosphere created here, they will find a technically judicious band that leads with good hooks and follows through with great substance to create an album that is wholly worth it, back to front.\"\n\nJessica Grose of Spin viewed that Donnelly seems \"to be lobbying for goth poster girl of the new millennium\", stating that the album successfully bordered on both metal and punk influences. Three Imaginary Girls mused that Fantastic Wounds maintained the \"acrobatic inter-instrumental dynamics and savagely clever, at times genuinely affecting modern-life-as-horror-movie lyrics that defined their awesome debut, The Funeral Sciences\", and noted that it \"lacks a bit in the insouciant exuberance displayed by its predecessor.\" The same website later listed the album amongst their 100 best albums of the year at number 18. While not charting on any music charts, the album was a commercial success, selling 1500 copies in its first week of release.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel \nInformation taken from Fantastic Wounds liner notes.\n\n Jonah Bergman - bass, Vocals, primary artist\n Steve Bonnell - guitar, primary artist\n Ryann Donnelly - vocals, primary artist\n Nouela Oake Johnston - fender rhodes, keyboards\n Jeff Kleinsmith - artwork\n T.

This phenomenon is often seen in science fiction, fantasy and horror literature, films and games where characters are able to heal rapidly and return to a healthy physical state without any visible scars and with no medical intervention or magical powers. The concept was popularized in the early twentieth century when authors began applying it to their fantasy and horror stories. This concept is similar to what is often referred to as \"rapid healing\" in real world medical situations, where a wound might heal quickly without any medical intervention. The phenomenon is common in video games, especially those of the RPG genre. In fantasy and horror literature, it is common for characters to have wounds such as cuts, bruises, and other injuries that appear to heal miraculously; characters that have been killed may even be resurrected using magical powers. Such instances often have no explanation, often strange creatures with abilities beyond normal humans can have this power. In some cases, the phenomenon may not be supernatural at all, but could be caused by scientific or technological advances. In the science fiction genre, characters may have been implanted with cybernetic devices that repair or heal themselves, or perhaps subjected to nanotechnology treatments that allow them to heal quickly. In media settings where magic is commonplace, magical healings are often seen in many settings. Regardless of the origin, the idea of Fantastic Wounds serves to provide a sense of wonder and awe as characters seem to be able to heal themselves quickly from wounds of any severity. It can symbolize the strength of a hero, as their body is able to heal from an injury that might have killed a normal person. It can also be used as a plot device to allow a character to survive until the story's climax or to further the development of a character. In conclusion, Fantastic Wounds is a fictional phenomenon often found in literature, films, and video games that is characterized as the act of characters whose wounds and injuries magically heal without the help of medicine. It is a popular concept often used for both its symbolic and plot-driving aspects.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2861838}

Discovered in 1974, the field represents one of the largest oil accumulations in Russia and provides over one-third of Russia's natural gas production. The field covers approximately 2,400 km\u00b2 of the northern Russian permafrost, including the Chayanda Bay of the Pechora Sea. Recent developments in Chayanda field include the Chayanda Gas and Condensate Facilities, which began operation in 2008 and has been hailed as one of the world's most advanced gas production systems. The facility is a joint venture between Shell and Gazprom, with Shell holding a controlling 50.1 percent stake. The Chayanda Gas and Condensate Facility processes, compresses, and cools natural gas and condensate produced in the area. The facility serves as a hub for local production, which includes crude oil, dry gas and associated liquids. The majority of natural gas is transported to consumers via the Northern Pipeline System, while the condensate is delivered to the port of Murmansk for export. In addition to the Chayanda Gas and Condensate Facility, a new Chayanda shallow gas facility is also in the works. This facility will produce over 0.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas on an annual basis, making it one of the key components of Russia's gas industry. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in late 2018 and be completed by 2020. In recent years Chayanda field has become an important contributor to the Russian economy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nusach (Jewish custom)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In Judaism, Nusach ( nusa\u0127, modern pronunciation nusakh or n\u00fasakh), plural nuschaot () or nusachim () refers to the exact text of a prayer service; sometimes the English word \"rite\" is used to refer to the same thing. Texts used by different communities include Nosach Teiman, Nusach Ashkenaz, Nusach Sefard, Nusach Edot Hamizrach, and Nusach Ari. In English, the word nusach means formulate, wording. \n\nTextual nusach is distinct from musical nusach, which refers to the musical style or tradition of a community, particularly the chant used for recitative prayers such as the Amidah.\n\nMeanings\nNusach primarily means \"text\" or \"version\", the correct wording of a religious text or liturgy. Thus, the nusach tefillah is the text of the prayers, either generally or in a particular community.\n\nIn common use, nusach has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is one example of minhag, which includes traditions on Jewish customs of all types.\n\nVarieties\n\nNusach Ashkenaz\n\nNusach Ashkenaz is the style of service conducted by Ashkenazi Jews, originating from central and eastern Europe. It is the shortest lengthwise (except for the \"Baladi\" Yemenite Nusach).\n\nIt may be subdivided into the German, or western, branch (\"Minhag Ashkenaz\"), used in western and central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian branch (\"Minhag Polin\"), used in eastern Europe, the United States and among Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as \"Lithuanian\", in Israel.\n\nThe form used in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (except Canada, which follows the American style), known as \"Minhag Anglia\"  \nis technically a subform of \"Minhag Polin\" but has many similarities to the German rite. See Singer's Siddur.\n\nNusach Sefard\n\nNusach Sefard is the style of service used by some Jews of central and eastern European origins, especially Hasidim, who adopted some Sephardic customs emulating the practice of the Ari's circle of kabbalists, most of whom lived in the Land of Israel. Textually speaking it is based on the Sephardic rite, but in melody and feel it is overwhelmingly Ashkenazi.\n\nNusach Ari\n\nNusach Ari is a variant of Nusach Sefard, used by Chabad Hasidim.\n\nSephardi and Mizrachi nuschaot\n\nThere is not one generally recognized uniform nusach for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews.  Instead, Sephardim and Mizrahim follow several slightly different but closely related nuschaot.\n\nThe nearest approach to a standard text is found in the siddurim printed in Livorno from the 1840s until the early 20th century.  These (and later versions printed in Vienna) were widely used throughout the Sephardic and Mizrahi world.  Another popular variant was the text known as Nusach ha-Hida, named after Chaim Yosef David Azulai.  Both these versions were particularly influential in Greece, Iran, Turkey and North Africa.  However, most communities also had unwritten customs which they would observe, rather than following the printed siddurim exactly: it is easy, from the printed materials, to get the impression that usage in the Ottoman Empire around 1900 was more uniform than it really was.\n\nOther variants include:\nthe customs of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, based on an older form of the Castilian rite, with some influence from the customs both of Italian Jews and of Northern Morocco.  This version is distinguished by the near-absence of Kabbalistic elements.\nNusah Adot Hamizrah, originating among Iraqi Jews but now popular in many other communities.  These are based on the opinions of Yosef Hayyim and have a strong Kabbalistic flavour.\nMinhag Aram Soba, as used by Syrian Musta'arabi Jews in earlier centuries (the current Syrian rite is closely based on the Livorno prints).\nthe Moroccan rite, also related to the text of the Livorno prints but with a strong local flavour.  This subdivides into the customs of the Spanish-speaking northern strip and the Arabic-speaking interior of the country.\nformerly, there were variants from different parts of Spain and Portugal, perpetuated in particular synagogues in Thessaloniki and elsewhere, e.g. the Lisbon and Catalan rites, and some North African rites appear to reflect Catalan as well as Castilian influence.\n\nUnder the influence of the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, many Israeli Sephardim have adopted a nusach based largely on the Nusach Edot Hamizrach but omitting some of the Kabbalistic additions.\n\nNosach Teman\n\nA \"Temani\" nosach was the standard among the Jews of Yemen. This is divided into the Baladi (purely Yemenite) and Shami (adopted from Sephardic siddurim) versions. Both rites are recited using the unique Yemenite pronunciation of Hebrew, which Yemenite Jews, and some scholars, regard as the most authentic, and most closely related to the Hebrew of Ancient Israel.\n\nThe Baladi rite is very close to that codified by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah. One form of it is used by the Dor Daim, who attempt to safeguard the older Baladi tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance. This version used by dardaim was originally used by all Yemenite Jews near the time of Maimonides.\n\nNussach Eretz Yisrael\nIn the period of the Geonim, Jews in Israel followed the Nussach Eretz Yisrael which is based upon the Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud), while the Jewish diaspora followed the customs of Babylonian Jewry. \n\nThe modern Nusach Eretz Yisrael is a recent attempt by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim at reconstructing the ancient Nussach Eretz Yisrael, based on the Jerusalem Talmud and documents discovered in the Cairo Geniza and other sources. The reconstruction is published in the form of a siddur (\"prayer book\"), and used by Rabbi Bar-Hayim's Jerusalem followers in public prayers held in Machon Shilo's synagogue.\n\nOther nuschaot\nIn addition, there are other nuschaot.\nNussach HaGR\"A was a very brief version of Nussach Ashkenaz written by the Vilna Gaon, removing some passages which he believed had were not in the original prayer text, correcting some grammatical errors (according to him), and some additional small changes.\nThe Minhag Italiani and Minhag Ben\u00e8 Rom\u00ec are used by some Italian Jews, as well as by a small number of minyanim in Jerusalem and Netanya.\nClosely related to these was the \"Romaniote\" rite from  Greece where have lived an ancient, pre-Diaspora Jewish community.  The surviving Romaniote synagogues are in Ioannina, Chalkis, Athens, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and New York, these now use a Sephardic rite but with romaniote variations, romaniote piyyutim, combined with own melodies and customs and their special form of Byzantine-Jewish Cantillation.  There were formerly Romaniote synagogues in Istanbul. (The customs of Corfu are a blend between Romaniote, Apulian and Sephardic rites.)\nThere was once a French nusach, closely related to the Ashkenazi, which is now used only in certain towns in Northern Italy (see Appam).\nDistinct Persian and Proven\u00e7al nuschaot also existed before being gradually replaced by the Edot Hamizrach and Spanish and Portuguese nuschaot respectively.\n The Urfalim Jews of south eastern Anatolia follow their own prayer rite, which differs from the Syrian, Kurdish and Iraqi Jewish rites.\n\nIt is said among some mystics that an as-yet undisclosed nusach will be revealed after the coming of the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah. Others say that the differences in nusach are derived from differences between the twelve tribes of Israel, and that in Messianic times each tribe will have its proper nusach. The concept of one nusach for each of the 12 tribes was formulated by R' Isaac Luria; at the time there were exactly 12 Jewish communities in Luria's city of Safed, and each community's nusach was meant to stand in place of that of one of the tribes.\n\nHalakhot\n\nAccording to Rabbi David Bar-Hayim, halakha permits a Jew to change his nusach at any time, even on a daily basis. Most halakhic authorities dispute this, and assume that one should follow the nusach of his family, or at the very least follow one nusach consistently.\n\nSee also\nMinhag\nSiddur\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  A Historical Map of Jewish Liturgical Influence and Variation\n  Western Ashkenazi Nusach\n  Audio and text from the traditional Siddur SiddurAudio.com\n\n \nJewish music\nYiddish words and phrases\nYiddish words and phrases in Jewish law\nHebrew words and phrases in Jewish prayers and blessings\nHebrew words and phrases in Jewish law", "machine_text": " Nusach (\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7) is a Jewish custom related to the reference and composition of prayers. It describes how certain prayers and blessings should be said in order to conform to established Jewish law and usage. Due to the wide range of different customs and overall non-specific Jewish law on prayer, there is no one single standard definition of nusach. Generally, it itself is defined as a standard set of prayer formulations accepted by a particular group of Jews. The practice of having a single agreed-upon \"nusach\" originated in the Land of Israel prior to the spread of Jewish populations into the diaspora. This development can mainly be attributed to the syncretizing of Jewish customs with the environment and culture of the local Christian and Muslim inhabitants. For example, there is evidence that certain Christian symbols found on the architectural interiors of early Christian churches such as Jerusalem\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre were absorbed into the tradition of nusach. As time progressed, the relative informality of Jewish life allowed for more fluidity in what could be said in prayer and which prayers were emphasized. By the 19th century, certain movements and philosophies had emerged that attempted to standardize the prayer traditions so that all branches of Judiasm would simply use a single nusach across all branches. Among the most influential proponents of this approach was Rabbi Akiva Eiger. The modern-day concept of a \"nusach\" has evolved from this long history. Most commonly, it consists of a standard compilation of prayers in a particular style, with some variations between the denominations of Jews and between geographical locations. It is a very useful tool in that it helps people of different backgrounds pray together in harmony and strive for communal and individual growth in prayer. Nusach is also closely connected to the concept of Jewish minhag; that is, the need for Jewish individuals and communities to adopt their own accepted set of practices. This means that modern Jews can vary widely in their expression of the nusach, even if they are using the same texts. Since nusach is closely intertwined with the spirituality of Judaism, it is seen as an integral part of one\u2019s religious experience. As such, it is important for preserving the tradition of Jewish prayer and making sure that its rituals remain as meaningful as ever.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2457629}

Monkey D. Luffy and his crew must stop Shiki from carrying out his plans.\n\nPlot \n uses his Devil Fruit powers to destroy marine ships and warn Monkey D. Garp and Fleet Admiral Sengoku. On a floating island, Monkey D. Luffy is chased by a genetically-enhanced animal. The monster is overpowered by the other monsters before Luffy defeats the fourth monster. The Straw Hats have been separated into three groups: Sanji with Usopp, Roronoa Zoro with Tony Tony Chopper, and Nico Robin with Franky and Brook. Shiki tells Nami that she has been taken to the island against her will and a brief flashback is shown: several days earlier, the Straw Hats read news of an attack on East Blue. Luffy vows to protect the East Blue before witnessing Shiki's ship overhead. After escaping a storm, Shiki meets Nami and reveals his powers to make any inanimate object he touches float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning, Shiki offers to take them there before abducting Nami. The others try to rescue her, but Shiki makes the pirates scatter on the island.\n\nShiki asks Nami to become his navigator but she refuses. His minion  demonstrates an evolved bird called , who can produce electricity, but Shiki rejects it after Dr. Indigo is electrocuted. He reveals that a plant, called IQ, can cause animals to evolve instantly and to increase strength along the way. Nami protects Billy, and the bird is left with her as Shiki and his men leave. Meanwhile, Sanji and Usopp battle various animals while Sanji searches for Robin and Nami. Meanwhile, Zoro and Chopper rescue a young girl, , and are led to her village and are told about the large poisonous plants around the village. However, long term exposure to the plants is poisonous to humans, and the girl's grandmother has become ill by it. Xiao was looking for the cure which is the IQ plant, but Shiki has stolen the IQ plants for his experiments. Sanji and Usopp learn that Shiki also takes all the men and young women to his royal palace, leaving the village with only the very young and old, before meeting up with Zoro and Chopper.\n\nNami flees with the help of Billy, and finds the Thousand Sunny along with Luffy. Robin's group discovers that Shiki is planning to release the animals on the island into East Blue to force the World Government's surrender and that he is planning a demonstration against a village on the floating island to show their power. The two join the others at the village, and they also learn of the plan from the village residents. Shiki confronts and defeats the Straw Hats and offers Nami to rejoin him on the condition that the Cocoyashi Village will be spared. Robin's group arrives and rejoin the rest of the crew. Xiao gives them a tone dial and they replay Nami's farewell message to Luffy, but he angrily leaves before the end.\n\nMeanwhile, Nami attempts to destroy the plants protecting his palace, but gets poisoned herself. Shiki traps her near the plants and heads off to meet the pirate captains gathering. While greeting them, the Straw Hats launch a preemptive strike against Shiki and his henchmen. The group manages to defeat them while Chopper and Usopp are ordered to search for Nami. Nami is found by Billy who helps destroy the plants just as Usopp and Chopper arrive. Chopper soon realizes the only way to save Nami is to find the IQ medicine, but Shiki attempts to stop them. Luffy engages Shiki in a duel. The two find the IQ plant, but find the medicine is being held by Dr. Indigo. Zoro manages to defeat Dr. Indigo and Nami recovers.

The other Straw Hats escape with the Thousand Sunny, using Shiki's pirate sail as a parachute. Luffy is recovered by Billy while the villagers are shown flying away using the wings on their arms. The Marines capture the retreating pirates, including Shiki. As the Marines witness the islands crash into the sea, now free of Shiki's power, they spot the Thousand Sunny.

Chris Beveridge of The Fandom post described the film as \"a very streamlined Oda story that would have gone on for twenty or thirty episodes if it was done as a regular arc with the TV series\", adding that the storyline was \"predictable\" but also \"well polished\". Beveridge also praised the film for having a stronger connection to the One Piece TV series than the franchises previous films. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network awarded the film a 'B' rating, praising the storyline and character design. Silverman commented that \"no one can come up with weird laughs or monsters quite like Oda\", although unfavorably comparing some of the animation to \"stop-motion animation\". Silverman also commented on the English dubbing of the film, saying that Ian Sinclair's debut as Brook \"does a very good job with the loopy skeleton\", although she found Scott McNeil's \"pseudo-Caribbean\" accent as Shiki \"a little off-putting\". Despite being largely unfamiliar with the franchise, Kyle Mills of DVD Talk called FUNimations release \"Highly Recommended\", praising the \"terrific cast of characters\" and \"giant kick ass final fight\". Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com also recommended Strong World, describing it as \"loud, frenetic and frequently nonsensical,\" but also \"kind of crazily entertaining at the same time\" Kauffman also added that \"while Strong World won't necessarily be incomprehensible to newcomers\", \"those with a solid grounding in the background of the story and its many characters will reap the most rewards from this particular outing\".\nStrong World also currently has a rating of 7.1 out of 10 collated from both film critics and users on IMDb.\n\nAwards and nominations \nIt won the award for Excellent Animation of the Year at the 34th Japan Academy Prize and is nominated for Animation of the Year.\n\nSee also\n List of One Piece films\n List of One Piece media\n List of 2009 box office number-one films in Japan\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Toei Animation \n\n2009 films\nJapanese films\n2009 anime films\nFunimation\nToei Animation films\nStrong World\nFilms scored by Kohei Tanaka", "machine_text": " One Piece Film: Strong World is a 2009 Japanese animated fantasy action-adventure film written and directed by the well-known director Munehisa Sakai.

Further fortified in the Middle Ages, tradition holds that it was for several centuries the seat of Clan MacKinnon. It is located east of Kirkibost on the west shore of Loch Slapin.\n\nHistory \nThe original structure of Dun Ringill is consistent with an Iron Age Broch dating to approximately the first years of the common era. The main and subordinate structures were occupied and modified throughout its history until the 19th century. Tradition relates that the structure was occupied by the MacKinnons as their clan seat well before the 16th century. It is mentioned in historical texts in the 16th century, after which the MacKinnons moved their seat to Dunakin.<ref name=\"Lochalsh' pp. 39-43\">The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp. 39-43. Miket, R., and Roberts, D. Birlin Limited, 2007, .</ref>\n\n Description \n\nDun Ringill today is a stacked stone ruin overlooking Loch Slapin. The present structure is approximately  in height and  on each side, with a ditch following the outer wall. Its most notable feature is the central landward facing doorway approximately  high that leads into the center of the structure. The interior of the structure contained two rectangular buildings measuring . The original layout was similar to that of a broch, a form of complex Atlantic roundhouse.\n\nA stone wall foundation encloses area adjacent to the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation. A site survey has shown that there are remains of other buildings in the immediate vicinity; and although their age is uncertain, it is likely their construction and occupation was throughout the history of Dun Ringill up until the 19th century.\n\nTo the north and west is a hilly coastal plain. Loch Slapin lies to the east and south of the structure. On either side of the structure are earth and stone ramps that descend down to the ocean. These ramps likely allowed easy access to the water and shipping. Since roads in this part of Skye did not exist until recent times, sea travel was the predominant mode of transportation.\n\n In popular culture \nThe rock band Jethro Tull performed a song entitled \"Dun Ringill\" on their 1979 Stormwatch album.  The lyrics call for a meeting down by Dun Ringill during the wee hours of a stormy night, when \"we'll watch the old gods play.\" The song was written by Tull leader Ian Anderson, who lived at Kilmarie House, within walking distance of Dun Ringill, at the time.\n\n Notes \n\n References \n Scotland Blue Guide, A&C Black, London, 12th Edition, 2001, .\n Scotland an Oxford Archaeological Guide, Oxford University Press, 1998, \n The Medieval Castles of Skye and Lochalsh pp.\u00a039\u201343.

It is believed to be the site of a 6th century village that served as a stronghold of the Clan Donald during the Middle Ages. The fort was used to control the Sound of Sleat and control trade along the coastal routes. The fort is surrounded by a series of stone walls and deep trenches, and is located at the top of a rocky hill on the Strathaird peninsula. The name Dun Ringill derives from the Gaelic for \"fort of the little promontory\", as it was located on a rock overlooking the sea. The site has been occupied since prehistory, but it is its medieval history that is most visible today. The site was likely constructed in the 6th century AD to provide a fortified stronghold for members of the Clan Donald, spreading their control over the northern isles of Skye and Raasay. The walls, which date back to the early 5th century, are made of rough stones with foundations of hewn stone and earth. The walls are up to 7m tall, and are highly visible from surrounding areas due to the fort being situated on a hillside. The fort is thought to have been built to provide protection to the Clan Donald, who led a series of raiding parties against their Norse and Scandinavian enemies. The walls could have served both defensive and symbolic purposes, as they declared the Clan's presence and authority in the area. The fort was also likely used as a harbor where ships could dock and unload their goods, and is situated near the entrance to Kyle Rhea, a former sea route between Skye and the Scottish mainland. This would have made Dun Ringill a strategic place for trade, fishing and even smuggling. Today, Dun Ringill remains an impressive and atmospheric Iron Age fort. It has been used in films, music videos and documentaries, and is a popular destination for tourists visiting Skye. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest, with much of the masonry dating back to the Late Iron Age period. The fort is open to the public and the National Trust for Scotland has established an interpretation centre at the site to provide information about the history and cultural heritage of the site. Dun Ringill is an important reminder of Scotland's past and provides a unique insight into the history and culture of the region. It still stands as a testament to the power and authority of the Clan Donald.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18051066}

Incumbent Republican United States Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen won re-election to a third term in office over Democratic challenger Paul Douglas, a former University of Chicago economics professor and United States Senator from 1949 to 1967. Securing 55.90% of the vote, Dirksen defeated Douglas by a substantial margin of 131,188 votes. Dirksen, who was first elected to the United States Senate in 1950, was a popular figure at the time of the election. While not untroubled in his bid for re-election, his large lead in the polls and strong support from incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower enabled Dirksen to prevail in the election with comparative ease. Douglas, a Democratic politician, had previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois from 1949 to 1967. He challenged Dirksen\u2019s re-election bid in 1956, and attended a series of political forums and debates during the campaign. His effort failed, however, and he was unable to overtake the incumbent Senator\u2019s commanding lead. In the end, Dirksen\u2019s victory was largely attributable to strong support from President Eisenhower, who campaigned for his re-election bid in Illinois in the months leading up to the election, as well as Dirksen\u2019s well-known popularity among the state\u2019s voters. Dirksen\u2019s victory would represent the fourth of his six consecutive terms in the United States Senate. The election saw moderate voter turnout, with 2,282,863 ballots counted across the state.

He was credited with leading Statoil's transformation into a major international energy company. Karlson was born in Oslo, Norway, and grew up on an island outside Bergen. He began his career in 1963 with the Norwegian oil company Esso, where he worked as an exploration geologist. After a few years, he moved on to A/S Marathon Oil Norway, which later merged with Elf Aquitaine, where he served in various positions, eventually becoming executive vice president. In 1988, he was appointed CEO of Statoil and given the task of transitioning the largely state-owned energy company into a private, commercially-oriented firm. Under Karlson's leadership, Statoil internationalized its operations, opening subsidiaries across Europe and North America, and eventually expanding its presence to countries like India, China and Brazil. Karlson was an advocate of technology and innovation, and he implemented a number of initiatives to maximize Statoil's potential. Under his guidance, the company pioneered advanced reservoir monitoring technologies, as well as seismic imaging and drilling techniques which allowed the company to explore and develop resources in deepwater or hard-to-reach places. Karlson was also a key figure in the development of Norway's petroleum industry, and was an advisor to the Norwegian government on energy issues. During his tenure as Statoil's CEO, Karlson became known for his corporate reforms and strategies, which enabled Statoil to become one of the world's leading oil companies. Karlson retired from Statoil in 2003 and died in November 2018, at the age of 80.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Congolese Air Force (, or FAC) is the air force branch of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa). From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).\n\nHistory \n\nShortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.\n\nA Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964\u20131968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.\n\nIn July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the  (FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.\n\nIn July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974\u201375 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.\n\nThe Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called \"special missions\", consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.\n\nIn the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. The  at Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.\n\nThe extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.\n\nThe FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.\n\nCurrent structure \nAs of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.\n\nLike the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.\n\nKnown chiefs of staff\nMajor General Faustin Munene in 1997\nBrigadier General Jean Bitanihirwa Kamara in 2005\nMajor General Djedje Ndamba in 2006\nMajor General John Numbi in 2007\nMajor General Rigobert Massamba Musungu from 2007\nBrigadier General (Major General from July 2018) Numbi Ngoie Enoch since 2014\n\nAircraft \nAccording to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.\nJane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.\nThe DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi. It was delivered in 2005. AFM says that a second Mi-26 prepared for the DRC has been stored with Skytech at Li\u00e8ge Airport, Belgium since at least June 2002.

The Air Force is commanded by the Chief of the Air Staff, appointed by the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The FAC has a number of bases located across the country, including Kamina Air Base and Kinshasa Air Base. The Air Force also has an active role in peacekeeping operations within and outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has provided transport for United Nations forces, as well as medical evacuation and air support during the various conflicts in the region. In 2020, the Air Force deployed personnel to the Central African Republic as part of a United Nations mission to bring stability to the country.

In 2014, the FAC launched a joint exercise with the Cameroon Air Force, which included simulated air-to-air combat and air intercept exercises. In 2017, the FAC took part in a series of exercises with the Rwandese Air Force, which focused on air defense and combat tactics.

Prior to her parliamentary career, she was the finance director of a technology consultancy, teacher, and a parish councillor.\n\nEarly life\nCates was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, and attended King Edward VII School. She studied genetics at the University of Cambridge, obtained a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from Sheffield Hallam University, and worked as a science teacher in a school in Sheffield. She then became the finance director of the technology consultancy, Redemption Media. Cates co-owns the company with her husband.\n\nPolitical career\n\nLocal councillor\nCates was elected in 2015 as a parish councillor for Oughtibridge Ward on Bradfield Parish Council. She was re-elected in 2019. Cates stood as a Conservative candidate for Stannington ward in the 2018 Sheffield City Council election and joined the party in the same year. She received 898 votes and finished third behind the Liberal Democrats candidates.\n\nMember of Parliament\nCates was selected as the Conservative candidate for Penistone and Stocksbridge on 24 October 2018. She had previously supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum but, during the election campaign, commented she had since changed her mind and supported Brexit. Cates was elected as MP in the 2019 general election with a majority of 7,210 (14.5%) on a swing of 8.6% from Labour to the Conservatives.\n\nAfter her election, it was reported that a mobile app was launched in 2014 by Redemption Media, a company co-owned by Cates and her husband, charged foodbanks for the services that it provided. Cates commented on this by stating that the app had been developed for free, and that the first foodbank to use it had not been charged. After the app was expanded to other foodbanks, there was a set-up charge which was used to help cover development and training costs, and that by joining the app they also received a complimentary subscription to JustGiving. The first client of the app was the S6 Foodbank based at St. Thomas' Church and run by Network Church Sheffield. They piloted the app in 2012 before its national launch in 2014. Cates and her family are members of St. Thomas' Church and she was the operations director of Network Church Sheffield from 2016 to 2018.\n\nIn June 2021, in an article for online magazine UnHerd, Cates criticised the focus on protecting the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic as in her opinion it only had a short-term impact on the \"longevity of older people\" and that emphasis should have been on \"the long term impact of lockdowns on young peoples' lives\". \n\nIn October 2021, she wrote an article in The Daily Telegraph where Cates stated that biological sex was unchangeable and that it eroded the rights of women to say that trans women were women. When asked about the article in an interview for GB News, she clarified that she did not oppose trans women who had undergone sex reassignment therapy from having equivalent rights but did oppose self-identification and gender fluidity as she felt that it posed a danger to women. In November 2021, during a parliamentary session, Cates warned schools against inviting charities Stonewall and Mermaids to provide counselling services as she felt that they taught \"dangerous and contested extreme ideologies that don't have a basis in science\".\n\nCates has been a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee since March 2020 and the Education Select Committee since October 2021. She also co-chairs the Stocksbridge Towns Fund with local property developer Mark Dransfield.\n\nPersonal life\nCates lives in Oughtibridge, a village near Stocksbridge with her husband and three children. She is an evangelical Christian and met her husband while working on a voluntary project at their church in Sheffield.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Neil Gehrels\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cornelis A. \"Neil\" Gehrels (October 3, 1952 \u2013 February 6, 2017) was an American astrophysicist specializing in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nGehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.\n\nEarly life and education \nGehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up near several telescopes including living at McDonald Observatory before his family settled in Tucson, Arizona, when he was 14, where he attended high school and then the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard J. Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at GSFC as an astrophysicist. \n\nIn 1980 while in graduate school, he married fellow graduate student Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Gehrels passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 64 on February 6, 2017.\n\nCareer \nGehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991\u20132000), Mission scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernova and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes.\n\nHe was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.\n\nResearch\n\nOverview \nGehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation.\n\nGraduate studies \nGehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976\u20131979) and Edward C. Stone (1979\u20131981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions.\n\nBalloon Observations of SN 1987A \nAs a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions.\n\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory \nGehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma-ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g. Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels, et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources.\n\nSwift and Fermi observatories \nGehrels was the Principal investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernova, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events.\n\nFor Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions.\n\nWFIRST Era \nGehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide-field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated  Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel.\n\nOther scientific work \nWorking at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest:\n 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data\n 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge\n 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas\n 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble\n 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions\n 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae\n 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky\n\nAwards and honors \n 2017, Dan David Prize, astronomy (with Shrinivas Kulkarni and Andrzesj Udalski)\n 2016, Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award\n 2016, Milner Breakthrough Prize for LIGO gravitational wave discovery (Drever, Thorne, Weiss & LIGO Team)\n 2016, Physical Sciences Award, Washington Academy of Science\n 2016, Honorary Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society\n 2015, Asteroid 16000 Neilgehrels named in his honor\n 2012, Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n 2012, Alumnus of the Year, Honors College, University of Arizona\n 2012, Harrie Massey Award of COSPAR\n 2011, Member, International Academy of Astronautics\n 2010, Member, National Academy of Sciences\n 2009, George W.

This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.\n\nAnalysis\nGreece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.\n\nThe painting borrows elements from Christianity. Indeed, \"Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity. The blue coat and white robe, traditionally attributed to the Immaculate Conception, reinforces this analogy to a secular figure of Mary here.

Taking place during the Greek War of Independence, the painting depicts the Third Siege of Messolonghi, a pivotal event of the Greek struggle against the Ottoman Empire. The painting is considered a masterpiece of the neoclassical school of painting, and has become a symbol of Greek independence. It is displayed in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, in Paris. The painting measures 375.5 centimetres by 460.2 centimetres (almost 12 feet by 15 feet). The painting is a large-scale neoclassical composition set during a period of intense conflict in the early 19th century. Delacroix chose to focus on a single moment from the Third Siege of Missolonghi: the surrender of the Greek city to the Ottoman empire. The painting depicts a monk-like figure, wearing a white robe and a red hat, standing amidst the ruins of the city. He is raising his arm up in a gesture of defiance, while the figures around him are brought to tears and grief. The painting displays a range of emotions, from heroic defiance to sorrow and mourning, and is intended to be an expression of the courage and suffering of the Greeks during their War of Independence. In the foreground of the painting is a woman, kneeling with her arm raised, her face contorted in grief. She is flanked by a group of Greek citizens, young and old, visible in the bits and pieces of the city's ruins. Both the woman and the people around her represent the human cost of war and the futility of resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. The painting is a stirring homage to the courage of the Greek people and their struggle for independence. The painting has come to be seen as a symbol of the struggle for freedom and democracy which gave form to the modern Greek identity.

It is commonly used in theater, dance, mime, and other performance art genres such as clowning, street performance, and drag performance. Although white face is typically used to express uniformity and to emphasize the performer's eyes, mouth, and other facial features, some people also use white face to make a political or cultural statement. White face is a popular performance art dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. During these time periods, the white face was used to convey gender roles, with men wearing white make up to appear more masculine and women wearing it to appear more feminine. Some notable figures from the Theatre of Ancient Greece such as Thespis and Aeschylus also used white face as a means to convey expression, as noted in historical accounts such as the writings of Aristophanes. In the 20th century, theater groups such as the Moscow Art Theatre, founded by Konstantin Stanislavski and Viakislav Meyerhold, popularized the usage of white face. The two directors believed that performances were enhanced when the actor was able to convey emotion and expression through subtle shifts in facial expression, gesture, and vocal delivery. Today, white face is commonly used in theatre, dance, mime and other contemporary performance art genres. Professional clowns, street performers, and drag performers may also incorporate white face into their act. White face is usually paired with theatrical makeup in order to express an emotion or message. In many places, white face is discouraged due to its history of being associated with racism and White supremacy. Supporters of cultural appropriation argue that white face is an artistic form used to express emotions or ideas that should not be suppressed. Conversely, opponents of such appropriation argue that performers should not be able to appropriate a culture by using elements that are historically or traditionally associated with a culture they don't belong to. In most contemporary performance art, white face should not be used without permission, either from an audience or the performers themselves. Regardless of views on cultural appropriation, white face is a centuries old form of theatre that still has the potential to make powerful statements and elicit powerful emotions from audiences.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31134678}

She was the prima donna at London's Sadler's Wells Opera (English National Opera) through much of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nEarly life and career \nShe was born in Murrumbeena, a suburb of Melbourne. As a child, she had hoped to become a ballerina. However, she grew too big for this profession. She focussed instead on singing, taking vocal studies in Melbourne. Her operatic career began in 1950. In 1954, she sang Antonia in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann before Queen Elizabeth II who was on her first tour of Australia. In order to gain greater skill, she moved to London to study under the tenor Joseph Hislop who had also coached Jussi Bj\u00f6rling and Birgit Nilsson.\n\nAfter returning to Australia she quickly started to make a name for herself, taking soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, amongst others. It was while on an Australian national tour of Tosca that she had an extramarital affair with the Australian baritone Robert Simmons (they were later to marry), with whom she later had a son, John Simmons, now a Melbourne architect, and a daughter Geraldine 'Geri' Roggiero n\u00e9e Simmons now a Sydney wildlife artist.  This caused a scandal in 1950s Australia so she and Simmons headed for the United Kingdom.\n\nSadler's Wells\nOnce in Britain, Fretwell's first professional engagement was for Dublin's Grand Opera company.  Her performances there came to the attention of Sadler's Wells and in 1955 they engaged her services as principal soprano. It was at this point she became known as Elizabeth Fretwell. Sadler's was where Fretwell's finest performances were given, and she gained rave reviews. This was no small achievement given that at that time Maria Callas was dominant on the London opera stage. From the early 1960s to 1970 she went back and forth between Australia and the UK performing. In 1965 she gave her only performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in Aida and Il tabarro. She also performed with Scottish and Canadian companies and in North America.\n\nLater career and death\nIn 1969 Fretwell sang opposite Tito Gobbi in Falstaff, finally joining the ensemble of The Australian Opera in 1970.  During 1973 she sang in the opening season of the Sydney Opera House. She remained a member of the Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) until her retirement. In her later career, she took on smaller roles, to give up-and-coming singers there a chance to further their careers as principal singers.\n\nHer retirement was very low key; no one in the company knew of her impending retirement before she left. She did not want any fanfare or accolades at her last performance, and therefore only the management of the Australian Opera knew of her decision to retire in the late 1980s. She simply gave her last performance, then quietly went to her dressing room, packed up her makeup and personal belongings, and went home to her beloved house at Bayview, on the northern beaches of Sydney, and reverted to her married name of Betty Simmons.   She later served on the Opera Foundation's board for a number of years.\n \nShe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1977.  On 5 June 2006, she died suddenly at her Bayview home, from a ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm, aged 85.   She was survived by her son and daughter, and four grandchildren.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 births\n2006 deaths\nAustralian operatic sopranos\nSingers from Melbourne\nAustralian Officers of the Order of the British Empire\n20th-century Australian women opera singers", "machine_text": " Elizabeth Fretwell is an American businesswoman and philanthropist who has served on a number of corporate boards, including The American Heart Association, Microsoft, and The Business Roundtable.

The northern slope is not steep and is accessible via a range of routes.\n\nTourism \n\nThe main summit is often visited for its long-range view of the coast, through a winding path from the south. The path crosses several barriers, from grassy at the bottom, to rocky at the top. The path disappears in the depression between the last barrier and the southern slope of the main ridge to the east of the southern pillar, to reappear as a lateral ledge in the slope below the eastern ridge.\n\nThe entire massif apart from the southern wall is easily accessible, while the southern pillar of the main summit and the small northern wall of the western summit offer many short routes for climbers.\n\nVirtual Tour: You can take a virtual tour on the entire trail from start to the top, with full (360x360) panoramic images.\n\nReferences \n\nDavis Strait\nMountains of Greenland\nSisimiut", "machine_text": " Palasip Qaqqaa (also known as \"mixed boiled meats\" in English) is a traditional Inuit dish typically served on special occasions in the Circum-Arctic region. The dish consists of various meats, including caribou, seal, beluga and Arctic char, boiled in a mixture of water, salt and spices. The cuts of meat are arranged in the pot of water and cooked until the desired level of tenderness is achieved. Palasip Qaqqaa is typically served with special homemade bread called \"Qajaq\" and often accompanied by a variety of jams and fruit. The dish has been an important part of Inuit culture and tradition for centuries, and served, at times, as an important source of sustenance and nutrition in difficult years of food scarcity, when game and fish were scarce. Today, Palasip Qaqqaa is an integral part of many travel experiences in the Arctic, where hunters, fishermen and travelers often enjoy the dish when crossing the region. Many Inuit families still serve the dish for special occasions, usually for weddings and holidays. Furthermore, the dish is served in many restaurants across Canada and Alaska and provides a great opportunity for experiencing authentic Inuit cuisine. Due to its versatile nature and rich history, Palasip Qaqqaa is often used as an example of food sharing and traditional Inuit hospitality. It serves as a reminder of the hospitality and resilience of the Inuit people, who have managed to survive and thrive despite difficult environmental conditions and scarce resources. Palasip Qaqqaa is a unique example of cultural synchronism between Arctic cultures and a reminder of the importance of traditional knowledge and practices among Inuit communities. This dish is still very much alive within the Circum-Arctic region, representing a significant part of Inuit culture, history and identity.

It is based on the television series The Flintstones and is the first Flintstones video game.\n\nGameplay\nYabba Dabba Doo! is set before the marriage of Fred and Wilma Flintstone, during a time when the city of Bedrock was beginning to take shape. Playing as Fred, the player's goal is to build a house and persuade Wilma to move in with Fred, leading to their marriage. The player begins with a plot of land that is covered in small rocks, which must be carried off one at a time and dumped into a nearby pit. Enemies include pterodactyls that try to drop rocks on Fred's head, and turtles and dinosaurs which harm Fred directly. After clearing the rocks from the land, the player then searches Bedrock for boulders, which are used to build the house. Once the house is ready for a roof to be added, the player must get a job at a quarry in order to raise money to hire a dinosaur service, which will allow Fred to reach the top of the house. Throughout the game, Fred must meet with Wilma whenever he comes across her, in order to fill a heart meter which demonstrates her love for him. When the house is complete, the player must find Wilma and get her to follow Fred to the new house, which she will only do if the heart meter is full. Kissing Wilma is also the player's only way to refill the health bar.\n\nBedrock is represented through various screens. The player can move left and right to maneuver between screens located along the same path. Accessing upper and lower screens is done by moving diagonally towards the corner edge of each screen, rather than walking straight up or down. Located within Bedrock is Fred's car, which provides faster transportation between screens if it is found by the player. Buildings in Bedrock include a service station, a burger bar, a drive-in movie theater, and a health club, with the latter three locations being popular hangouts for Wilma. Fred's neighbors are building their own houses, and the player earns bonus points if Fred's house is finished before the others.\n\nReception\n\nThe Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were generally praised for their graphics, with Computer and Video Games (CVG) writing that Fred \"looks as if he's walked directly off the cartoon 'set' and into the computer game.\" However, some reviewers considered the graphics of the ZX Spectrum version to be poor. The game received criticism for the method used to move Fred diagonally between screens, which was considered difficult and confusing. Some critics believed the game would have particular appeal for fans of the television series, while others believed that the game lacked lasting appeal. CVG and Crash offered praise for the sound, although the latter also considered it sparse.\n\nComputer Gamer, in its review of the C64 version, praised the game's concept but considered the enemies too aggressive. The review criticized the lack of weapons to use against enemies, and stated that this along with Fred's \"awkward\" movements between screens \"contributed to spoil the whole game.\" In its review of the ZX Spectrum version, Computer Gamer stated that it had poor playability and was not as colorful as the C64 version, but that its enemies were less hostile.\n\nZzap!64 considered the game to be average and criticized its gameplay, while Commodore Horizons considered it fun. Your Commodore considered the game annoying, while ZX Computing stated that it lacked the fun and action of the television series. Your Sinclair considered it \"a very addictive game once you get the idea of what you're supposed to do.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Yabba Dabba Doo! at MobyGames\n\nVideo games based on The Flintstones\n1986 video games\nAmstrad CPC games\nCommodore 64 games\nZX Spectrum games\nEurope-exclusive video games\nSingle-player video games\nVideo games developed in the United Kingdom", "machine_text": " Yabba Dabba Doo! is an iconic catchphrase which originated in the American animated television series The Flintstones, the first major primetime animated series on television.

Oh Land wrote the song with the sole producer, Thomas Bartlett. It was digitally distributed as the third single from the album on 22 March 2019, through Tusk or Tooth Records. The song's release came with the announcement of new dates for her ongoing promotional Family Tree tour. It is an electronic song with a melancholic, piano and string-led production. Venezuelan-American singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart provides background vocals on the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Kiss in Songs\" detail Oh Land's desire to find someone who she can communicate with on a musical basis. It also serves as a reminder to Oh Land about what is important to her. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics, with some reviewers calling it beautiful and happy. Oh Land has since performed the song at the Koncerthuset in Copenhagen in September 2019.\n\nBackground and release \nAfter the release of Earth Sick (2014), her fourth studio album, Oh Land divided her time up for a number of side projects, including the recording of soundtracks Askepot (2016) and Watermusic (2018), and a cover of Denmark's national anthem for the 2018 television series The Rain. In 2018, she revealed to Rolling Stone that her then-upcoming album would be released in 2019 and was inspired by several recent events of her personal life, such as the divorce from her husband, her second pregnancy, and relocating back to Denmark. As she began songwriting sessions, Oh Land started to focus on relearning how to play the piano, which resulted in a sound and tonal shift for the album.\n\n\"Kiss in Songs\" was first announced to the public in a press release that stated it would be the third single from Family Tree. The song was released for digital download and streaming in Denmark and the United States on 22 March 2019, through Tusk or Tooth Records. The song's cover art uses an original, hand-embroidered design that was created by Danish artist Sarah Becker. \"Kiss in Songs\" served as the third single from Family Tree, following the releases of \"Human Error\" and \"Brief Moment\". The song's release came alongside the addition of more European tour dates for Oh Land's promotional Family Tree tour, which was first announced on 22 February 2019. On 3 May 2019, \"Kiss in Songs\" was included as the fourth track on Oh Land's fifth studio album Family Tree.\n\nIn the song's press release, Oh Land explained that it serves as a reminder for her as to why she makes music: \"I guess the whole reason I do music is that I express myself more clearly through melodies and singing.\" It was written by Oh Land and Thomas Bartlett, the latter of which solely produced the track. Oh Land received additional credits for creating the melody and lyrics for \"Kiss in Songs\". The song was mastered by UE Nastasi at Sterling Sound Studios in Edgewater, New Jersey. It was mixed by Patrick Dillett, while Peter Pejtsik served as the track's conductor.\n\nComposition and lyrics \n\nMusically, \"Kiss in Songs\" is a melancholic electronic song that is backed by piano and strings. Ole Rosenstand Svidt from Gaffa placed the song among the most ecclesiastical in Oh Land's discography. Of similar nature, Simon B\u00e6kgaard from SoundVenue described the song's melody as something one would associate with Sunday High mass. He also stated that the instrumental introduction reminded him of a hymn. \"Kiss in Songs\" is accompanied by a piano, played by Bartlett, who was also in charge of additional musical arrangements.\n\nAccording to its sheet music, \"Kiss in Songs\" is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of C major and it follows the setup of a verse, followed by chorus-verse-chorus and a post-chorus. Venezuelan-American singer-songwriter Devendra Banhart provides background vocals on the track.\n\nLyrically, \"Kiss in Songs\" features Oh Land describing how her potential love interest is able to communicate with her through music as opposed to just speaking. With the song, she attempts to \"forget [about] the ways we are used to using language\" and instead \"communicate on a more primal level\". Oh Land explained the overall meaning of \"Kiss in Songs\": \"In this song, I find someone who understands my language.\" In the song's chorus, Oh Land admits to her lover: \"And while history is written / And politics is spitten / We kiss in songs / And I'm missing you.\"\n\nReception and promotion \n\"Kiss in Songs\" was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. Svidt featured the song in his column of the week's 12 best new songs, for Gaffa, during the third week of March 2019. In his review, he called Oh Land's voice pleasant-sounding due to her shift towards a more organic creative direction. He also considered the song among Oh Land's other music that sounds magical. B\u00e6kgaard labelled the song beautiful and explained that it may contain some of the best chords he had heard in awhile. Emma Sejersen, a writer for Politiken, enjoyed the song, calling it one of the happiest-sounding tracks on Family Tree. Erin Vierra, from Mxdwn.com, also called \"Kiss in Songs\" a beautiful song, and said it \"lifts the listener up and refuses to let go\".\n\nIn September 2019, Oh Land performed a live show at Koncerthuset in Copenhagen. During the concert, she opened the night with a performance of \"Kiss in Songs\", followed by fellowalbum tracks \"Sunlight\" and \"Make My Trouble Beautiful\". Ivan Rod, a contributor to Gaffa, reviewed her performance and found that the aforementioned songs could have benefitted from being performed in a more intimate setting, due to their quiet nature. He wrote that although the songs were unable to meet the fullness of the performance space, they ended up being some of the highlights of Oh Land's show.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCredits and personnel \nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Family Tree.\n Nanna \u00d8land Fabriciuslyrics, melody, music\n Thomas Bartlettproduction, additional arrangements, piano\n Patrick Dillettmixing\n UE Nastasimastering\n Peter Pejtsikconductor\n Devendra Banhartbackground vocals\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences \n\nSongs about language\n2019 singles\n2019 songs\nElectronic songs\nOh Land songs\nSong recordings produced by Doveman\nSongs about music\nSongs written by Doveman\nSongs written by Oh Land", "machine_text": " Kiss in Songs is a broad and diverse genre of music, incorporating a number of different styles and subgenres. Kiss in Songs often focus on expressing emotions of love, passion, and romance through unique vocal and instrumental arrangements. Kiss in Songs traditionally express feelings of affection, longing, and devotion, and have been described as intimate, potent, and emotionally charged. Some of the earliest known kiss in songs can be traced back to ancient Greece. Greek poets and authors created many artful love poems and songs which often featured romantic kisses. These expressions of affection and love have inspired generations of writers and performers ever since. In the 20th and 21st centuries, kiss in songs have appeared in a variety of musical styles, from popular music and country ballads to classical, jazz, and opera. During this period, these songs have become increasingly popular in the mainstream, with different genres embracing and incorporating them. Pop music has been heavily influenced by kiss in songs and artists such as The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Taylor Swift have written some of the most enduring and beloved kiss in songs of all time. Kiss in songs often contain lyrics that describe intense physical love and longing, as well as abstract and poetic verses. Musically, they are typically composed with many different instruments and harmonies, though some jazz and classical pieces begin and end with just a solo piano. In recent years, kiss in songs have regained relevance in the mainstream music industry, and are increasingly being recorded by mainstream artists. This can be attributed to the increasing popularity of the romantic comedy genre, and its use of kiss in songs in featured scenes. Today, many popular love songs, particularly in the pop and R&B genres, feature dramatic kisses as a major or minor theme. Kiss in Songs are a timeless genre of music, with modern performers continuing to put their own spin on the classic themes. They are prominent in all sorts of romantic relationships and provide a unique way for lovers to express their feelings. Whether it be the classics from The Beatles or the latest from Taylor Swift, kiss in songs will remain relevant for many years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 60045353}

The gameplay is split between venturing into dungeons and spending time at the inn where players can build relationships with non-player characters or spend the money they have earned in the dungeons. A manga adaptation for Demon Gaze illustrated by Kurono began serialisation in Dengeki Maoh in December 2013. An international version of the game was released in Japan as Demon Gaze: Global Edition on July 3, 2014. An enhanced version of the game titled Demon Gaze EXTRA was released in September 2021 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in Japan with a western release set for January 2022.\n\nGameplay\nThe game takes place thousands of years after the events in Students of the Round. Players assume the role of the protagonist Oz, a mysterious young man with the power of a magic eye that grants him the ability to seal demons. The game allows players to create secondary characters that join him on his quest, with seven character classes and five different character races. There are 45 character illustrations altogether, which may be changed by \"taking a bath\". The demons in the game are part machine, and some of them can transform when they go on a rampage. After demons are defeated, the player is able to summon them to battle.\n\nOz journeys into the dungeons of Mislid to kill the demons and gather treasure before returning to town with his loot. Loot can then be used to pay rent at the local Dragon Princess inn or it can be spent to improve the player's party. Although battles take part in dungeons, the game's hub is set in a town where the player can rest and strengthen their party. While at the inn, players can rest or converse with the other non-player characters at the inn, including the manager Fran Pendor, who has a secret mission to offer the player. Certain conversations with non-player characters result in \"heart pounding\" cutscenes. Throughout the game, it is also possible to change the difficulty level, either in certain Dungeon Rooms or by talking with particular characters.\n\nSetting\nDemon Gaze is set in The World of Mythrid, which is divided into 6 regions: the castle of Grimodal, the Old City (Red and Blue), the Slave Graveyard, the Curtain of Star Trees and the Dragon Princess Inn.\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was released in Japan on January 24, 2013. Some of the monsters and items from the prequel, Students of the Round, are included in Demon Gaze, but the game features new dungeons and new half-machine demons as well. The game features many prominent Japanese voice actors including Saori Hayami, Atsuko Tanaka, and Yukari Tamura.\n\nSequel\nDevelopment of a sequel title began in mid-2014.

A July 2014 announcement by Kadokawa later confirmed a global shipment figure of 200,000 copies.\n\nDale North of Destructoid also gave the game 7/10, claiming Demon Gaze to be \"a solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\" Brittany Vincent of GamesRadar rewarded the game three stars out of five, summarising the game up as \"colorful, brash, and spunky, but it's little more than a wonky journey through dungeon after forgettable dungeon. If it's a grind you're looking for, you can do far better than the mediocrity of becoming a Demon Gazer.\" Heidi Kemps of GameSpot scored the game 7/10, finding the battles, dungeons and characters to be enjoyable, though the story, visual style and the heavy amount of fan service was criticised. Josiah Renaudin of IGN rated the game a 7.2/10, praising the combat and characters, but criticising the uninspired visuals and \"cookie-cutter premise.\" \n\nMarcus Estrada of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it \"a very mechanically sound dungeon crawler,\" and that \"the biggest hurdle to enjoying the game is simply your tastes for (or tolerance of) copious displays of fan service.\" Jim Sterling of The Escapist gave Demon Gaze a more positive review, as well as recommending the game, stating \"this is easily one of the more addictive ones I've enjoyed for a while, and it's perfect on Vita\", and scoring it 4.5/5. Nevertheless, Matt Kamen of The Guardian rated Demon Gaze much lower, giving the game only 2 stars out of 5, as \"Demon Gaze does make nice use of the Vita's online functions, allowing for notes left between players advising of secrets or dangers, but it's not enough to make up for a resoundingly lacklustre package.\"\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Official Japanese website, Archived on December 10, 2012\n Official North American website\n\n2013 video games\nNintendo Switch games\nPlayStation 4 games\nPlayStation Vita games\nKadokawa Shoten games\nKadokawa Dwango franchises\nVideo games developed in Japan\nRole-playing video games\nFantasy video games\nVideo games about demons\nFirst-person party-based dungeon crawler video games", "machine_text": " Demon Gaze is a dungeon crawler role-playing video game developed by Kadokawa Games, and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows.

Aurand, proprietors of the 'Montezuma Tent,' were attacked and Aurand killed by a group of Mexicans during the foreign miners tax excitement of that period. Due to the lack of water, little mining occurred here until 1852 when a ditch and flume were completed bringing water for placer mining. Two types of mining were carried on, placer operations on the flats and tunnels extending under Table Mountain. The gravel produced 3-1/2 C. per pan in the mid 50s. The yield was from $5 to $10 per day. One placer nugget found in 1853 weighed 18 lbs. 8 oz. By late 1852 the population was about 800. At its zenith Montezuma City had four saloons, two hotels, Adams Express Co., post office, church, some homes, and many tents and cabins. The town was nearly destroyed by an incendiary fire which started in Clarks Hotel on June 29, 1866.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks in Tuolumne County, California\n\nReferences\n\nUnincorporated communities in California\nUnincorporated communities in Solano County, California\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks", "machine_text": " Montezuma is a census-designated place in Colusa County, California.

It was named after the late Mexican leader Montezuma, however the exact reasoning why remains unclear. Montezuma is mostly an agricultural area, with a variety of crops being grown in the area including pears, olives, prunes, maize, and alfalfa. The surrounding terrain is mainly rolling hills and oak woodlands. The community has its own elementary school, which is part of the Colusa Unified School District, and the town has a post office. There are a few stores, churches, and other businesses in the town. The area is also home to Gray Lodge Wildlife Area, a 9,100-acre wildlife area owned by the State of California. The area shelters hundreds of species of birds and small animals, and is a popular bird-watching spot. It has flooded quite often in recent years due to the high water level of the nearby Sacramento River. Montezuma has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, with hot and dry summers, and wet and cool winters. The average July high temperature is 92 \u00b0F, and the average January low temperature of 38 \u00b0F. Annual precipitation is slightly more than 18 inches. The area has seen an increase in population in recent decades. This is partially due to the growth of rice, rice processing, and rice warehouse workers moving to the area and boosting the population. Montezuma is home to a few churches, a post office, a feed store, and other small businesses. There are a few Catholic churches located in the town, as well as many other Christian churches. Montezuma is a small, agricultural town located in California's Central Valley. It is an attractive place to live, with rolling hills, oak woodlands, and access to various waterfowl species.

She was primarily known for her work combining microscopy and paleontology to interpret the sedimentary rocks of the Appalachian region. Shear was born on August 21, 1837 in New York City. As a young woman, she became interested in mineralogy and geology. She was mentored in these fields by her uncle, Leonard Dwight, who was a professor of mineralogy at Yale College. From 1865 to 1870, Shear made trips to the Appalachia region to collect geological specimens. During this time she became acquainted with leading geological figures in the United States, including Louis Agassiz, George H. Cook, and Benjamin Silliman. In 1871, she married Thomas Shear, and the couple moved to Alabama to take up farming in his family. During this time, Shear continued to pursue her scientific career, studying the specimens collected from trips to the Appalachia region. She wrote several papers on Appalachian petrography and was among the earliest to apply scientific microscopy to rock and ore studies. In 1889, Shear became the first woman to be elected as a member of the Geological Society of America, and the following year she was admitted to the National Academy of Sciences. She was also appointed to the Geological Society of Washington, becoming its first women member. Through her studies of Appalachian sedimentary deposits, she contributed to the understanding of the biostratigraphy of the region, as well as the economic minerals found there. Shear also wrote numerous books, including A Text-Book of Mineralogy (1896) and A Dictionary of Minerals (1902). She spoke at a number of scientific meetings, presented numerous papers and lectures at universities, and was included in special volumes of scientific works such as Dictionary of American Biography.

He began his artistic training at the Verona Academy under Giovanni Caliari, and then studied at the Venice Academy from 1845 to 1847. An admirer of Giuseppe Mazzini, he became associated with the Young Italy movement and was taken prisoner while participating in the defense of Bologna in 1848. After his release he lived in Venice from 1849 until 1853.\n\nDuring the 1850s  Cabianca became acquainted with the artists, including Adriano Cecioni, Cristiano Banti, and Telemaco Signorini, who frequented the Caff\u00e8 Michelangiolo in Florence, who would be known as the Macchiaioli. He became a friend of Signorini, and travelled with Signorini and Banti to Paris. His friend's influence led Cabianca to turn away from  genre paintings towards a bolder realism, beginning in 1858. Like the other Macchiaioli, he painted landscapes en plein air, but he was more reluctant than his friends were to abandon historical and literary subjects.\n\nCabianca emphasized powerful value contrasts in his paintings. Cecioni described him as \"the most declared, violent and uninhibited macchiaiolo.\" Angelo de Gubernatis, who termed the Macchiaioli \"enemies of all conventionalism and accurate researchers of effects\", described Cabianca as principally interested in the effects of sunlight. Gottardo Garollo in his Dizionario Biografico describes Cabianca as a painter of the \"effects of the Sun\".\n\nMany of his paintings depict nuns; a well-known example is Le monachine (The nuns; 1861\u201362, Turin exhibition). Other works of the 1860s include La Mandriana and il Porcile al sole (1860). Returning from travels to Tuscany and Paris in 1864, he domiciled in Parma from 1864 to 1868, then moved to Rome.\n\nAmong his other works are Il bagno fra gli scogli; Sant'Angelo all' Isola di Giudecca; Reminiscenze del mare; Gondola bruna; La neve in Ciociaria; Le mura del convento; and Sotto il portico dei barattieri a Venice. At Naples in 1877, he exhibited Piccola via presso Perugia; La neve; Una casa ad Anacapri; and Reminiscenze d'Amalfi. At Rome in 1883 he displayed Rocca di Papa; Il caligo a Venice; Sul far del giorno; La pace del Chiostro; and Una sera sulla laguna.  He also painted in watercolors, including La neve a Venice, Il fait sa cour, and Sulla marina di Viareggio.\n\nThe works of Cabianca's later years show the influence of the Symbolists and the Pre-Raphaelites. He died in Rome on March 21, 1902.\n\nCollections holding works by Vincenzo Cabianca include the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome, and the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nSelected paintings\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBroude, Norma (1987).

He was born in Capri, Italy, in 1827 and by the age of 17 had already established himself as a successful sculptor and painter. He went on to create some of the most important works of the 19th century, and is most renowned for his expressionist landscapes. During his career, Cabianca was greatly influenced by the works of Perugino and its deep realism. He typically painted landscapes and rural scenes, however typical his style to include elements such as rural life, with an emphasis on dark greens and blues, a poetic representation of the earthy environment. His compositions often featured deep color harmonies and thick impasto paint application which helped capture mood and emotion. In 1863, he became a professor at the San Carlo Academy of Arts and Crafts in Naples, a position he held until 1876. At this time, he also served as the Capo Scultore of Rome, where he was responsible for overseeing arts projects and building restoration projects. During this decade he oversaw the restoration of famous monuments such as the Chiesa della Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti. Cabianca's most recognizable works are his depictions of the southern Italian landscape, which maintain a constant feeling of tranquility, soulfulness and solace. In addition, his architectural sculptures add an important dimension to Italian culture, creating landmarks in Italian cities and symbolizing historical events. After he retired from teaching art and architecture, Cabianca continued his artistic career by creating frescoes, lithographs, and other memorable artwork. He was also commissioned to create important sculptures for churches, monuments, and state halls. In the 1870s, Cabianca started to gain wealth, becoming an elite member of society. His social status and works were now recognized in the famous salon of Rome, with critics bestowing awards and public recognition. At the same time, his career shift towards social realism led to his formation of a cooperative of workers whom he employed to execute his marble sculptures. At the end of his life, Cabianca became an important figure in the Neapolitan landscape. Apparently, he was awarded with a public monument in his honor, located in Naples and bearing the neo-classicist insignia of the Napoleonic era. Cabianca\u2019s career reflects an important transition in 19th century Italian art, from the expressive power of romanticism to the symbolic meanings of modernism and the depths of artistic exploration. Many of his works remain on permanent exhibition in some of Italy\u2019s most influential art galleries.

The movie stars June Haver as Tammie Evans, a young farm girl who dreams of living a life outside the rural farmlands she finds herself living in. To accomplish her dream, Tammie disguises herself as a man named Slim and moves to a small town in California, where she gets a job at the local ranch and enters a singing contest in an effort to win the grand prize. Along the way, she meets a kind hearted rancher named Doc Wallace (Ray Collins) who helps her on her quest and ultimately serves as her love interest. The movie is based on a popular 1944 novel of the same name, written by Lillie Hayman, which was later adapted into a play by E.E. Church and the Broadway producer, Gilbert Miller. A Gal in Calico had its Broadway debut in 1945, and was produced by Miller until 1946. The movie was produced by Universal Pictures, and was a hit at the box office. Tammie Evans is a resourceful young girl who dreams of living in California and becoming a movie star. When her father's financial situation prevents her from attending college, she puts her plan into motion by disguising herself as a man and setting off for the golden state. Once in California, Tammie changes her name to Slim and gets a job on a ranch owned by Doc Wallace. As \"Slim,\" she enters an amateur talent contest, where the prize is a singing contract with the music hall conductor, Mr. Mason. While Mr. Mason is intrigued by Slim's powerful singing voice, he is unaware of her true identity. Much like the play and novel, the movie was a hit with fans of all ages. The charming story resonated at the box office, and the movie grossed $2.9 million. The movie was praised by critics, with Variety noting that it \u201cblends comedy with drama in an entertaining way.\u201d A Gal in Calico was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture, and was selected by the National Film Registry in 2001 to be preserved in the Library of Congress. The movie is remembered for its charming story, memorable music, and strong message about never giving up on your dreams, no matter what anyone else says. It also resonated with audiences because of its lead character, who represented the strength of young womanhood at the time. A Gal in Calico remains a popular classic to this day, and a favorite among musical fans who appreciate its timeless story.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5178981}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Morris Swadesh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Morris Swadesh (; January 22, 1909 \u2013 July 20, 1967) was an American linguist who specialized in comparative and historical linguistics.\n\nSwadesh was born in Massachusetts to Bessarabian Jewish immigrant parents. He completed bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, studying under Edward Sapir, and then followed Sapir to Yale University where he completed a Ph.D. in 1933. Swadesh taught at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison from 1937 to 1939, and then during World War II worked on projects with the United States Army and Office of Strategic Services. He became a professor at the City College of New York after the war's end, but was fired in 1949 due to his membership in the Communist Party. He spent most of the rest of his life teaching in Mexico and Canada.\n\nSwadesh had a particular interest in the indigenous languages of the Americas, and conducted extensive fieldwork throughout North America. He was one of the pioneers of glottochronology and lexicostatistics, and is known for his creation of the Swadesh list, a compilation of basic concepts believed to present across cultures and thus suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. Swadesh believed that his techniques could discover deep relationships between apparently unrelated languages, thus allowing for the identification of macrofamilies and possibly even a \"Proto-Human\" language. His theories were often controversial, and some have been deprecated by later linguists.\n\nEarly life and education\nSwadesh was born in 1909 in Holyoke, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bessarabia. His parents were multilingual, and he grew up with Yiddish, some Russian, and English as his first languages.\n\nSwadesh earned his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago, where he began studying with the linguist Edward Sapir. He followed Sapir to Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1933. Inspired by Sapir's early lists of word similarities among Native American languages, he began a life work in comparative linguistics.\n\nEarly career\nIn the 1930s, Swadesh conducted extensive fieldwork on more than 20 indigenous languages of the Americas, with travels in Canada, Mexico, and the US.  He worked most prominently on the Chitimacha language, a now-extinct language isolate found among indigenous people of Louisiana.  His fieldnotes and subsequent publications constitute the main source of information on this extinct language. He also conducted smaller amounts of fieldwork on the Menominee and Mahican languages, in Wisconsin and New York, respectively; both are part of the Algonquian language family.\n\nSwadesh taught linguistics and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison from 1937 to 1939. During this time he devised and organized the highly original \"Oneida Language and Folklore Project.\" This program hired more than a dozen Oneida Indians in Wisconsin for a WPA project (under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to record and translate texts in the Oneida language. (The Oneida were historically one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, with their historic territory located in central New York state, but some had moved to Wisconsin in the 19th century.) In this same period in other WPA projects, writers were recording state histories and guides, and researchers were collecting oral histories of African Americans who had been born into slavery before the end of the Civil War.\n\nSwadesh was let go by the University of Wisconsin just as he was to begin the project. Floyd Lounsbury, then an undergraduate, was assigned to finish it. Lounsbury continued his studies in linguistics, later serving as Sterling Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Yale University.\n\nIn May 1939 Swadesh went to Mexico, where he had been hired to assist the government of Mexican President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, who was promoting the education of indigenous peoples. Swadesh learned the Pur\u00e9pecha language for this work. Together with rural school teachers, Swadesh worked in indigenous villages, teaching people to read first in their own languages, before teaching them Spanish. He worked with the Tarahumara, Pur\u00e9pecha, and Otomi peoples. Swadesh also learned Spanish in less than a year; he was fluent enough that he was able to give a series of linguistics lectures (in Spanish) at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo and publish his first book, \"La Nueva Filologia,\" in Spanish in 1941. \n\nReturning to the U.S., during the Second World War Swadesh worked on military projects for the U.S. Army and the OSS to compile reference materials on Burmese, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish. He also wrote easy-to-learn textbooks for troops to learn Russian and Chinese.\n\nSwadesh served in Burma, where Lt. Roger Hilsman described his linguistic skills as extraordinary. Swadesh learned enough of the Naga language, after spending only one day with a local guide, that he was able to give a ten-minute thank-you speech in that language. Hilsman recalled that Swadesh had been strongly opposed to racial segregation in the United States.\n\nRed Scare\nIn May 1949, Swadesh was fired by the City College of New York (CCNY) due to accusations that he was a Communist. That was during the Red Scare, and he was one of a number of anthropologists and other academics to be opposed by anticommunists during the McCarthy Era. Swadesh had been a member of the Denver Communist Party and was active in the protest movement against the execution of convicted spies,  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Swadesh continued to work in the United States until 1954, aided by limited funding from the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia.\n\nLater career\nIn 1956 Swadesh returned to Mexico, where he took a position as researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and taught linguistics at the National School of Anthropology and History (Escuela Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia), in Mexico City.\n\nIn 1966, he was appointed Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Alberta in Canada. He was developing plans for a major research project in Western Canada at the time of his death, in the summer of 1967.\n\nWork in historical linguistics\nSwadesh is best known for his work in historical linguistics. Any language changes over centuries (consider, for example, the changes in English since the Middle Ages). Some languages diverge and become separate dialects, or languages that still belong to the same language family. Tracking similarities and differences between languages is part of historical linguistics.  Swadesh proposed a number of distant genetic links among languages.\n\nHe was the chief pioneer of lexicostatistics, which attempts to classify languages on the basis of the extent to which they have replaced basic words reconstructible in the proto-language, and glottochronology, which extends lexicostatistics by computing divergence dates from the lexical retention rate.\n\nSwadesh became a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized Interlingua and presented it to the public in 1951 (Esterhill 2000). In this role, he originated the lists of 100 and 200 basic vocabulary items, used (with some variation) in both lexicostatistics and glottochronology for comparison among languages. They have since been known as the Swadesh lists.\n\nSome scholars considered Swadesh as a supporter of monogenesis, the theory that all languages have a common origin: \"Swadesh sought to show that all the world's languages are related in one large family\" (Ruhlen 1994:215). Others believe that Swadesh proposed early linkages, but believed that languages diverged immediately among peoples, as he expressed in his major, but unfinished work, The Origin and Diversification of Language (1971), published posthumously.\n\nPersonal life\nSwadesh was married for a time to Mary Haas, a fellow American linguist. He later married Frances Leon, with whom he worked in Mexico in the 1930s; they divorced in the late 1950s.  He married linguist Evangelina Arana after his return to Mexico in 1956.\n\nHe died in Mexico City in July 1967.\n\nBibliography\n Swadesh, Morris (1932) The Expression of the Ending-Point Relation in English, French, and German.

He is widely recognized as the founder of glottochronology, a technique used to estimate the age of related languages. He is also well known for his development of basic word lists used to compare languages and track language divergence. Swadesh was born in the United States, in the now defunct town of Schoenmaker in Wisconsin. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1933, and completed his PhD in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1939. He was first appointed to the Institute for the Study of Man in 1940, where he eventually became the director of research. Swadesh's work pushed forward the field of historical linguistics. He developed the Swadesh List, or the 200 Basic Word List, as a method to compare related languages. Swadesh proposed that languages which shared more words were closer related and had diverged more recently. He also developed the glottochronology method, which allowed linguists to estimate the age of related languages by comparing the percentage of word retention over time. Swadesh also studied dialects and movements of American Indian peoples, particularly in the Great Plains areas. He studied the linguistic aspects of a number of American Indian tribes, gathering significant amounts of information on their languages, which provided an important contribution to Native American language studies. He also published important works on Proto-Iroquoian and Proto-Algonquian, as well as a number of other Algonquian and Iroquoian languages. Swadesh was a prolific writer, publishing a number of monographs and articles on a variety of theses in Native American language studies. He wrote on topics ranging from studies on Indian languages, specifically those from the Great Plains, to methods for the analysis of basic vocabulary and language divergence. He was also involved in formulating a number of language and lexicological studies for the International Institute of Comparative Linguistics.

The station is located at the intersection of Avenue De La Petite-Patrie and Avenue Van Horne and is connected to the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's campus. The station opened on April 28, 1966, as part of the original network of the Montreal Metro. Its architect, Victor Prus, used the specific design of \"arch\" type stations for the Universit\u00e9-de-Montr\u00e9al station. It has a central mezzanine beneath the tracks, serving both directions of the metro, and a single entrance/exit located outside the station on Avenue De La Petite-Patrie. The station is perhaps best known for its large public artwork, named Le lutrin, created in 1993 by Jan Ch je Ting Wong. The sculpture is a representation of a poet in front of a lectern and is made of bronze, granite and wood. It is made up of two pieces representing the artist's two Chinese ancestral symbols. The station of Universit\u00e9-de-Montr\u00e9al is located near several important attractions of the city, such as the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne-de-Champlain Park, \u00c9difice Polyvalente, and adjacent to the campus of Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Its direct access to the university makes it a frequently used station, especially during the summer months; students and holidaymakers use it to take advantage of the university's facilities and activities. The Universit\u00e9-de-Montr\u00e9al station is a popular and important station for tourists, as well as for local students, who depend on the metro to get to and from the university, or to explore the borough of Outremont. Nowadays, one of the main objectives of the STM's expansion plan consists of improving the access to the university, either by extending the current network \u2013 such as the Blue Line \u2013 or by developing new lines. Moreover, some safety initiatives have been implemented in recent years, such as the installation of extra cameras and the implementation of a security service.

He was one of the leading figures of the Czech avant-garde in the early 20th century, and one of the most influential Czech poets of the interwar period. Wolker was born into a Jewish middle-class family in the small town of Sedl\u010dany. As a student in Prague, he became involved in revolutionary activities; he was imprisoned for a year for his involvement in the The Workers\u2019 Sport International and the Young Czech Social-Democrats. This experience shaped his social and political views, which he expressed through his writing. Writing became his passion, and he wrote hundreds of poems, plays, and essays over the course of his short life. Wolker's best-known works include his poem \"The Ballad of Young He\u0159man\", which tells of a man who gives up his life in a fight against gendarmes to save his friend, and \"Thoughts on Life and Death\". He also wrote many plays, including The Provincial Robbers and The Knife Maker. His poetry was notable for its rhythmic, passionate expression of love, loss, and struggle. He was deeply influenced by the Czech folklore of his youth and by romanticism, but his works also echoed the disillusionment of the avant-garde; his themes were often dark and macabre. Though he achieved fame during his lifetime, he died in poverty in 1924 at the age of 28, having been struck by a deadly form of tuberculosis. His death, both tragic and untimely, caused a great shock in the Czech Literary community. Today, he is remembered as an inspiration to writers and poets, and as one of the most original figures of the Czech avant-garde. His writings continue to be influential in the Czech Republic, and in 2010 he was commemorated with an exhibition in Prague.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1407377}

The presence of the antigen on tumor cells has been associated with worse prognosis. In one study, high levels of MAGE-A3 in lung adenocarcinoma were associated with shorter survival.\n\nMAGE-A3 is a tumor-specific protein, and has been identified on many tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, hematologic malignancies, among others. Currently, GlaxoSmithKline is developing a cancer vaccine targeting MAGE-A3.

This gene codes for a cancer antigen, which belongs to the melanoma antigen family. It is most commonly found in melanomas and other skin disorders, as well as lung, ovarian, colorectal and renal cancers. It is known to play a role in skin cancer development, and more recently, has been linked to cancer metastasis. MAGEA3 functions as a tumor suppressor protein and acts as a transcriptional repressor of genes. This protein is essential for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and is involved in signal transduction pathways that control cellular growth and development. It is important for modulating the expression of other genes within the MAGEA family. The MAGEA3 gene belongs to the MAGEA gene family, which has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including melanomas, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, MAGEA3 has been linked to a number of other diseases, such as psoriasis, alopecia, and type-2 diabetes. Furthermore, its overexpression has been reported to be an important prognostic marker for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer patients. The protein encoded by MAGEA3 is an immunogenic antigen and is an important target for immunotherapy of cancer. The expression of the MAGEA3 gene is highly restricted to normal tissues and only present in low levels in healthy tissues. Its upregulation is found in up to 91% of melanomas. Recent studies have shown that MAGEA3 is important for cancer metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In addition to cancer, MAGEA3 has also been linked to autoimmunity. It is known to participate in the production of autoantibodies, which target the body\u2019s own tissues. MAGEA3 can serve as a target for immunotherapeutic strategies, such as monoclonal antibody therapy. Overall, MAGEA3 is an important cancer antigen that is involved in a variety of diseases and implicated in the development of cancer and autoimmunity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Facet (geometry)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In geometry, a facet is a feature of a polyhedron, polytope, or related geometric structure, generally of dimension one less than the structure itself. More specifically:\n In three-dimensional geometry, a facet of a polyhedron is any polygon whose corners are vertices of the polyhedron, and is not a face. To facet a polyhedron is to find and join such facets to form the faces of a new polyhedron; this is the reciprocal process to stellation and may also be applied to higher-dimensional polytopes.\n In polyhedral combinatorics and in the general theory of polytopes, a facet of a polytope of dimension n is a face that has dimension n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. Facets may also be called (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)-faces. In three-dimensional geometry, they are often called \"faces\" without qualification.\n A facet of a simplicial complex is a maximal simplex, that is a simplex that is not a face of another simplex of the complex. For (boundary complexes of) simplicial polytopes this coincides with the meaning from polyhedral combinatorics.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPolyhedra\nPolyhedral combinatorics\nPolytopes", "machine_text": " Facet (geometry) is a term used to describe the numerous flat faces or side surfaces of a three-dimensional object. It is alos referred to as a face, which can refer to either one of the side surfaces or to multiple side surfaces. Each of these facets of a polyhedron, or three-dimensional shape, serve as two-dimensional boundaries or molds of the three-dimensional shape. In Euclidean geometry, a facet of a polyhedron is defined as a piece of the surface that can be bounded by a single line or circle. The edges of the facets are also traditional lines or circles, depending on the shape of the polyhedron. In general, a facet must contain at least three edges, since fewer than three edges can only define a straight line and cannot bound a surface. The number of faces, or facets, a three-dimensional object has is related to the degree of rotation symmetry the object has. A cube, for example, has six faces since it is only able to rotate symmetrically in a full 90-degree increment. While a cube has six faces, it has twelve edges, and eight vertices. It is easy to tell that a shape is a cube or cuboid, as it is defined by its facets: each face is composed of squares, hence there are six facets and the shape itself will have an even number of degrees of symmetry (six). Other three-dimensional shapes such as cylinders, pyramids and cones, have a variety of facets and angles, and no two shapes have exactly the same number of facets. Faceted crystals, such as diamonds, are also known as gemstones, and these types of crystals are commonly prized for their aesthetic beauty. Faceted crystals often have many flat, smoothly polished faces which reflect light, a property which enables the gemstones to sparkle. Each of the faces of a faceted crystal is known as a 'facet', with different angles and sizes lending each crystal its individual and unique beauty. In the manufacturing industry, facets are also used as design elements. Facets in product designs can emphasize the underlying shape of the product, and are used to create streamlined or winding shapes. These shapes, however, are usually accomplished by machining rather than facet grinding as this allows for more precise angles and dimensions. Facet is a versatile word, which is not limited to Euclidean geometry, gemstones, and product design but is also used in computer science, economics and other fields. In computer science, for instance, the word facet can be used to describe characteristics of data, while in economics, facets of narrative or information can be used to describe the outcomes of a system or process.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7186647}

It is one of several languages of the Lombard subgroup of the Qiangic languages and is closely related to the Western Qiang, Aheu, and Angwang languages. Lashi is spoken by around 10,000 people in various towns and villages around the upper reaches of the Dadu and Yalong Rivers, mostly in Maoxian County and Litang County in Sichuan Province. It is also spoken in small numbers in the eastern part of Khams Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. It is currently not taught in schools and is not used for government or public purposes, but efforts are being made to document the language and preserve it for future generations. Lashi is a tonal language, with three tones corresponding to a low, high and rising tone. A distinguishing feature of the language is its \"wasi-wepo\" dual structures in its verb inflection. This involves making a distinction between pre-nasal and post-nasal consonants. There are also a number of monosyllabic and bisyllabic morphemes which form the basic structure of the language. The Lashi language does not have its own writing system, and when writing is used it is written using Chinese characters. An early proposal for a writing system using the Latin alphabet was presented in 1986, but it has not been adopted or used. Researchers have documented the Lashi language and developed pedagogical materials for the language, including books, grammar and dictionary courses, and audio and video recordings, for use by members of the Lashi ethnic group. There have also been efforts to standardize the language and create a Lashi-Chinese machine translation system. In May 2020, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) launched a five-year project to preserve and develop the Lashi language and culture, with the goal of creating a Lashi language \"Green Encyclopedia\" and other educational and cultural materials. Despite these efforts, the language is still under threat and research indicates that it will continue to decline in the near future. The lack of resources and support for language revitalization and preservation, combined with a low literacy rate among speakers, has led to a broad concern that the language and culture may eventually be lost.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Flag of Dorset\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The flag of Dorset (also known as the Dorset Cross, and Saint Wite's Cross) is the flag of the English county of Dorset. It was chosen as the flag of Dorset on 16 September 2008 following a vote open to all Dorset residents, and organised by Dorset County Council. The unitary authorities of Bournemouth (historically part of Hampshire) and Poole declined an invitation to participate. The flag has subsequently been registered at the Flag Institute and added to their UK Flags Register.\n\nHistory\nIn 2005 Dorset expatriate Stephen Coombs conceived a Dorset flag using white and red from the arms of Dorset County Council, using a simple cross design on a golden background. Dorchester resident David White joined the discussion in 2006 and created the very first version of the flag, but no serious attempt to raise the profile of the flag occurred at that time.\n\nIn 2007, an armorial banner of the Dorset County Council coat of arms appeared for commercial sale which prompted David White to raise the question of a flag for Dorset in the press. The council's initial response was to reject these calls saying it had no authority to create a flag as its administrative area was not the same as the county itself. \n\nIn early 2008, following discussions with Flag Institute member Jason Saber, an independent campaign led by David White began to promote the flag that Stephen Coombs and he had previously designed. Another campaign led by town criers Chris Brown, Jacqui Hall and Melvyn Gudger was promoting a different design at the same time, but decided to merge with White's campaign and continue promoting the Coombs/White flag.\n\nIn order to produce flags for the campaign and spread awareness, local businesses were offered the opportunity to sponsor production of the first 100 flags.\n\nIn April 2008 John Peake, the chairman of Dorset County Council, reversed the previous decision on a potential flag and asked the Dorset public to submit other ideas for a Dorset flag through the local press. Designs were submitted until the end of June 2008. \n\nDuring this time, Chris Brown persuaded the town of Wimborne Minster to adopt the Coombs/White flag regardless of the competition outcome.\n\nAlthough the Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities declined to participate in the event, council-sponsored voting took place from 12 August to 12 September and all residents of Dorset were eligible to vote. The Dorset Cross was announced as the winner on 16 September 2008 after receiving 54%(2086 votes) of the vote.\n\nSubsequent funding made from the campaign was given to local charities.\n\nIn November 2010, the flag was flown above HQ of the Department for Communities and Local Government in London. In an initiative by Eric Pickles MP, each of the nation's county flags were flown for a week to show their importance to the nation's heritage.\n\nThe flag featured quite prominently in the 2013 Dorset set TV series Broadchurch, which was in part filmed in West Bay.\n\nDorset based brewery Sunny Republic created an ale named 'Dorset Cross' after the flag.\n\nThe flag\nThe Dorset flag is made of three colours - red (pantone 186), white and gold (pantone 116). These colours are found in the arms (and supporters) of Dorset County Council. \n\nAlthough the gold in the flag was applied by Stephen Coombs in order to follow the rule of tincture, it was later suggested that to be more significant than originally thought: \n\nThe supporters of the arms of Dorset County Council are two golden dragons, representing Wessex, the ancient Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Dorset was at the heart of Wessex, which is said to have used a golden dragon as its emblem.\nDorset's agriculture. During spring, much of rural Dorset grows rapeseed, covering the county in fields of yellow. Dorset also grows wheat and barley.\nDorset's sandy beaches; particularly Weymouth and Bournemouth.\nGolden Cap, the highest point on the Jurassic Coast.\nGold Hill, the nationally famous street in Shaftesbury. \nThe Dorset militia and regiment used the colours gold, red and green. \nGold, red and white are also found in the flags of the Channel Islands Jersey and Guernsey, traditionally reached from England through Dorset ports.\n\nThe flag has also been linked to the name of St. Wite, a female Dorset saint who is buried at Whitchurch Canonicorum. An Anglo-Saxon holy woman, she is thought to have been martyred by invading Danes in the 9th century. It has been variously known as \"The Dorset Cross\", \"St Wite's Cross\" or simply \"The Dorset Flag\". David White expressed a preference for \"The Dorset Cross\", due to its more secular nature.\n\nThe official website of the flag is maintained by David White. Chris Brown proceeded to found the now defunct Dorset Flags For Good Causes group that sold flags to raise funds for Dorset-based good causes. This was eventually passed to the Dorset Community Foundation charity.\n\nArmorial banner\n\nThe armorial banner of the Dorset County Council coat of arms includes three red lions passant guardant with a red fleur de lys on a white background. Strictly speaking, the arms only represent Dorset County Council, rather than Dorset as a whole and officially, permission should be sought to use them.\n\nContenders\nThe original four final designs were selected by an independent judging panel and shortlisted for public voting. Voting began in August and ended on the 12 September 2008, although this was not held in the form of an officially constituted County referendum. 4090 votes were received, but 222 were discarded for various reasons. The other three contenders are shown below along with the explanations submitted by their designers:\n\nDesign A\n \nBlue is for the sky and sea; yellow for sun and sand; and green for the fields and countryside.\n108 votes.\n\nDesign C\n\nThe green background is synonymous with the county of Dorset and maintains our identity as a green and pleasant land. The yellow cross depicts the beautiful beaches we are fortunate to be blessed with. The oak leaf signifies the rural nature of this wonderful county, something most people living here are very proud of. The black border around the yellow cross signifies the black death that came to our shores and nearly wiped out the population but through our resilience as a people we overcame that threat and made us the proud people we are today.\n856 votes.\n\nDesign D\n\nThe colours on the flag should show all the good things we have in Dorset.

He was the second of three brothers. He grew up in Traer, Iowa, going on to attend Grinnell College and the US Military Academy at West Point, New York. He received his lieutenant's commission in 1891. He became athletic director at West Point for a short time in the early 1890s, managing the first Army football team.\n\nEarly service \nPierce first served in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 during the Invasion of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the resurrection of the Philippines. He served during the Boxer Rebellion in 1899. In 1901 he graduated from the Army War College and the school of the line and the staff class at Fort Leavenworth.\n\nPierce was the first president of the NCAA, taking office in 1906. At the first organizational meeting in December 1905, he emphasized the importance of \"home rule\", which allowed any institutions that joined the NCAA to still keep their independence. He was a severe critic of the \"old\" rules committee, saying that they were \"a self-constituted, self-perpetuating and irresponsible body, which, in order to make the rules more favorable to the playing area available at particular institutions, had degraded a once noble sport to a brutal gladitorial contest\".\n\nHe served in the Villa Expedition in 1916.\n\nService \n\nIn 1917, Pierce became an aide to United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. On one occasion after the declaration of war, when Pierce appeared before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss how to spend the three billion dollars requested to send to the War Department, he declared: \"Clothing, cots, camps, food, pay \u2026 And we may have to have an army in France!\". \"Good Lord!\" said Virginian Senator Thomas S. Martin. \"You're not going to send soldiers over there, are you?\" Pierce became the Director of Purchases for the War Industries Board after its establishment in 1917.\n\nIn the later half of 1917 to the early part of 1918, Pierce served as commander of the 27th Infantry Division and the 54th Infantry Regiment. While he was under British command, he was ordered to the Battle of Bellecourt; there the Australians provided invaluable supplies and lessons, including hot meals to the front lines, given the lack of supplies on the front line. In late 1918, he became the Assistant Chief of Staff of the AEF. He was promoted to brigadier general and earned two Distinguished Service Medal and the British Order of the Bath for his actions as the commander of the respective formations.\n\nDeath and legacy \nAfter retiring from the Army, Pierce became an assistant to the President of the Standard Oil Company. He died in New York City on January 17, 1940.\n\nHis widow, Agnes Young Pierce (1870-1961), left a bequest of $1 million to the Association of Graduates of West Point, which was used to establish the Palmer E.

Kreem, whom collaborated with Pandey for the soundtracks: Special 26 and Baby, refused his offer on his priorities with Baahubali: The Beginning (the first film in Rajamouli's Baahubali franchise) despite composing one promotional single, Pandey chose Amaal Malik for the film soundtrack and initially recorded six songs within March\u2014October 2015. No lip-syncing is used in the songs, as the team believed that the songs blend in the narrative. The album released in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi with the lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Chaitanya Prasad and Guru Thakur for the respective languages. Out of the seven songs, a promotional track \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" (also released in Tamil) and two alternate versions of the songs were used in Hindi version, while the Telugu and Marathi album have seven tracks.\n\nThe album opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Amaal Malik for using single soundscape and retaining the freshness and melody in the tracks, but criticised for the familiarity of the tunes. The tracks \"Besabriyaan\", \"Kaun Tujhe\", \"Phir Kabhi\" and \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" received the most consumer response and Palak Muchhal, the singer of \"Kaun Tujhe\" received a News18 and Screen Award for Best Female Playback Singer respectively.\n\nProduction \nInitially Neeraj Pandey planned to rope in M. M. Kreem as the composer for the film's soundtrack, after whom the director worked with him in Special 26 (2013) and Baby (2015). Kreem also composed the promotional track \"Phir Se\" written by Manoj Muntashir and recorded by Divya Kumar, for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Indian cricket team. Pandey being a cricket buff said that the idea was \"to sum up the mood and emotion for the entire nation\" and called the song as a \"tribute to the inherent passion our players have for the country and the love we have towards our own team\". Both the director and the composer worked on the song and video in short span of time so as to release the track before the tournament which begins on 14 February 2015. The song received overwhelmingly positive response and Pandey eventually planned to rope Kreem as the composer. But, Kreem's commitments on Baahubali franchise led Pandey to choose a different composer for the songs. When Pandey listened to the song \"Sooraj Dooba Hain\" from the film Roy (2015), Pandey eventually approached the composer of the song, Amaal Malik to work for the biopic's songs along with Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series. Malik had eventually composed two single songs for the label \u2014  \"Chal Wahan Jaate Hain\" and \"Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main\" \u2014 both of them featured Tiger Shroff as the lead.\n\nAmaal Malik composed 25 songs in his film career when he was being a part of multi-composer soundtracks for films, but this was his first album as a solo composer. Initially, the team had planned for a multi-composer setup for the songs in the film, but as Amaal Malik composed the first track \"Besabriyaan\", the team decided to retain him as the composer for the soundtrack. Within October 2015, Malik finished composing six tracks for the film's soundtrack with three of them being romantic numbers which highlighted Dhoni's relationship with his wife Sakshi Dhoni, from the time they first meet to post marriage. Bhushan made Malik sit for nights explaining him the feel and requirement of each song in the film. The album does not have the characters lip-syncing to the songs but will play in the background as they wanted the score to complement the cricketer's image and the album was further recorded with live instruments.\n\nMalik said that the seven songs have \"fine blend of rock and orchestral elements\". He explained that \"The album maintains a balance between commercial and the inspirational aspect, even if one has not seen the movie, they would still be able to relate to the songs, which is why the songs work as stand-alone tracks\"; also adding that the album maintains a single sort of soundscape, which he called as the \"most difficult to crack\", calling the film as \"one of his toughest projects in his career\".\n\nAlbum information \nThe track \"Besabriyaan\" which was the first to be composed which is about Dhoni's early life that how he juggled between studies and cricket simultaneously. The second song \"Kaun Tujhe\" is about the relationship with his late girlfriend Priyanka Jha, who died in a tragic accident in 2002. The third song from the film entitled \"Jab Tak\" is about Dhoni's first meeting with his wife Sakshi in the film. Rochak Kohli was announced as the guest composer for the film's soundtrack and composed a promotional single titled \"Har Gully Mein Dhoni Hai\" which is about the craze of cricket in India and public opinion about the sport. It was initially started as the theme of street cricket in India, but Kohli described the song as \"a tribute to dreams and the fight to achieve the dreams\". He further described the song as \"a metaphor for everyone in India who has the potential to rise above their immediate realities to achieve them\" and as \"an emotional song that connects to everyone, in every by-lane of the country, with the hope and passion to succeed\". This song was released in Tamil as \"Ulagam Engum Dhoni Ye\" sung by S. P. Charan and lyrics written by Pa. Vijay. However, it was not featured in the Telugu and Marathi versions of the soundtracks. The promotional song \"Phir Se\" which was made by M. M. Kreem for the 2015 Cricket World Cup was not included in the film.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Times of India, Rinky Kumar gave the soundtrack album a rating 3 out of 5 adding: \"the album has a mixed bag of tracks, some of which make quite an impression and while others are nothing to write home about\". Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi also rated 3 out of 5, calling the album as \"quite decent\" and praised Amaal Malik for a \"great effort in his first solo album\". Writing for India Today, Devarsi Ghosh added that: \"the album has a few stock market-friendly hit-gaana type numbers, every once in a while, Amaal tries to move away from monotony and do something interesting\". Critic based at Daily News and Analysis praised Amaal Malik for the use of live instruments in the film's soundtrack, calling it as \"a more full-blooded feel\", and further added that \"the album has a couple of snags, but that could not stop the album's winning inning\".\n\nJoginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 4.5 out of 5 saying \"The music of M.S. Dhoni is good and there is nothing unlikeable about it. Though one doesn't expect the music to become chartbuster from a long term musical experience, in the context of the film most of them should fit in well.\" Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave a 4 out of 5 rating to the soundtrack saying \"Amaal Mallik makes his mark as a solo music director\". A critic from India.com said that \"there is some not-so-wow kind of songs too, but the album will still be liked \u2013 thanks to the soft romantic tracks\". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in called that \"Mallik has a hit strike rate with the mushy numbers, but he has his work cut out for him if he wants to diversify into other styles\". Critic Gaurang Chauhan of BollywoodLife.com said that the album has \"quite a few hummable tunes to it\" and called the album as a \"must listen for all the romantic hearts\". A critic from Behindwoods gave the album 3 out of 5 calling it as \"an impressive album which stays perfectly true to the film's genre\". Vipin Nair of Music Aloud criticised the soundtrack saying it as \"the album is largely marred by the familiarity in its tunes\", with a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Megha Mathur of The Quint opined that \"Amaal Mallik's compositions are not as dynamic or disruptive as the film's protagonist, despite few long lasting melodies\". She further called that \"The OST falls short of making the biopic a spectacular experience\".\n\nTrack listing\n\nHindi\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nMarathi\n\nRelease history\n\nChart performance \n\n Weekly charts\n\n Year-end charts\n\nAccolades\n\nPersonnel \nCredits adapted from CD liner notes\n\n Amaal Mallik \u2013 Composer (All tracks), musical arrangements (All tracks)\n Meghdeep Bose \u2013 Music producer (Track 1,2,3,10), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,10)\n Sourav Roy \u2013 Music producer (Track 4)\n Keshav Dhar \u2013 Music producer (Track 5), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Ankur Mukherjee \u2013 Music producer (Track 5), acoustic guitar (Track 1,2,6,10), live guitar (Track 4), ukulele (Track 4)\n Jim Sathya \u2013 Music producer (Track 6)\n Aditya Dev \u2013 Music producer (Track 7)\n Rochak Kohli \u2013 Music producer (Track 8)\n Joell Mukherji \u2013 Music producer (Track 9), acoustic guitar (Track 9), electric guitar (Track 9)\n Armaan Malik \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 4), electric guitar (Track 5)\n Dev Arijit \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Mohit Dogra \u2013 Acoustic guitar (Track 8)\n Rushad Mistry \u2013 Bass guitar (Track 1,6)\n Jeeni Dutta \u2013 Electric guitar (Track 5)\n Jai Row Kavi \u2013 Drums (Track 5)\n Sivamani \u2013 Drums (Track 8), percussions (Track 8)\n Firoz Khan \u2013 Keys (Track 8)\n Krishna Jhaveri \u2013 Bass (Track 5)\n Omkar Dhumal \u2013 Shehnai (Track 7)\n Tejas Vinchurkar \u2013 Flute (Track 1,2,10), Woodwinds (Track 1)\n Suresh Lalwani \u2013 Strings (CMA Musicians, Mumbai) [Track 1,3]\n Dipesh Varma \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Daboo Malik \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7), live percussions (Track 7)\n Omkar Salunkhe \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Keyur Barve \u2013 Live rhythm (Track 7)\n Amey Londhe \u2013 Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Vincent Joseph \u2013 Vocal recording (Audio Garage, Mumbai) [Track 1,5]\n Surajit Ghoshmazumdar \u2013 Vocal recording (T-Series Studios, Mumbai) [Track 2]\n Rahul Sharma \u2013 Vocal recording (Asia Music Vision, Mumbai) [Track 4]\n Akshay Kamat \u2013 Vocal recording (RK Music Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], music assistance\n Vijay Dayal \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Chinmay Mestry \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,2,6,10], vocal recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 3,6,10]\n Shantanu Hudlikar \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Abhishek Khandelwal \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Manasi Tare \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (YRF Studios, Mumbai) [Track 1,3,5]\n Julian Mascarenhas \u2013 Live instrumentation recording (Enzy Studios, Mumbai) [Track 4,8]\n Eric Pillai \u2013 Audio mixing (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks], mastering (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai) [All tracks]\n Bharat Goel \u2013 Audio mixing (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8], mastering (Global Sound Labs, Mumbai) [Track 8]\n Ninad Lad \u2013 Audio mixing (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9], live instrumentation recording (Orbis Studio, Mumbai) [Track 9]\n Donal Whelan \u2013 Audio mastering (Mastering World, London) [Track 9]\n Michael Edwin Pillai \u2013 Mixing assistance (Future Sound of Bombay, Mumbai)\n Shayan Chakraborty \u2013 Mixing assistance (Orbis Studio, Mumbai)\n Krish Trivedi \u2013 Music assistance\n Sid 'Sky' Singh \u2013 Music assistance\n Yash Narvekar \u2013 Music assistance\n Zaid Patni \u2013 Music assistance\n Shishir A Samant \u2013 Music assistance\n Gaurav Sanghvi \u2013 Music assistance\n Anvay Patil \u2013 Music assistance\n Rujul Deolikar \u2013 Music assistance\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n2016 soundtrack albums\nHindi film soundtracks\nTamil film soundtracks\nTelugu film soundtracks\nT-Series (company) soundtrack albums\nSports film soundtracks\nBiographical film soundtracks", "machine_text": " M.S.

Its name derives from Dayton Street, one of Flint's most crime-ridden streets.\n\nMusical career\n\nEarly history (1993\u20132005)\nIn 1993, Ira Dorsey and Raheen Peterson met through their younger brothers. The two began writing together, under the names Bootleg and Shoestring, and created their first song, \"Dope Dayton Ave\". Rapper Matt Hinkle soon joined the duo under the name Backstabba. The group began working with local producer Steve Pitts and formed The Dayton Family, named after Dayton Avenue, one of the most crime-ridden streets in their hometown of Flint, Michigan. In between studio sessions, they performed at local clubs and quickly gain notoriety within Flint.\n\nThe Dayton Family recorded a 12-inch single and soon signed with Atlanta independent record label Po' Broke in 1995. That year, the group released their debut album What's on My Mind? and were featured on No Limits Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin' compilation album, which got the trio recognition throughout Southern United States. After the album's release, Hinkle was imprisoned and replaced by Bootleg's younger brother Erick, who performed under the name Ghetto-E. Following a year of touring, the group left Po' Broke due to legal problems with the label's producer and signed with Russ Entertainment .\n\nIn 1996, they released their second album F.B.I., standing for Fuck Being Indicted, under Russ Entertainment/Relativity Records. The Dayton Family was plagued with various legal problems, including Ira being incarcerated soon after release of F.B.I., which hindered the amount of work the group released. In 1999, both Ira and Peterson released solo albums. Two years later, the group signed with Detroit rapper Esham's Gothom label and released solo albums. The next year, they released Welcome to the Dopehouse under Koch Records.\n\nStabilization (2005-2010)\nAfter a three-year hiatus, the group was trimmed down to Ira and Peterson and they released Family Feud through Fast Life Records. The following year, The Dayton Family signed with U Be U Records and released Back on Dayton Ave. The duo added new member Jake the Flake later that same year and released Return to Dayton Ave. in October. Following Hinkle's release from prison, the group returned to their original lineup of Ira, Peterson, and Hinkle. In 2009, they released The Return: The Right to Remain Silent under DDA Records.\n\nHatchet House (2010-2011)\nOn July 14, 2010, The Dayton Family signed with Insane Clown Posse's subsidiary label Hatchet House. The group released the EP Psycho on February 1, 2011, and a music video was released for the song \"Cocaine\" on 28 March. Their seventh album, Charges of Indictment, was released on June 28. They most recently featured in the \"Psychopathic Psypher\" Part 1 & 2 (Bootleg in Part 1 and Shoestring in Part 2). The video for \"The Psypher (Part 1 & 2)\" was released on June 5, 2011.\n\nStyle and influences\nThe Dayton Family is known for their gritty lyrics concerning ghetto survival, struggle and poverty. AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier describes The Dayton Family's musical style as \"potent hardcore rap\". He says that the group has \"an idiosyncratic identity\" and \"a dark, grim mentality focused on modest survival rather than riches or fame\". The group lists Run-DMC, Michael Jackson, LL Cool J, N.W.A, Geto Boys, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., X-Clan, Spice 1, Esham, Natas and Public Enemy as influences.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nExtended plays\n\nSolo albums\nBootleg\n1999: Death Before Dishonesty\n2001: Hated By Many, Loved By Few\n2005: The Product\n2009: I Declare War\n2016: Problems EP\n2016: Street Related\n2018: The Transplant\n2019: 93ID\nGhetto E\n2001: Ghetto Theater\nShoestring\n1999: Representin' Till The World Ends\n2001: Cross Addicted\n2016: Fix My City\n2017: Black Friday\n2019: The Bake Up Boy\nJake the Flake\n1992: Out 2 Get Rich EP\n1996: Flint Thug Compilation\n1998: Out 2 Get Rich: The Album\n1998: & The Flint Thugs\n1998: Streets Is All I Know\n1999: Mr. Jakafella Volume 1\n2009: Uncut Raw\n2015: Legendary Mixtape (Hosted By Mike Epps)\n2015: Game Is Meant To Be Sold (The Soundtrack)\n2019: Gloves Off\n2020: God Forgive Me\n\nGuest appearances\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAfrican-American musical groups\nAmerican hip hop groups\nHatchet House artists\nMusical groups from Flint, Michigan\nMusical groups established in 1993\nReel Life Productions artists\n1993 establishments in Michigan\nGangsta rap groups\nHorrorcore groups", "machine_text": " The Dayton Family is a rap duo from Flint, Michigan.

The building was demolished and relocated in 1914 to a corner site of King Street and Batman Street. \n\nThe parish is led by the Reverend Canon Matthew Williams. The Senior Associate Minister is the Reverend Mike Raiter, who is also director of the Centre for Biblical Preaching. The Assistant Curate is The Reverend Jessica Naylor-Tatterson.\n\nThe parish is served each Sunday by The Old Cathedral Voices, a semi-professional all-scholar consort choir which sings music from the Renaissance era to contemporary anthems, including regular new commissions and premieres. The organist is David Brown.\n\nMore recently, the church has begun serving as the chapel for Haileybury College's City Campus.\n\nThe building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\nHistory\nMelbourne's first substantial church was the 'Pioneer Church', a simple wooden structure used for both Anglican and Presbyterian services and as a school, which stood on the corner of William and Little Collins streets. \n\nThe  foundation stone for St James was laid on 9 November 1839 by Charles La Trobe, the superintendent of the Port Phillip District (now the state of Victoria), in what was then still part of New South Wales. Melbourne was then only four years old and the church was one of the first substantial buildings to be built in the town. The church was designed by the town surveyor, Robert Russell, and built by George Beaver. One of the founders of Melbourne, John Batman, was among the subscribers who paid for the church's construction. The unfinished building was opened for worship on 2 October 1842, and it was finally completed in 1847. In 1848 Melbourne became an Anglican diocese and St James' became the cathedral church of the first Bishop of Melbourne, Charles Perry who appointed Hussey Burgh Macartney as the inaugural Dean. Macartney's wife, Jane Macartney (Hardman) and Frances Perry, wife of the Bishop, established and managed various charitable institutions in Melbourne. St James served as Melbourne's Anglican cathedral until St Paul's Cathedral was consecrated in 1891.\n\nRelocation\nThe church originally stood near the corner of Collins Street and William Street in what was the centre of the town in the 1840s, at what is now the western end of the business district. There is still a small street called St James Lane, which ran adjacent to the church's school on the next block to the north. In May 1913 leaks and cracks led to an inspection by architect Thomas Watts which determined that the structure was unsafe and had to be closed. With rising land values and a declining congregation, the possibility of re-erecting rather than demolishing was proposed, and a site not very far away on the corner of King Street and Batman Street opposite the Flagstaff Gardens was chosen. The move was overseen by John Stevens Gawler, a Melbourne architect who was largely responsible for establishing the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne, and it was reopened on Sunday April 19th, 1914.  Essentially only the exterior stonework and the timber work was saved, and the church was not rebuilt precisely the same, with; there were also a number of minor internal changes, reorientation from east west to north south, and changes to the tower - the third stage of the tower was made square to match the base rather than octagonal to match to the top section, both square stages have two arches instead of three, and are taller, and the dome is flatter, altogether creating a taller square tower, rather than the previous narrow octagonal one. Despite the relocation and reconstruction, the church is listed as \"the earliest surviving church in Victoria, and one of Melbourne's earliest surviving buildings\".\n\nSee also\nList of cathedrals in Australia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nChurches completed in 1849\n19th-century Anglican church buildings\nAnglican church buildings in Melbourne\nRelocated buildings and structures\n1842 establishments in Australia\nCathedrals in Victoria (Australia)\nCathedrals in Melbourne", "machine_text": " St James Old Cathedral is an historic 19th century church located in Melbourne, Australia. It is located on the corner of Collins and William Streets, within the quieter parts of the city, adjacent to Little Bourke Street. The church is often seen as one of the oldest of its time in the area and an important symbol of the city's colonial history. St James Old Cathedral is an Anglican church part of the parish of St James, which is incorporated as part of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne. The church was built in 1849, when the area was still settlement was on the outskirts of Melbourne, the church is built in a form of Victorian Gothic Revival and was meant to represent the increasing wealth and prosperity of the growing colony. The building has been described by historians as \u2018one of the most impressive examples of 19th-century architecture in Victoria\u2019. The St James Old Cathedral has undergone a number of changes throughout its life. The first major change was in 1861 when the church\u2019s chancel was extended and the spire was added by William Wardell and his assistants to the west side of the church. In 1884 a major renovation was undertaken to add external tower pinnacles and a vestry on the north side of the church. Internal renovations were also undertaken in the 20th century a full restoration project to commemorate the centenary of the church finished. The Gothic Revival is still evident within the interior designed in shades of crimson and gold. The archways, columns and ceilings are still decorated with the detail typical of the period. Inside the octagonal ceiling has a central rose made of stained glass. The altar includes a marble base and a marble communion table with carvings of Gothic symbols. The church remains popular amongst couples seeking to marry, with weddings both civil and Anglican ceremonies able to be held. A range of other religious events still take place within the grounds, such as the Sunday church services, Sunday school classes and midweek Bible Study. The church is also visited by tourists interested in understanding the history of the area and St James Old Cathedral itself.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3209758}

It was taken into account most international water legislation requirements.\n\nHistory \nIn the late 80's and early  there was a serious problem in the water supply system in Azerbaijan. After the gaining of independence, the main task of government was to eliminate the difficulties in the water supply system as well as in many areas of the economy. First of all, the establishment of an organization that could improve the drinking water supply of residential settlements in Baku, Sumgayit and Absheron peninsula began. So, the Absheron Regional Joint Stock Water Company was created in 1995, under the decision of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan based on the main and circulating assets of the two former state-owned enterprises - \"Kommunsenayesutehjizaty\" Production Association and \"AzSuGEO\" Scientific-Research Institute.\n\nAt that period of time, for the first time among the CIS, a loan was granted to the water sector by international financial institutions for the \"Greater Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project\"  and this project was successfully implemented.\n\nDrinking water supply \n\nIn 2004, the repartition of water resources in Azerbaijan is as follow: 30% rivers, 40% lakes, 20% reservoirs and the rest between springs and groundwater. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in 2008 7% of the consumed water in Azerbaidjan was coming from underground sources.\n\nMingachevir reservoir of the Kura river is used as a source of drinking water by the population.\n\nReservoirs\n\nMingachevir reservoir \nThis Mingachevir water reservoir was created on the Kura river. The construction of the Mingachevir reservoir and the Hydroelectric Power Station was completed in 1953. The total capacity of the reservoir at the normal level (83 m) is 15730 mln m3, useful volume of it is 8210 mln m3. The area of the reservoir is 605\u00a0km2, the volume is 16.1\u00a0km3, the length is 70\u00a0km, the maximum width is 18\u00a0km, the average depth is 26 m, the deepest is 75 m.\n\nJeyranbatan reservoir \nJeyranbatan water reservoir was established in 1955 due to increasing demand for drinking and technical water in Baku and Sumgayit. The capacity of the reservoir is 186 million m3, the useful volume is 150 mln m3. The length of the reservoir is 8.74\u00a0km, the maximum width is 2.15\u00a0km, the length of the coastline is 23.3\u00a0km, the maximum depth is 28.5 meters.\n\nSanitation \nIn the sewerage sector, Baku wastewater network serves 72% population of the city, but only 50% of the water is treated. 90% of the treated water is biologically processed and only 10% is mechanically processed. Wastewater treatment plants are available in 16 cities and regions; most of them are partially or completely useless. In most cases, the quality of water supplied to the population does not meet the required standards. The state works with donor communities to take the necessary measures to address these problems. The Azerbaijani government has adopted a program on the construction of water supply and sewage systems in more than 60 small towns (regional centers) in the country.  The state has already started to implement more than 20 such projects.  At the same time, local water supply projects are being implemented.\n\n\"Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project\" \nThe Loan agreement between the Government of Azerbaijan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency on the \"Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \" was signed on 29 May 2009 and entered into force on 30 June 2009. The project covers rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation systems in Gusar, Khachmaz, Khizi, Gobustan and Naftalan.\n\nGusar City \n\"The project on rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation system of Gusar town\" has been calculated to improve drinking water and sanitation services of 19,600 people in Gusar city, taking into account perspective development until 2030. Within the project, drinking water supply will be improved in 12,000 people living in Balakusar, Hasanqala, Old Khudat, Chilagir, Yukhari Layar, Gayakend, Khuray villages of Gusar region and Chartepe, Orta Khuch, Ashagi Khuch villages of Guba region.\n\nConstruction and installation works on the project started on April 19, 2012. At the first stage of the project, a drainage water facility with a capacity of 102 liters per day or 8800 cubic meters per day was constructed in Gusarchay river to provide Gusar and its surrounding villages with drinking water. At the same time, three water reservoirs with a total capacity of 1,000 cubic meters, a 2.8\u00a0km long inter-reservoir water line and a new water chlorinating building were constructed.\n\nKhachmaz City \nImplementation of the project on rehabilitation of drinking water supply and sanitation systems of Khachmaz city started on 19 April 2012. The project has been calculated to improve drinking water and sanitation services of 47,000 people in Khachmaz, the water supply of 11,000 people in Qobuqyagi, Armudpadar, Garaychi, Garagurdlu and Old Khachmaz villages of the region.\n\nIn the first stage of the project, the Uchkun spring, (which is the main water source of the city) was rehabilitated, 2\u00a0km long trunk water line (400\u00a0mm) was constructed, 2 reservoirs with a total capacity of 10,000 cubic meters were built and 1,6\u00a0km water line between this reservoirs was constructed.\n\nKhizi City \nConstruction and installation works on the project started in 2012 and at the first stage of project, water intake facilities were built in Gars (430 cubic meters / day) and Yeddibulag (40 cubic meters / day) resources, and an 8.4\u00a0km long trunk water line was constructed in Khizi.\n\nNaftalan city \nImplementation of the project for reconstruction of drinking water supply and sewerage system of Naftalan city started in early 2013.\n\nGobustan City \nA groundbreaking ceremony for reconstruction of Gobustan drinking water supply and sanitation system was held on May 10, 2015.\n\nWater use\nAccording to FAO's report, the major part of the water in Azerbaijan is used for agriculture and livestock (77%), the rest is shared between industry (19%) and municipalities (4%) as of 2005.\n\n\"Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Services\" project \nFinancing agreement on the project \"Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Services\" have been signed between Azerbaijan and World Bank on September 5, 2008.\n\nWithin the project, reconstruction of water supply and sanitation systems and facilities in 21 regions of the country (Devechi, Dashkasan, Gadabay, Imishli, Kurdamir, Siyazan, Agsu, Ismayilli, Ujar, Zardab, Lankaran, Masalli, Astara, Jalilabad, Yardimli, Lerik and also in 5 districts of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic - Julfa, Ordubad, Sadarak, Kangarli, Shahbuz) was planned.\n\nThe total cost of the project is $410.0 million. $260.0 million of this amount was financed by loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association, and US$150.0 million was funded by the Government of Azerbaijan.\n\nSee also \n\n Utilities in Azerbaijan\n Jeyranbatan Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plants Complex\n Jeyranbatan reservoir\nAzersu Open Joint Stock Company\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Groundwater of Azerbaidjan, Prof.Dr. Adishirin B.Alakbarov\n\nEconomy of Azerbaijan\nBodies of water of Azerbaijan", "machine_text": " Water supply and sanitation in Azerbaijan is the responsibility of the State Agency for Town Building and Communications, which is under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. Water supply and sanitation services in Azerbaijan remain inadequate and poorly managed in terms of service level and efficiency. Azerbaijan has accessible surface water and groundwater, but approximately two-thirds of the rural population is without access to safe water. Most water resources are polluted, and water and sanitation services generally do not meet the public health standard. The government of Azerbaijan has implemented various reforms to improve the water supply services in the country. In 2004, the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (WSSP) was launched in Baku and its environs, with a focus on managing water resources, improving access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, and building capacity in the water sector. In 2013, the government launched a new water sector strategic plan to improve investment in the sector, with the goal of achieving functioning and viable water supply and sanitation (WSS) services by 2020. In addition to the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have also been active in improving the water supply and sanitation in Azerbaijan. NGOs such as Soros Foundation and the International Steering Committee have advocated for improved access to potable water, sanitation, hygiene education and reducing pollution. Azerbaijan is making progress in improving water and sanitation services in the country. By 2017, 99.6 percent of the total urban population and 86 percent of the rural population had access to improved water supply. Coverage in public sanitation is low, with only 44 percent of rural households having access to sanitation services. Despite the progress, the country still faces a range of challenges in its water sector. The most significant challenge is the availability of water due to a lack of infrastructure and efficient water management. Water resources in the country are heavily polluted and this pollution is affecting both human health and the environment. Lack of access to safe and clean water is still a major issue in rural areas, as well as in disadvantaged urban areas. The government of Azerbaijan has committed to further improving water supply and sanitation services in the country. The government will focus on continuing to strengthen the WSSP and reforming the water sector to make it more efficient and accountable. Furthermore, investment in infrastructure and better water management will be essential for the sustainable development of the water sector.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56924005}

In the wake of the Great Depression, Schram helped restore confidence in investment and stocks. Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years.\n\nEarly life\nSchram was born in Peru, Indiana where he attended local schools through high-school. He was accepted into Harvard and Wharton, but couldn't afford tuition. Instead, he went to work in a timber and coal company with local offices. At age 21 he proved himself to be an effective farm manager, making investment decisions that dramatically increased the output of a local farm under the firms control.,\n\nCareer\nSchram's early success in farm management led him accept a position as chairman of the National Drainage Association, an agricultural trade group. While working for the Association, Schram applied for loans with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which was a Depression/New Deal era government corporation tasked with making loans to infrastructure projects and businesses and helping banks resume normal operations.\n\nIn 1933, Schram joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In 1939 he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RFC. His chairmanship was short lived, however, because less than two years later he was offered the position that would define his career.\n\nIn 1941 the New York Stock Exchange was still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. Trade volume was very low, seats were sold cheaper than in previous decades, and the exchange had been the target of political attacks. A selection committee was formed to find a new president, and they selected Schram.  Before his appointment, Schram did not own any stocks and had never been a Wall Street trader, making him the first outsider to become president of the exchange in 155 years.\n\nSchram reformed the management structure of the Exchange, removing many of the traditional committees in favor of a top-town approach. He spent $500,000 per year on nationwide advertising programs encouraging the public to hold on to war bonds in an effort to keep small-time investors out of the market. Under Schram's leadership, the NYSE recovered, and public confidence was restored.\n\nLater career\nIn 1951, at age 58, Schram retired from the Exchange and returned home to Peru, Indiana. Schram was succeeded by G.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank McDonough\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank McDonough is a British historian of the Third Reich and international history.\n\nLife\n\nFrancis [Frank] Xavier McDonough was born on 17 April 1957 in Liverpool. He read modern History at Balliol College, Oxford, as a Senior Status Scholar. He was at Balliol at the same time as Boris Johnson and knew him. He later earned a PhD in history from Lancaster University, under the supervision of Ruth Henig. He was Professor of International History in the History Department of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Liverpool John Moores University until his retirement in 2021. He is an avid Liverpool F.C. fan and still lives in Liverpool with his partner Ann.\n\nWork\nHis key area of research is international history, particularly Anglo-German relations in the 20th century. He has published significant works on the origins of World War I and World War II. McDonough is increasingly publishing his research on the Third Reich, including opposition to Hitler, the Holocaust and the Gestapo.\n\nNeville Chamberlain and appeasement\n\nIn his study of Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, published in 1998, McDonough outlined a 'post revisionist' theory, which built on the work of R. A. C. Parker's 1994 book Chamberlain and Appeasement, by expanding it to include appeasement in society and looking at economic appeasement, the mass media and the opponents of appeasement. McDonough accepted that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but unlike the revisionists he argued that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. He suggested that appeasement must be analysed as a usable policy at the time it operated and focus on how Chamberlain's personality played a crucial role in the conduct of the policy, in particular, his errors of judgement, his failure to listen to opponents and his unwillingness to try any alternatives. McDonough argues that Chamberlain's version of appeasement, as operated by such an inflexible politician, unwilling to change direction, until events forced him to, actually contributed to Britain and France entering the war in 1939 in a much weaker strategic position, and passed the early advantage in the war to Hitler's regime, which meant that Germany only faced one European front until June 1944.\n\nThe study was reviewed in academic journals. Parker described it as \"very well written, with a lively argument, which explores appeasement in society too\". Andrew Thorpe, a leading authority on foreign affairs, described the book as \"a cogent and stimulating analysis of appeasement which will take the debate still deeper\". A leading US historian of foreign affairs from the Reed College, Edward B. Segel, commented: \"The book brings out effectively how the British government manipulated the mass-media, the press and especially the BBC to exclude public criticism of Chamberlain's policies and convey the impression of overwhelming support\".\n\nMcDonough is one of the most prominent 'post-revisionist' experts on Neville Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement, along with Parker, who was, as Sydney Aster points out, his \"academic mentor while he was at Oxford\".\n\nOther books\n\nIn McDonough's 2007 monograph, The Conservative Party and Anglo-German Relations, 1905\u20131914, published by Palgrave Macmillan, he moved the focus of analysis to the Conservative Party's role in the outbreak of the First World War. The study was described in a review in the journal The Bulletin of the German Institute of Historical Research by a German foreign policy scholar as \"a thorough and thought-provoking analysis, which draws on over thirty archives and provides a powerful and overdue corrective to the traditional depiction of the Edwardian Conservative Party as 'Scaremongers' and the chief promoters of Germanophobic views among British political parties in the years that led to the outbreak of the First World War\".\n\nIn addition, to his research on Anglo-German relations, McDonough has written a number of publications on the related subject of the history of the Third Reich, most notably, Hitler and Nazi Germany (1999); Opposition and Resistance in Nazi Germany (2001); and Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party (2003).\n\nAmong his other books are: The Origins of the First and Second World Wars (1997); The British Empire, 1815\u20131914 (1994); and Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement (2002). In 1998, McDonough was commissioned by the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations Board to write a set text entitled Fascism, Conflict and Communism: European History: 1890\u20131945.\n\nIn recent years, McDonough's published work has been focused on aspects of the history of the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2008, McDonough published The Holocaust, with John Cochrane. This book is a new introduction to both the events and the complex international response to the Holocaust and examines the grim reality of life and death in the death camps, the scholarly debates and the impact on popular culture since 1945 of the most horrific aspect of the history of the 20th century.\n\nMcDonough is the author of an English-language biography of the German resistance heroine, Sophie Scholl, entitled Sophie Scholl: The Woman Who Defied Hitler, published by the History Press in February 2009.\n\nIn September 2011, McDonough published The Origins of the Second World War: An international Perspective, about the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn April 2012, the second edition of \"Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party\" was published.\n\nIn August 2015, McDonough's study The Gestapo: The Myth and Reality of Hitler's Secret Police was published by the Hodder and Stoughton imprint Coronet. The book is based on original Gestapo files and tells the story of the victims of Nazi Terror. The book has been published in translated versions in Italy (March 2016), Spain (June 2016), Norway (August 2016), Sweden (September 2016), Finland (2016) and Romania (2019).\n\nThe paperback version of the Gestapo book was released in September 2016 \n\nMcDonough has most recently completed a two volume book titled 'The Hitler Years'. The first volume (Triumph 1933\u20131939) is due to be published on 14 November 2019.\n\nMedia appearances and Twitter\nMcDonough has also appeared on TV and radio. He appeared on CrossTalk on Russia Today in 2010, debating whether the Second World War could have been prevented. He featured in the BBC 1 documentary A Tale of Two Rival Cities, which was part of the BBC's \"History of the World\" project, for which he also acted as Historical Consultant; the documentary won a Royal Television Society Award. He was interviewed in two special programmes on French National Television to mark the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's 18 June 1940 speech when he said the \"flame of French Resistance cannot be extinguished\". McDonough appeared as an historical commentator on France 2 and in a special documentary featuring historians on de Gaulle, broadcast on France 3 on 18 June 2010. He also appeared in the BBC 1 programme Inside Out commenting on a story presented by the actor Paul McGann that looked at whether or not Adolf Hitler visited Liverpool between November 1911 and May 1912. McDonough argued that evidence from Austrian police records, eyewitness accounts from Vienna, and shipping records all strongly indicated that the young Hitler had lived in Vienna at this time, not Liverpool, thus confirming what Hitler claimed in his autobiography, Mein Kampf. In 2012, McDonough appeared in a series on the history of the Third Reich on National Geographic channel entitled Nazi Secrets. He appeared in three episodes: \"Hitler's Damned Women\", \"Hitler's Family Skeletons\" and \"Hitler's Millions\". In November 2013, McDonough was featured in a BBC 1 documentary called The Story of the Swastika and a Channel 5 documentary called 7 Days That Made the F\u00fchrer. In 2014, McDonough appeared in a 10-part documentary series called The Rise of the Nazi Party on Quest TV, part of the Discovery Channel.\n\nMcDonough has a Twitter account called @FXMC1957. It examines key facts in history every morning. McDonough often does Twitter lectures that cover issues such as the JFK assassination, D-Day and the outbreak of WW1 in great depth. He rarely tweets much about his work, his private life or his opinions.

From an early age he was attracted to painting.\n\nHis uncle, the sculptor Jules Printemps, a student of Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy at the \u00c9cole nationale des Beaux-Arts, supported his vocation and prepared him for the entrance examination to this school. He was admitted in 1892, joined the workshop of Gustave Moreau and regularly visited it until Moreau\u2019s death in 1898. He also associated with such artists as  Rouault, Matisse, Evenepoel, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence and Charles Milcendeau.\n\nAround this period his work was largely part of the Symbolist movement and he experimented with a poetic or mythological vision and with the sensuality of the female nude.\n\nWork\n\nPortrait painter \nHe soon established his reputation as a portrait artist receiving commissions from such eminent personalities as Sully Prudhomme, the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Prince and Princess of Waldeck, Mr and Mrs Commettant, and Prince Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps married in 1903 and frequently painted his family in an intimate tone, particularly his daughter Lucile whose death at the age of 6 touched him profoundly, as well as his son Ren\u00e9.\n\nLandscape painter \nL\u00e9on Printemps was a landscape painter his entire life. His desire to meet Flemish masters prompted him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century, returning home with various studies. \nLater in life his attraction to the beaches of Normandy, which were quite fashionable at the time, became more marked. After the First World War he started painting landscapes in Brittany and particularly the islands of the Vend\u00e9e coast, the island of Noirmoutier, the island of Yeu, where he painted seascapes and portraits of fishermen and old farmers\u2019 wives.\n\nFlemish and Dutch influence \nThe appeal of the work of Flemish and Dutch masters during Printemps\u2019 visits to the Louvre Museum inspired him to travel to Belgium and the Netherlands on several occasions with a desire to better understand the art of these great Flemish and Dutch masters. Several paintings, which were the outcome of his first visits to Belgium, were presented at the Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais (1898 and 1905), the Salon artistique des PTT (1905) and in regional exhibitions, in Lille (1898) and in Nantes (1906).\n\nIn 1894 Printemps travelled to Belgium for the first time, presumably in the company of other students of Gustave Moreau, visiting Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp. Two years later he travelled to the Meuse Valley where he painted the Bayard Rock, a remarkable sight in Dinant. In 1897, he spent some time in the Netherlands visiting the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1898, he returned to Bruges and Mechelen. In 1929 and 1933 he also took his son Ren\u00e9, who was also studying to become a painter at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, on a trip to explore these two cities.\n\nL\u00e9on Printemps died on 9 July 1945, in his studio at 6 rue Furstenberg, where the Mus\u00e9e National Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix is currently located.\n\nGallery\n\nParticipation in Exhibitions \u2013 Awards and Merits \n Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais, between 1893 and 1939.

He is best known for his orchestral and chamber works, which often invoke traditional French music. Printemps was born in Paris, France and began playing the piano at a young age. He received his formal education in the Conservatoire de Paris in the early 1980s, studying under the tutelage of composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux. His compositions began to be influenced by his studies of classical and romantic composers, and he soon began to develop his own contemporary sound. In 1989, Printemps's first orchestral piece, \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9giaque\u201d, was performed by the Orchestre National de France and was met with critical acclaim. His success as a young composer caught the attention of renowned conductor Pierre Boulez and together they opened the Ensemble Intercontemporain in 1997. The ensemble was dedicated to promoting the music of up and coming young composers, with Boulez and Printemps at the forefront of the modern music scene. As the recognition of Printemps' compositional prowess grew, so did public appearances. He was invited to perform in national and international locations such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands. Printemps was featured as the composer-in-residence of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 2003, as well as the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris in 2011. Printemps has received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Grand Prix Sacem in 2005, the French Academy of Music Award in 2006, and the Legion of Honor in 2011. He currently serves as the professor of composition at the National Conservatory of Music in Paris, and has published several works, including his most famous orchestral piece \u201cChansons de Cour\u201d (2013). L\u00e9on Printemps remains as one of the premier composers of classical music in France and continues to influence new generations of musicians by providing them with works of great beauty and complexity.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34871387}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Flying Tigers (film)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Flying Tigers (a.k.a. Yank Over Singapore and Yanks Over the Burma Road) is a 1942 American black-and-white war film drama from Republic Pictures that was produced by Edmund Grainger, directed by David Miller, and stars John Wayne, John Carroll, and Anna Lee.\n\nFlying Tigers dramatizes the exploits of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), Americans who fought the Japanese in China, serving with the Chinese Nationalist forces, during World War II. The movie portrays them as fighting before U.S. entry into the war but, in point of fact, they did not see action until after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is unabashedly a wartime propaganda film that was well received by a 1940s audience looking for a patriotic \"flagwaver\".\n\nPlot\nJim Gordon leads the Flying Tigers, a squadron of volunteer American pilots who fly Curtiss P-40C fighters against Japanese aircraft in the skies over China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The pilots are a mixed bunch, motivated by money (they receive a bounty for each aircraft shot down) or just the thrill of aerial combat.\n\nOne day, old friend and former airline pilot Woody Jason signs up under Jim's command. An arrogant, hot-shot aviator, he starts causing trouble immediately. When the Japanese raid the Flying Tigers' airbase, the enthusiastic new arrival goes after them, taking up a P-40 fighter without permission, not realizing until too late that it has no ammunition. As a result, Woody is shot down. He is unharmed after his fighter crash lands, but the precious P-40 fighter is a total wreck. As time goes on, Woody shows that he has little use for teamwork, alienating and endangering the other pilots. He abandons his wingman, Blackie Bales, in order to shoot down a Japanese aircraft. As a result, Blackie comes under fire from another and must bail out of his burning P-40. While hanging suspended in his parachute, he is strafed and killed by the Japanese pilot.\n\nWoody starts romancing nurse Brooke Elliott, who is considered by all the Tiger pilots to be Jim's girlfriend. One night, they go on a date. When he is late getting back for a night patrol, Jim's right-hand man, \"Hap\" Davis, secretly takes his place, despite having just been grounded by Jim because his vision had deteriorated, notably at night. In the resulting dogfight Hap is unable to judge distances accurately and winds up dying in a collision with a Japanese aircraft he is pursuing. This proves to be the final straw; Jim fires Woody. The date is Sunday, December 7, 1941, the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, bringing America into World War II.\n\nA day later, Jim receives notice that a vital bridge must be destroyed. The target is so heavily defended, however, that the only way there might be a chance of succeeding is to fly in very low with a single unescorted bomber; the mission appears likely to be a one-way suicide mission. Jim volunteers to fly the bomber, but Woody invites himself along at the last second, much to Jim's irritation. They proceed to attack the bridge too late to keep a crucial enemy supply train from crossing. Their aircraft is hit by flak and catches fire. Jim bails out with an unexpected push from Woody, expecting Woody to follow. Woody, however, has concealed the fact that he is bleeding, having been hit by shrapnel from a flak burst. He then takes the bomber's controls and crashes into the train, destroying it at the cost of his own life.\n\nCast\nAs appearing in Flying Tigers, (main roles and screen credits identified):\n\n John Wayne as Capt. Jim Gordon\n John Carroll as Woodrow \"Woody\" Jason\n Anna Lee as Brooke Elliott\n Paul Kelly as \"Hap\" Davis, Pilot\n Gordon Jones as \"Alabama\" Smith\n Mae Clarke as Verna Bales\n Addison Richards as Col. R.T. Lindsay\n Edmund MacDonald as \"Blackie\" Bales, Pilot\n Bill Shirley as Dale\n Tom Neal as Reardon, Pilot\n Malcolm \"Bud\" McTaggart as McCurdy, Pilot\n David Bruce as Lt. Barton, Pilot\n Chester Gan as Mike, Mechanic\n Jimmie Dodd as \"Mac\" McIntosh, Pilot (credited as James Dodd)\n Gregg Barton as \"Tex\" Norton, Pilot\n Richard Loo as Dr. Tsing (uncredited)\n Charles Lane as Mr. Repkin\n\nProduction\nFormer Flying Tigers Lawrence Moore (who was a clerk) and Kenneth Sanger (who worked in communications) served as technical advisers on Flying Tigers. Both had left the American Volunteer Group (AVG) in February 1942. None of the real pilots are mentioned by name in the film, which went into production while the original AVG was still in operation.\n\nWhile archival combat footage was used in some of the scenes, miniatures were used to portray the early model Curtiss P-40 WarhawkB/C Tomahawks that the Tigers flew on screen. For all ground shots, full-size P-40 mockups were used that did no more than taxi. They were propelled by V-8 automobile engines, and the elevators and ailerons were missing from their wings and rear horizontal stabilizers. John Wayne's character arrives at the Tigers' airbase on the one-off Capelis XC-12, a failed 1933 twin-engine transport aircraft that found new life at RKO as a non-flying movie prop. The aircraft was also used in Five Came Back and other films.\n\nThe American and Japanese aerial combat footage in Flying Tigers were actually miniatures being pulled along on wires off-screen, created by Republic's special effect experts Howard and Theodore Lydecker. This also included the miniature train and bridge sequence in the film's climax, as well as the miniature of the Capelis air transport seen flying through canyons and eventually crashing into the train. Flying Tigerss special effects were nominated for an Academy Award, but many people voting did not realize the aircraft were miniatures running on wires, thereby passing the film by for the Oscar.\n\nIn 1942, due to wartime priorities that prohibited the use of U. S. military aircraft for Hollywood productions, Republic Studios approached Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo to recreate the aerial battle sequences required for Flying Tigers. A number of P-40F fighter aircraft waiting for delivery to the U. S. Army Air Forces were repainted in American Volunteer Group (AVG) markings, and with the aid of Curtiss test pilots, flew in the film. Chief Production Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher's screen role was in subbing for John Wayne.\n\nPlot and character elements were lifted wholesale from the 1939 film Only Angels Have Wings without any acknowledgement, leading some to suggest that Angels director Howard Hawks should sue.\n\nFlying Tigers was originally going to be called Yanks Over the Burma Road but was changed because of MGM's film A Yank on the Burma Road.\n\nRepublic Pictures provided a larger budget than normal for the film, borrowing John Carroll and David Miller from MGM. In exchange MGM got an option on John Wayne's services.\n\nFilming began in April 1942.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nFlying Tigers only loosely represents the story of the real American Volunteer Group (AVG). Unlike the film characters, all AVG pilots were recruited from active or reserve U. S. military forces, were in Asia with the approval of the U. S. government, and did not see combat before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The first AVG combat mission was December 20, 1941, nearly two weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack. (AVG commander Chennault, however, had seen combat during his prior Chinese service.)\n\nJohn Wayne's character is nicknamed \"Pappy\", a common nickname for older military commanders. This was also the nickname of Gregory Boyington, a United States Marine Corps pilot who flew with the AVG until early 1942. Wayne's character, however, was not based on Boyington, who was not commander of the AVG, and not known as \"Pappy\" until he commanded VMF-214 in late 1943.\n\nThe aviation goggles worn by John Wayne on screen and seen on RKO promotional posters were actually a set of repurposed tank crew goggles.\n\nThe footage of Japanese soldiers firing anti-aircraft guns during the bridge bombing sequence was actually of Chinese soldiers. They are wearing M1935 Stahlhelm German army style helmets, only used by elements of the Chinese Army and not by the Japanese.\n\nThe death of Blackie Bates in Flying Tigers is based on a real AVG combat incident. On January 23, 1942, Flying Tiger Bert Christman's fighter was hit in the engine, and he had to bail out. While descending to the ground in his parachute, he was strafed and killed by a Japanese fighter (Christman was hit in several places and probably died as a bullet passed through the back of his neck). The cruel manner of Christman's death was widely publicized in 1942. The Associated Press published an illustrated feature article about it, and Paramount Pictures made a short documentary about his life. Later in the year, Christman was featured in War bond advertisements that read, \"He gave his life. What will you give?\"\n\nReception\nComing out just after the United States entered the war, Flying Tigers was well received by both public and critics alike, mainly because of the exciting flying scenes. The New York Times said, \"On a patch-work story frame, Republic Pictures has strung a first-rate aerial circus chock-full of exciting dogfights.\" The review in Variety was more exacting, commenting, \"Handicapped primarily by a threadbare script, production also suffers from slow pacing while John Wayne, John Carroll, Anna Lee and Paul Kelly are barely adequate in the major acting assignments. Some of the scenes look repetitious, the same Jap flyers apparently being shot down and killed three or four times over.\"\n\nFlying Tigers was the first Republic film to make more than $1 million.\n\nProposed sequel\nRepublic announced plans for a sequel, Sky Dragons, starring Wayne and Lee,\n\nOscar nominations\nHoward Lydecker (photographic) and Daniel J. Bloomberg (sound) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects; Victor Young for Best Music; Daniel J.

The film stars John Wayne and John Carroll as two members of the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG), an air group working with the Chinese Air force against the Japanese during World War II. The film begins with the AVG being formed in 1941, with pilot Jim Gordon (Wayne) joining the group to avenge the death of his brother, who had been killed while serving in the Chinese Air Force. Gordon is joined by John Tex Riddle (Carrol), a tough Texan who is eager to fight. The AVG set off for China and begin to launch raids against the Japanese, but the enemy proves to be too strong for the increasingly outnumbered Tri-colored forces and their planes. With the help of Chinese ground forces, the AVG manages to turn the tide in the battles. The Japanese finally launch a major attack on Rangoon, but the AVG manage to repel the attacking forces. After several successful missions, the AVG is finally forced to abandon China as the Japanese forces overrun the country. Gordon and Riddle return home to America as heroes, but with the knowledge that the Trip-colored forces were ultimately unsuccessful in their mission. The Flying Tigers is a classic World War II action movie with excellent performances from Wayne and Carroll and thrilling aerial-combat scenes. It is widely considered to be one of the best films of the genre and was a box-office success, grossing over $3 million. The Flying Tigers was added to the National Film Registry in 1995, recognizing the film as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film has had many positive reviews, with Guy Flatley of The New York Times writing that it was \"a good solid job of action entertainment\". The Flying Tigers is an important and exciting film that captures the heroism of the AVG as they battled against overwhelming odds in an effort to save China from Japanese invasion. It is a classic example of late-war production and celebrates the courage and dedication of the brave pilots and their Chinese allies.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6197600}

It is thought to have originated during the 16th century and is still a popular form of entertainment today. Mata Hati Telinga is a mix of martial arts and traditional dance. It is performed by two people, one being the leader, who perform various hand and foot attacks while simultaneously moving in a choreographed pattern. The technique is known to be very precise and intricate and can only be performed in the right environment. The performers usually wear scarves and tassels made of different colors, including yellow, green and red. The yellow signifies bravery, loyalty and harmony, the green represents happiness and joy, and the red represents passion and strength. This correlates with the movements in the dance, which focus on strength and grace. The lead performer also carries a knife and shield, which represent strength and protection. The lead dancer will use the knife to lead the dance and his movements must be precise and accurate. As the performance progresses, the dancers will become more and more inspiring and show their capabilities as performers. At the climax of the performance, the dancer executing the knife strikes will shout to the audience, symbolizing victory and the completion of the performance. The audience will then usually offer a standing ovation, showing their appreciation for the performance. Today, Mata Hati Telinga is believed to be a reflection of Minang culture. It is regarded as an expression of strength and respect, as well as a way to showcase skill and dedication. Mata Hati Telinga has been recognised as a significant form of traditional dance with elements and techniques that are distinct to the Minang people of West Sumatra.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54078207}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reba: Duets\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Reba: Duets is the twenty-seventh studio album by American country music singer Reba McEntire. It was released September 18, 2007,by MCA Nashville Records and September 24, 2007, by Humphead Records in the UK, and was produced by Tony Brown, Dann Huff, McEntire, and Justin Timberlake.\n\nReba: Duets was McEntire's second album to appear in the new millennium decade and one of her most successful crossover albums, as it is her first studio album to chart in Australia and her 3rd to chart in the UK. It was her first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200, while also reaching #1 on the Top Country Albums chart, and was also her final release for the MCA Nashville label. The album featured collaborations from eleven different artists in the genres of country, pop, and rock.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart with sales of 300,000.\n\nBackground\nReba: Duets was recorded at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Allmusic reviewer, Thom Jurek considered that the quality of the album's tracks was different from that of most other collaboration projects, calling it a \"mixed bag\" of material. The first collaborator on the album was LeAnn Rimes, who recorded the track, \"When You Love Someone Like That\" which also appeared on LeAnn Rimes's Family album that same year. Jurek called the duet between the pair \"stellar,\" while about.com called the pairing \"an undeniable outcome of perfection. Reba's strong country voice with LeAnn's young, soulful sound created a new sound like no other.\"\n\nThe second track, \"Does That Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma\" was a collaboration with Ronnie Dunn (half of the duo Brooks & Dunn), who co-wrote the song with McEntire. The third track is a duet with Kelly Clarkson on one of her previous major pop hits, \"Because of You.\" The song was the album's lead single and had already peaked at #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart at the time of the album's release. The song was criticized by allmusic, saying that, \"the song is simply a big, overblown power ballad with guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals -- think Jim Steinman and you get it.\" The same idea was also said about the fourth track, \"Faith In Love\" with Rascal Flatts. The fifth track was performed with country artist, Trisha Yearwood on the song, \"She Can't Save Him\", which was formerly released as a single by Canadian country artist, Lisa Brokop. Tracks six and seven were collaborations with American pop artist, Carole King and country artist, Kenny Chesney, who both help in providing musical variations towards the album. Country Standard Time called track nine (a collaboration with Faith Hill called \"Sleeping with the Telephone\") \"tearful emotion.\"\n\nThe tenth track was a duet with Justin Timberlake on the song, \"The Only Promise That Remains\", which was co-written by Timberlake himself. The song is performed in Celtic melody and Timberlake performs harmony on most of the song's length. The album closes with \"Break Each Other's Hearts Again\", a duet with Don Henley.\n\nCritical reception\n\nReba: Duets gained fairly positive reviews from most music critics. Allmusic's Thom Jurek stated that although he considered it not to be a \"perfect record\", he did find the album to \"deliver\". Jurek concluded by saying, \"It's sincere, it's polished, and it's full of good to great songs delivered in mostly interesting ways.\" In his review, he gave the album three and a half out of five stars.\n\nReviewing the album, Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave praise to McEntire and her production on the release, saying, \"Give credit to McEntire for corralling the egos - including her own - and producing an album with depth, passion and a bunch of great voices.\"  About.com'''s Scott Sexton gave Reba: Duets four and a half out of five stars, overall stating, \"Reba McEntire has proven she can stand the test of time, and with some help from close friends she sounds better than ever.\" Reviewing Reba: Duets in 2007, Lana Cooper of PopMatters acclaimed McEntire's vocal strength in the album by saying, \"Reba's voice manages to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity.\" Cooper overall stated, \"Reba Duets is largely a strong showing.\"\n\nRelease and aftermathReba: Duets was originally planned to be released in April 2007, however the date was pushed to September 18 instead. The lead single, \"Because of You\" was released to radio May 15 and reached a peak of #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart and #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August, shortly before the album's release date. A week after the album's release, it became the United States' best-selling album of the week, debuting at number one on both the Top Country Albums and Billboard 200 albums charts, selling a total of 300,536 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It debuted at number 4 on the Canadian Album Charts. Reba Duets'' was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 2007, becoming her twentieth platinum album. The album's second single, \"The Only Promise That Remains\" (with Justin Timberlake) was released in November 2007, but only reached #72 on the Billboard Pop 100 and did not chart the Hot Country Songs list. The third single, \"Every Other Weekend\" (with Kenny Chesney) was released in 2008. However, the official single featured Skip Ewing as the duet partner instead of Chesney, due to the Chesney version not being \"viable\" for radio (due to radio company issues). It charted outside the main UK top 100 album chart but has sold over 15,000 copies in the UK.

On the west side, which is set back from the line of the Ludwigstra\u00dfe,  are the building of the Odeon (1826\u201328, now the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior) and the identical Palais Leuchtenberg (1817\u201321, now the Bavarian State Ministry of Finance), both modelled on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. On the east side is Klenze's Bazaar Building, including the Caf\u00e9 Tambosi. Between the two buildings on the west side, an unnamed street leads to the Palais Ludwig Ferdinand (1825\u201326, now the headquarters of Siemens). Both this street and the Brienner Stra\u00dfe, which begins at the south end of the square, lead to the adjacent Wittelsbacherplatz, also designed by Klenze.\n\nThe Feldherrnhalle is a copy of the famous Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence.\n\nThe Odeonsplatz is served by the U Bahn station of the same name and by the Museenlinie (museum line) of the Munich bus system. Since 1972, the southern end of the square has been part of the central Munich pedestrian zone.\n\nHistory\n\nAs early as 1790, plans were made in connection with the removal of the old city walls to replace the Schwabing Gate (Schwabinger Tor) with a new square and to make the beginning of the route from the Residenz to Nymphenburg Palace (the F\u00fcrstenweg, now Brienner Stra\u00dfe) more impressive. The current form of the square and the parvis to the south of it was determined by King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1816, while still Crown Prince, commissioned Klenze to lay out the whole of the Ludwigstra\u00dfe, including the square at its southern end. The Italianate neo-classical style of the first building, the Palais Leuchtenberg, set the tone, and unlike earlier plans by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell which had featured buildings surrounded by a parklike setting, Klenze created an enclosed urban square to better fit with the adjacent Old Town. However, the Feldherrnhalle, erected to close the view at the southern end on the site of the demolished gate, was commissioned from Klenze's rival Friedrich von G\u00e4rtner in 1840\u201341. As the building of the square continued, the project expanded to include the new Ludwigstra\u00dfe; originally it had been intended as a central square. As a result, the obelisk in memory of the Bavarian troops who had died fighting with Napoleon in his Russian campaign was instead erected in the Karolinenplatz in 1833. In 1862 an equestrian statue of Ludwig I was added at the mouth of the street between the Odeon and the Palais Leuchtenberg; it was designed by Ludwig von Schwanthaler and executed by Max von Widnmann.\n\nThe Odeonsplatz has traditionally been an important site of parades and public events, including funeral processions (most recently for Franz Josef Strauss in 1988), victory parades (most recently for the Bavarian troops who took part in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871), which proceeded down the Ludwigstra\u00dfe to the Feldherrnhalle, with the VIP rostrum usually being located at the statue of Ludwig I. The annual parade to the Oktoberfest still follows this route.\n\nAccording to many historians, this traditional function was the reason for the Nazi march on the Feldherrnhalle on 9 November 1923 in the course of the Beer Hall Putsch, which ended in a gunfight in which four state police officers and 16 Nazis were killed. During the Third Reich, the annual memorial march passed through the square and continued to the K\u00f6nigsplatz, where the Nazi fallen had been interred. A memorial was erected for them to the east of the Feldherrnhalle, which all passersby were required to honour with the Hitler salute; this was demolished in 1945 and the four police officers remembered with a plaque in the pavement and in 2010 with one on the wall of the Residenz.\n\nThe Odeonsplatz was also the subject of at least one painting by Hitler.\n\nTogether with the Marienplatz, the Odeonsplatz remains an important site for both civic events and demonstrations.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Odeonsplatz City Panorama\n Odeonsplatz during the Nazi era and today\n Susanna Rieger, \"Der M\u00fcnchner Odeonsplatz und seine Geb\u00e4ude\" (PDF) \n Odeonsplatz - video\n\nMaxvorstadt\nSquares in Munich\nTourist attractions in Munich", "machine_text": " Odeonsplatz is a square located in the old city centre of Munich, Germany. It is located south of the Ludwigstrasse, between the Hofgarten and the National History Museum. The square was named after the Odeon, which was the old concert hall located on the square until it was destroyed during World War II. Odeonsplatz was first built on the former Wittelsbach Palace garden in 1816, and it was quickly becoming one of the most important squares of the city. It was also the centre of public celebrations and military parades, including the celebration of the Bavarian King Ludwig I\u2019s Silver Jubilee in 1844. The Odeon was constructed in the centre of the square between 1826 and 1828 and it was the largest concert hall of its time in Munich. The Odeon was the center of musical life in Munich and its concerts featured the works of many illustrious composers such as Wagner, Strauss, Schumann, and Mozart. During World War II the building was mainly destroyed, leaving only the facade standing. The remains of the Odeon were demolished in 1959 and the square was redesigned in the 1970s. Today, the square is a popular tourist attraction and site of many events. It also houses several important heritage sites, such as the equestrian statue of King Max Joseph and the Bavarian State Chancellery, which was the first building in Munich made with reinforced concrete. Odeonsplatz is also the home of the annual long music and theatre festival known as the IKARUS-Festival. It takes place throughout the summer months and features both classic and modern plays and music events. In addition to music and theatre, the festival includes many other elements such as art exhibitions and special performances. During the festival visitors can experience concerts, opera, theatre, art and fashion shows. Odeonsplatz is one of the most important sites in Munich and offers a wealth of activities and attractions. As such, it is considered by many to be an important part of the city's cultural and artistic heritage.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20849935}

According to his biographer, Shams-ud-din's major contribution was his support of strong anti-Ahmadiyya feelings among Muslims at the risk and sacrifice of his life.\n\nEarly life and education \nHe was born on 4 May 1944 (21 Jumada al-awwal 1364 AH) in Balkh Province of Afghanistan to a family of religious scholars. His father Muhammad Zahid Harifal was a sufi theologian. He was the founder and teacher of the Madrasa Shams-uloom at Fort Sandeman in Zhob.\n\nShams-ud-din received elementary religious education from his father. He continued both secular schooling and religious education.\n\nHe matriculated from a government high school in Zhob in 1960. He then attended a madrassa boarding school in Akora Khattak, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He stayed there for two years and continued his education under the guidance of Abdul Haq (father of Sami-ul-Haq, the chief of the JUI). He then attended the Madrasa Arabia New Town Karachi, where he studied under Muhammad Yousuf Binori for two consecutive years.\n\nHe then went to Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and studied at the Madrasa Arabia Makhzan-ul-uloom wa fayuz Eidgah, headed by Pakistani religious scholar Abdullah Darkhawasti.  Realizing the highest spiritual position of his teacher, he immediately became his spiritual student by taking the Bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Naqshbandi order of Sufism.\n\nAfter two years stay he proceeded to his last institution, the Madrasa Nasratul Uloom Gujranwala, to complete the remaining one-year course of Darse Nizami. At that madrasa, Shams-ud-din studied course of Hadiths (narrations of the words and deeds of Muhammad). He gained knowledge of tafseer, Hadith, spiritualism, mysticism, metaphysics, and logic. Thus completing a traditional Dars-i-Nizam course, he acquired his sanad (degree in Islamic knowledge and sciences of Hadith).\n\nAfter completing his graduation he returned to his native city of Zhob, where his father advised him to engage in revitalizing his madrasa. He became the patron of Madrasa, Shams-ul-Uloom following his father's wishes.\n\nAncestral background \nShams-ud-din belonged to the Harifal tribe. Shams-ud-din's forefather had been religious scholars for many generations. His first cousin, Obaid-ullah Khan Harifal, was the sardar (tribal chieftain) of the Harifal tribe. His grandfather, Muhammad Rafique, was a saint and had many disciples, as did his father. Another grandfather, Abdul Haq Harifal, had resisted British occupation, in present-day Shinghar.\n\nPolitical career \n\nShams-ud-din was a member of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, which demanded the government of Pakistan declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the general election of 1970, Shams-ud-din participated and contested the election at PB 10, Fort Sandeman (as Zhob was then known), on the platform of his political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He came in first in the election with 7,578 votes, more than double the total of the second-place finisher, Nawabzada Taimur Shah Jogezai, of the Muslim League (Qayyam), who received 3,726 Votes.\n\nOn 2 May 1972, chairman Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai opened the first session of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan, in the town hall, Quetta. During this session, Nawab Muhammad Khan Barozai of the National Awami Party (NAP) was elected as Speaker of Assembly. The very next day, 3 May 1972, Shams-ud-din was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker.   (Ataullah Mengal had already been elected on 1 May as chief Minister.)\n\nIt was a coalition government of NAP and JUI. Shams-ud-din was the youngest member of the assembly at age 28. Unfortunately, the assembly only lasted for ten months, before the Federal Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dismissed the Provincial Government of Balochistan on 13 February 1973.\n\nArrest\nOn 15 July 1973, Shams-ud-din held a rally in Zarif Sheed Park, Zhob. He delivered a speech against the dissemination of tampered Qurans and literature in his native city, allegedly by Ahmadis. Tampering news inflamed the emotions of the people, which lead to riots and lynchings.\n\nBetween 17 and 18 July 1973, Shams-ud-din's Zhob residence was cordoned off by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him. The next morning, news of his arrest spread through the city, and tribesmen from all around blocked the outgoing roads to prevent him from being taken away. As the public protest grew out of control, authorities took him away by helicopter. This only further inflamed unrest all over the country.\n\nSeveral days after Shams-ud-din's disappearance, Mufti Mehmood demanded on the floor of the National Assembly that his whereabouts be revealed, even if he were dead. On that demand the Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan confessed that Shams-ud-din was alive and in custody at Ma-wand (Kohlu) District, Balochistan. His arrest was controversial throughout the province.\n\nDuring his detention period, his father Muhammad Zahid Harifal received a message from then Governor Akbar Bugti, through his special emissary Saleh Muhammad, seeking a meeting at Quetta, so that the release of Shams-ud-din  could be worked out. Muhammad Zahid declined to accede to this proposal.\n\nA writ petition of habeas corpus was filed in Sindh-Balochistan High Court, Karachi, challenging his illegal confinement and petitioning for his release, on the premise that the prisoner had been detained incommunicado. Shams-ud-din was released on 18 August 1973. He received a grand reception when he returned to Zhob.\n\nA couple of days after his release, he held a rally in Central Jama Mosque, Zhob, and expressed his determination to go ahead with his mission.\n\nMeanwhile, his two colleagues, Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of Muslim Bagh and Hassan Shah, who were elected on the JUI ticket, switched over to the ruling Pakistan People's party. Their actions conjured up illusions of victory in the minds of many hawkish politicians, who believed that Shams-ud-din would also switch parties. He was even offered the position of provincial Chief Minister as a reward, but refused.\n\nDeath \nIn the first week of March 1974, Shams-ud-din left Zhob for Quetta, and along with Muhammad Zaman Khan Achakzai (Provincial General Secretary of the JUI) called on the governor of Balochistan, Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, and conveyed him the message of Darkhawasti, and reminded him his commitment for implementing Islamic laws. The governor replied positively, stating, \"we seek your cooperation\".\n\nAfter his meeting with the governor, Shams-ud-din left Quetta for Khanpur, where he met with his mentor Darkhawasti, who prediction to Shams-ud-din, \"it could be our last meeting\". A few days prior, an attempt had been made on Darkhawasti's life at his official residence in Quetta and Darkhawasti was concerned.\n\nOn 10 March 1974,  Shams-ud-din addressed his last gathering near the vegetable market in Rahimyarkhan, Punjab Pakistan. Later that same day he left for Sibi and stayed overnight.\n \nOn 13 March 1974, Shams-ud-din was driving home to Zhob along with one of his friends. On the way to Zhob, Shams-ud-din stopped in Akhterzai for his noon prayers. After prayers were over, Shams-ud-din resumed the drive. Thirty-five kilometers from Akhterzai, near a village called \"Khulgai\" (Killa Saifullah District), where his friend shot him thrice in the head from behind the driver's seat.\n\nLater that same day, Malik Gul Hassan, who also happened to be on way to Zhob, saw an abandoned car on the side of the road and went to investigate. He found the body of Maulana Shams-ud-din, and the whole interior of car stained with blood. He turned back to Killa Saifullah and informed police and district authorities.\nIt was learnt later that Shams-ud-din's friend had visited him at Quetta and stayed with him for three days before insisting on accompanying him to Zhob.\n\nAftermath\nThe next day, people took to the streets in Quetta, chanting slogans against his assassination. At Bacha Khan crossroads, police clashed with demonstrators, opening fire on the crowd, killing six and injuring more than one hundred people; however, the unrest didn't subside. His funeral prayer became a massive demonstration of popular acclaim. \n\nThe next day, 14 March 1974, he was laid to rest at Zhob graveyard.\nAt 29 years old, Shams-ud-din was survived by his widow and a daughter, his parents, and his brothers.\n\nLegacy\nShams-ud-din's death created such a wave of sympathy that it left political repercussions in the province. North Balochistan is the current political heartland of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who control  not only large numbers of radical Madrassas, but a majority of the legislative seats at both the national and provincial level.\n\nA main crossroads in Zhob was renamed \"Maulana Shams-ud-din Shaheed Chowk\" in 2012 by the people of Zhob.\n\nNumerous legends and popular songs have grown around his personality. People still believe that on his burial there was a shower of petals, and his blood continued to ooze from his body 24 hours after his body, with a fragrant smell.\n\nReferences\n\n1944 births\n1974 deaths\nDeobandis\nPakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam\nPashtun people\nPeople from Zhob District", "machine_text": " Shams-ud-din Harifal (c. 954 - 1037) was an eminent Sufi mystic and a figurehead of the Suhrawardiyya Sufi order. He was born in Harifal, a town in the Hindu Kush mountain range in what is now Afghanistan, and is considered by many as the founder of the Suhrawardiyya order. He was embraced by his master, Sufi leader Abu Nasr as-Sarraj, at a young age and quickly gained fame for his deep devotion, relentless pursuit of truth and knowledge and for his spiritual insights and stature. He was a legendary mentor who inspired many disciples during the 11th century, the most renowned being Jami and the Ghazal poet, Sa'di Shirazi. Sufism is often defined as the mysticism of Islam, and Shams-ud-din was one of its central figures. He stressed the importance of understanding the innermost essences of being and sought to perfect the soul and its relationship to the divine. It's said that he practiced a unique form of Islamic mysticism, combining elements of both the orthodox path and the secretive teachings of Tasawwuf with basic Sufi principles. He served as an ambassador between the Ghaznavid rulers and the people of India, and was heavily involved in diplomatic negotiations, travelling widely amongst the courts of northern India and throughout the region. His diplomatic visits ultimately allowed him to pursue his spiritual studies as he not only interacted with rulers but with philosophers, artisans, merchants and many other people. He is most remembered for his teachings on the spiritual path, his monumental works on Islamic thought, spirituality, and Sufism which he wrote over the course of his lifetime, and for the powerful influence he had among many of the great Sufis and religious scholars of the 11th century. Shams-ud-din Harifal's work had a profound impact on Islamic spirituality for many centuries and is still widely respected to this day. He is remembered fondly in the Suhrawardiyya order and remains a source of inspiration for many around the world. He sought to revolutionize the realms of spirituality, morality, and ethics and his legacy lives on in his profound writings and teachings that are often studied as a part of Sufism today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35206470}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harvey armor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harvey armor was a type of steel naval armor developed in the early 1890s in which the front surfaces of the plates were case hardened. The method for doing this was known as the Harvey process, and was invented by the American engineer Hayward Augustus Harvey.\n\nThis type of armor was used in the construction of capital ships until superseded by Krupp armor in the late 1890s.  \n\nThe Harvey United Steel Company was a steel cartel whose chairman was Albert Vickers. The year 1894 would see the ten main producers of armor plate, including Vickers, Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, Carnegie and Bethlehem Steel, form the Harvey Syndicate.\n\nPredecessors \nBefore the appearance of compound armor in the 1880s, armor plating  was made from uniform homogeneous iron or steel plates backed by several inches of teak to absorb the shock of projectile impact.  Compound armor appeared in the mid-1880s and was made from two different types of steel, a very hard but brittle high-carbon steel front plate backed by a more elastic low-carbon wrought iron plate.  The front plate was intended to break up an incoming shell, while the rear plate would catch any splinters and hold the armor together if the brittle front plate shattered.\n\nCompound armor was made by pouring molten steel between a red-hot wrought iron backing plate and a hardened steel front plate to weld them together.  This process produced a sharp transition between the properties of the two plates in a very small distance. As  consequence, the two plates could separate when struck by a shell, and the rear plate was often not elastic enough to stop the splinters. With the discovery of nickel-steel alloys in 1889, compound armor was rendered obsolete.\n\nProduction process \nHarvey armor used a single plate of steel, but re-introduced the benefits of compound armor. The front surface was converted to high carbon steel by \"cementing\". In this process, the steel plate would be covered with charcoal and heated to approximately 1200 degrees Celsius for two to three weeks. The process increased the carbon content at the face to around 1 percent; the carbon content decreasing gradually from this level with distance into the plate, reaching the original proportion (approximately 0.1\u20130.2 percent) at a depth of around an inch. After cementing, the plate was chilled first in an oil bath, then in a water bath, before being annealed to toughen the  back of the plate. The water bath was later replaced with jets of water to prevent the formation of a layer of steam which would insulate the steel from the cooling effect of the water. The process was further improved by low temperature forging of the plate before the final heat treatment.\n\nWhile the American navy used nickel steel for Harvey armor (roughly 0.2 percent carbon, 0.6 percent manganese, 3.5 percent nickel), the British used normal steels since their tests had shown that ordinary steel subjected to the Harvey process had the same resistance to penetration as nickel steel, although it was not quite as tough.\n\nHarvey armor was taken up by all of the major navies, since  of Harvey armor offered the same protection as  of nickel-steel armor.  It was in turn rendered obsolete by the development of Krupp armor in the late 1890s.\n\nSee also\n\nCarburizing\n\nReferences\n\nGene Slover's US Navy Pages - Naval Ordnance and Gunnery\n\nNaval armour", "machine_text": " Harvey armor is a type of historical body armor used almost exclusively by the English and French soldiers in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance era. It was named after the English knight Sir John Harvey, who created the style in the late 15th century. Harvey armor was one of the most advanced types of body armor during this period, offering superior protection from a variety of weapons, from swords to arrows. Harvey armor, like many body armors of the period, was composed of two parts: a breastplate, designed to absorb the impact of arrows and sword blows; and a backplate, which was designed to protect the back and shoulder area. The breastplate was typically made of iron or a type of steel, while the backplate was made of leather, with metal plating over it. The construction of Harvey armor was unique, as the materials used to create it were actually quite light. This was a great advantage, as it enabled the wearer to move more easily and not be encumbered by heavy armor. However, the armor was still strong enough to provide adequate protection during battle. The two pieces of the armor were held together by metal rivets, and sometimes by laces or leather straps. The armor was also decorated with various metals, such as brass and steel. Common decorations included etchings, brass studs, and designs, sometimes with the crest of the wearer's family engraved into it. The most distinguishing feature of Harvey armor was the presence of the \"pauldrons\"; metal plates on the shoulders of the armor which provided additional protection. They could be of varying sizes, depending on the choice of the wearer. The pauldrons also provided additional protection against arrows, as they could catch the arrow's shaft and prevent it from penetrating the body armor. Overall, Harvey armor was highly effective body armor which provided excellent protection during medieval battles and was highly valued by those who wore it. However, it was eventually replaced with newer, more effective body armors, such as plate armor. Nevertheless, the design and construction of Harvey armor still remains impressive and is highly sought after by historical re-enactment enthusiasts today.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3989449}

In 2006, the hotel announced a major expansion and renovation, including the construction of a new 1,000-room hotel tower, a new 486,000 square-foot casino, and an aquarium - one of the largest in the country. This new addition made Harrah\u2019s one of the largest properties on the East Coast, and added to the overall charisma of Atlantic City. In 2013, Caesars Entertainment announced that it was planning to close Harrah's Atlantic City due to declining revenue and competition from newer casino resorts. The resort was temporarily closed on September 8, 2020 due to economic issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The closure of the resort, along with those of other Atlantic City casino resorts, led to hundreds of lost jobs and the closure of numerous businesses in the city. Harrah's Atlantic City Casino will remain a beloved destination in the memories of many people, and will forever remain an iconic symbol of Atlantic City's history. With its closure, the city is left to look ahead to the future and build on the foundations of its success to find a new path forward.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13727744}

Anna Kafetsi, Ph.D in Aesthetics- Art History and former curator for 17 years of the 20th century collection at the National Gallery of Athens, was appointed founding director of EMST.\n\nHistory\nEMST first operated, from 2000 to September 2003, on the ground floor of approximately 1,800 square meters, of the old Fix brewery, an example of post-war industrial architecture designed by Takis Zenetos. It is located in close proximity to the center of Athens as well as the archaeological sites of the city, including the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. As of 2020, the restoration of the building is in progress in order to create state-of-the-art facilities for the permanent collection, periodic exhibitions, educational programs, and workshops. After an international architectural competition was announced, the architectural office which won the first prize and will realize the renovation of the Fix building are 3SK Stylianidis Architects in collaboration with Ioannis Mouzakis and associates architects LTD \u2013 studies of technical works Pan. Babilis and associates, and INSTA.\n\nUntil the return of the museum to the Fix building, EMST will continue its exhibitions program in the spaces of the Athens Conservatory, one of the most prestigious cultural institutions and finest buildings of architecture in the capital. By 2020, the Greek government spent 40 million euros on the museum, with the Stavros Niarchos Foundation giving a further 3 million euros in the final push towards completion. In the meantime, the delays in the museum's opening cost EMST a 3.3 million dollars subsidy from the European Union. Ownership of the Fix building was transferred from the subway authority Attica Metro, which owned the former brewery since the 1990s, to the museum foundation.\n\nCollections\nPivotal aspect of the EMST\u2019s artistic policy is the enhancement and enrichment of its permanent collections with works from Greek and international artists. There are two main axons according to which the collections are structured: a historic one, dating from the second half of the 20th century, and a contemporary one.\n\nThe museum is developing its permanent collections through purchasing works of art as well as soliciting donations. EMST aims at developing, within the next few years, a core collection of works representative of the basic directions of contemporary art.\n\nAmong the most important acquisitions are works by Ilya Kabakov, Stephen Antonakos, Gary Hill, Nan Goldin, Vadim Zakharov, Gillian Wearing, Ann Sofi Siden, Vlassis Caniaris, Nikos Kessanlis, Eleni Mylonas, Dimitris Alithinos, Nikos Navridis, Joel Sanders, Allan Sekula, Costas Tsoclis, George Hadjimichalis, Chryssa, Yiannis Psychopedis, Andreas Angelidakis, Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis and Tessera.\n\nA rich collection of video art has also been built.

Until the Museum building will have been completed and will be able to open its doors to the public, the permanent collections (both historical and contemporary) are presented in periodical exhibitions with selections of thematic and conceptual nuclei or artistic tendencies.\n\nEducational Programs\nWithin the framework of the educational policy of EMST educational programs for school groups and families, children workshops, tours for adults, and educators' seminars are realized, aiming at contributing to the discovery of and familiarization with contemporary art, Greek and international, of all age audiences.\n\nResearch\nAside from the permanent collection, periodic exhibitions and educational programming, the museum directs its efforts toward establishing an important infrastructure for research and artistic creation in its premises. Within this framework, the National Museum of Contemporary Art will establish and organize a center for the production of audiovisual works of art as well as a center of digital documentation of contemporary art. Both centers will be developed with the support of the Ministry of Culture and the funding programs \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cInformation Society\u201d of the European Union.\n\nPublications\nThe EMST editorial program includes bilingual (in Greek and English) exhibition catalogs, which host theoretical and critical essays, as well as interdisciplinary interpretational approaches bu sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, e.a. Special educational booklets for Primary and Secondary ( High School and Lyceum) education, as well as editions with the Museum new Acquisitions. A series of editions of Critical Essays on contemporary art, as well as artists' monographs based on unpublished material of The Archives of Greek Artists is being prepared.\n\nLibrary and Archives\nThe Library of EMST includes a significant number of specialized editions and journals on the fields of History and Theory of Art, Museology and Conservation of art works as well as on the field of History of Philosophy, Anthropology, Architecture and Industrial Design, New Technologies and Multimedia and is constantly enriched in order to serve scientific research and writing as well as the induction of the staff, of the visitors/researchers and artists. Also, a project for the exchange of editions with institutions in Greece and abroad has already been initiated.\n\nGreek artists and galleries have granted to the museum archives related to contemporary Greek art, after an invitation by EMST. The archives are constituted by catalogues, books, exhibition invitations, audiovisual material, texts by artists, correspondence, critiques, reviews, reproductions of works and biographical data.\n\nThe donation of the archives of Bia Davou and Pandelis Xagoraris by their son Zafos Xagoraris is exceptionally significant. It contains more than 2.000 articles and manuscripts of the two artists, their correspondence between them and also with other fellow artists, correspondence with official Fine Arts institutions, such as the Chamber of Fine Arts and the Ministry of Culture, archival material of the DESMOS gallery, which played a leading role in the artistic scene of the '70s, archival material from the Association of Contemporary Art and Artists and more.\n\nSee also\n National Gallery (Athens)\n Municipal Gallery of Athens\n Benaki Museum, Athens\n State Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nEMST website\nEMST blog\nCity of Athens\nwww.athensinfoguide.com\n\nMuseums in Athens\nModern art museums in Greece\nArt museums established in 2000\n2000 establishments in Greece", "machine_text": " The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens, commonly referred to as EMST, is a nationally funded museum located in Athens, Greece.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rachel\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Rachel () was a Biblical figure, the favorite of Jacob's two wives, and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. Rachel's father was Laban. Her older sister was Leah, Jacob's first wife. Her aunt Rebecca was Jacob's mother.\n\nMarriage to Jacob\n\nRachel is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in  when Jacob happens upon her as she is about to water her father's flock. She was the second daughter of Laban, Rebekah's brother, making Jacob her first cousin. Jacob had traveled a great distance to find Laban. Rebekah had sent him there to be safe from his angry twin brother, Esau.\n\nDuring Jacob's stay, he fell in love with Rachel and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. On the night of the wedding, the bride was veiled and Jacob did not notice that Leah, Rachel's older sister, had been substituted for Rachel. Whereas \"Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful\", \"Leah had tender eyes\". Later Jacob confronted Laban, who excused his own deception by insisting that the older sister should marry first. He assured Jacob that after his wedding week was finished, he could take Rachel as a wife as well, and work another seven years as payment for her. When God \"saw that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb\" (Gen 29:31), and she gave birth to four sons.\n\nRachel, like Sarah and Rebekah, remained unable to conceive. According to biblical scholar Tikva Frymer-Kensky, \"The infertility of the matriarchs has two effects: it heightens the drama of the birth of the eventual son, marking Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph as special; and it emphasizes that pregnancy is an act of God.\"\n\nRachel became jealous of Leah and gave Jacob her maidservant, Bilhah, to be a surrogate mother for her. Bilhah gave birth to two sons that Rachel named and raised (Dan and Naphtali). Leah responded by offering her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob, and named and raised the two sons (Gad and Asher) that Zilpah bore. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah were half-sisters of Leah and Rachel. After Leah conceived again, Rachel was finally blessed with a son, Joseph, who would become Jacob's favorite child.\n\nChildren\nRachel's son Joseph was destined to be the leader of Israel's tribes between exile and nationhood. This role is exemplified in the Biblical story of Joseph, who prepared the way in Egypt for his family's exile there.\n\nAfter Joseph's birth, Jacob decided to return to the land of Canaan with his family. Fearing that Laban would deter him, he fled with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and twelve children without informing his father-in-law. Laban pursued him and accused him of stealing his idols. Indeed, Rachel had taken her father's idols, hidden them inside her camel's seat cushion, and sat upon them. Laban had neglected to give his daughters their inheritance ().\n\nNot knowing that the idols were in his wife's possession, Jacob pronounced a curse on whoever had them: \"With whoever you will find your gods, he will not live\" (). Laban proceeded to search the tents of Jacob and his wives, but when he came to Rachel's tent, she told her father, \"Let not my lord be angered that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me\" (). Laban left her alone, and the idols were not discovered.\n\nDeath\n\nNear Ephrath, Rachel went into a difficult labor with her second son, Benjamin. The midwife told her in the middle of the birth that her child was a boy. Before she died, Rachel named her son Ben Oni (\"son of my mourning\"), but Jacob called him Ben Yamin (Benjamin). Rashi explains that Ben Yamin either means \"son of the right\" (i.e., \"south\"), since Benjamin was the only one of Jacob's sons born in Canaan, which is to the south of Paddan Aram; or it could mean \"son of my days\", as Benjamin was born in Jacob's old age.\n\nBurial\n\nBiblical scholarship distinguishes between two narratives for the site of Rachel's burial, a northern one suggesting a site north of Jerusalem near Ramah (modern Al-Ram), and a southern one placing it close to Bethlehem.\n\nRachel was buried on the road to Ephrath, just outside Bethlehem, and not in the ancestral tomb at Machpelah (where her husband Jacob and her sister Leah were buried). Rachel's Tomb, located between Bethlehem and the Israeli settlement of Gilo, is visited by tens of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n places Rachel's tomb \"at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.\"\n\nAdditional references in the Bible\n\n Mordecai, the hero of the Book of Esther, and Queen Esther herself, were descendants of Rachel through her son Benjamin. The Book of Esther details Mordecai's lineage as \"Mordecai the son of Yair, the son of Shimi, the son of Kish, a man of the right (ish yemini)\" (Esther 2:5). The designation of ish yemini refers to his membership in the Tribe of Benjamin (ben yamin, son of the right). The rabbis comment that Esther's ability to remain silent in the palace of Ahasuerus, resisting the king's pressure to reveal her ancestry, was inherited from her ancestor Rachel, who remained silent even when Laban brought out Leah to marry Jacob.\n After the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin were exiled by the Assyrians, Rachel was remembered as the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children. Jeremiah 31:15, speaks of 'Rachel weeping for her children' (KJV). This is interpreted in Judaism as Rachel crying for an end to her descendants' sufferings and exiles following the destruction by the Babylonians of the First Temple in ancient Jerusalem. According to the Midrash, Rachel spoke before God: \"If I, a mere mortal, was prepared not to humiliate my sister and was willing to take a rival into my home, how could You, the eternal, compassionate God, be jealous of idols, which have no true existence, that were brought into Your home (the Temple in Jerusalem)? Will You cause my children to be exiled on this account?\" God accepted her plea and promised that, eventually, the exile would end and the Jews would return to their land.\n In the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew (part of the New Testament), this reference from Jeremiah is interpreted as a prediction of the Massacre of the Innocents by Herod the Great in his attempt to kill the young Jesus. The Jeremaic prophecy is the inspiration behind the medieval dramatic cycle Ordo Rachelis, concerned with the infancy of Jesus.\n\nIn Islam\nDespite not being named in the Quran, Rachel (, R\u0101\u1e25\u012bl) is honored in Islam as the wife of Jacob and mother of Joseph, who are frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an as Ya\u02bfq\u016bb () and Y\u016bsuf (), respectively.\n\nFamily tree\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\n19th-century BC women\nArameans\nBiblical matriarchs\nBook of Genesis people\nDeaths in childbirth\nHebrew-language names\nJacob\nPeople whose existence is disputed\n19th-century BC Semitic people", "machine_text": " Rachel is a female given name of Hebrew origin, meaning \"lamb.\" The name is prevalent in many cultures and is heard in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other parts of the world.

Rachel was the name of the mother of Joseph and the wife of Jacob, two sons of the biblical patriarch, Isaac. As such, Rachel has symbolic meanings of faith, valor, obedience, and devotion. Among many Christian traditions, Rachel is considered a patron saint and an example of idealized biblical femininity. In popular culture, Rachel is a popular name for television and movie characters. Most notably, a main character on the long-running television series Friends is named Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston. The character is depicted as fashionable, independent, and hardworking. Rachel is also a name connected to literature. The 18th century English author Rachel Hunter is credited with writing books on a variety of topics spanning social issues and feminist causes. Furthermore, Rachel Carson is a prominent 20th century environmentalist whose work helped launch the modern environmental movement. In modern times, Rachel remains a popular name choice in many countries. Parents often select the name Rachel for its biblical ties, its popularity, its simple yet attractive spelling, and its wide variety of available nicknames. These include Rae, Ray, Rach, Rache, and Chelle. Many parents have children with the name with intentions to grow a strong appreciation for the traditional and sentimental value associated with it. The name Rachel is also presented in different spellings such as Rachael, Raquel, and Raechel.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20314501}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"St. Mary's Church (Dedham, Massachusetts)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "St. Mary of the Assumption Church (commonly referred to as St. Mary's) is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church in Dedham, Massachusetts, in the Archdiocese of Boston.\n\nThe first church was constructed in Dedham Centre in 1857 and it was formally established as a parish in 1866. In 1880 the parish built a larger church on High Street, towards East Dedham. The laying of the cornerstone for this \"cathedral in the wilderness\" attracted more than 4,000 people, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood. The new church would not be completed until 1900, and was dedicated by Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate. Today the church hosts one of the largest Life Teen programs in the country.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nThe history of Catholicism in Dedham begins in 1758, only 120 years after the settlement of the Contentment Plantation and fully two decades before the American Revolution. During the French and Indian War the British expelled over 11,000 Acadians from what is today Nova Scotia.  Eleven of them resettled in Dedham, and though the town and the Massachusetts Bay colony were both officially Congregationalist, they were allowed to reside here as French neutrals until they returned to Canada in 1760.\n\nAfter the Acadians returned to Canada in 1760, Dedham would not see another Catholic resident for decades. The first Catholic who spent any length of time in Dedham was Mr. Gill, who lived in what is today known as Riverdale, but was then called Dedham Island. The few Catholics who lived in Dedham would have to travel 16 miles to St. Joseph's in Roxbury, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Franklin Street in Boston, or to St. Mary's in Waltham to attend Mass.\n\nBy the early 1800s a few Catholics had settled in Dedham. The first Mass in Dedham was celebrated in Sunday, May 15, 1843, in the home of Daniel Slattery, with eight Catholics present. An altar was set up by the window. For the next three years Slattery's 17-year-old brother-in-law would bring Father James Strain from Waltham and back each Sunday to minister to the needs of the small congregation.\n\nBy 1846, the Catholic community in Dedham was well established enough that the town became part of the mission of St. Joseph's Church in Roxbury. The flood of Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine necessitated holding Mass in the Temperance Hall, often by Father Patrick O'Beirne. Mass was also occasionally celebrated in the Crystal Palace on Washington Street. Worshipers came from Dedham, South Dedham, West Dedham, and West Roxbury.\n\nFirst Church\n\nThe number and devotion of the first parishioners permitted a church to be constructed within 10 years. In 1856 the cornerstone was laid and, in 1857, the first St. Mary's Church was completed on Washington Street between Spruce and Marion Streets. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 1857, Father O'Beirne said Mass for the first time in a new church that could seat 600.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Father Johnson was publicly raising the issue of discrimination against Catholics in the public schools. In 1885, as a member of the School Committee, he claimed the principal of the Avery School ridiculed Catholic students, and several years later had a lengthy debate with a Protestant minister via letters in the Dedham Standard about the \"rank misrepresentation of the Catholic Church\" in a history book adopted by the School Committee.\n\nIn 1890 there were an estimated 2,000 parishioners, including 957 Irish, 250 English-speaking Canadians, 58 French, 19 Italians and 1 Portuguese. There were 400 students in the Sunday School classes in 1884.\n\nChurch construction\nIn February 1880, it was announced that a Protestant who had business in Boston had paid off the parish's $700 debt, allowing the congregation to commence work on a new building. The cornerstone of the present church was laid at 3:00 on October 17, 1880 by Archbishop John Williams. A crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood to accommodate all those who wished to attend. It was one of the largest gatherings in Dedham's history.\n\nThe footprint of the Gothic church, which Father Johnson said was to be a \"cathedral in the wilderness,\" measures 150' long by 65' wide, and the bell tower is 164' tall. The apex of the ceiling is 80' and it has the longest aisle in the Archdiocese of Boston. It was at the time, and remains today, \"the largest and most imposing church in the town\" and \"one of the most conspicuous edifices\" in the town.\n\nThe interior walls were plastered by William B. Gould, an escaped slave who settled in Dedham. While the upper church was still under construction, the lower church was used for Mass and the upper portion for various fairs and other gatherings. The first mass was said in the lower church on October 24, 1886. The crowd was overflowing, and included 20 Protestants, many of local importance, and a choir from St. Peter's in South Boston.\n\nAfter 20 years of working, praying, and fundraising from the meager immigrant wages of many of the parishioners, the Upper Church was finally completed. It took so long that another architect had to take over but was, Father Fleming said, \u201calmost too beautiful for ordinary use.\u201d\n\nThe upper church was completed and dedicated by Archbishop Williams on September 9, 1900. In addition to Williams, Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate to the United States, attended, as did Bishop Denis Mary Bradley of New Hampshire. The crowd, numbered at 1,200, included the communion class and many prominent citizens of the Town, including Protestants. The dedication packed the church, requiring many to stand, and tickets were required to enter.\n\nAlbert Nickerson, a member of Dedham's St. Paul's Episcopal Church, donated $10,000 towards the effort. The Dedham Granite for the outer walls was donated by another Protestant, John Bullard. The granite came from Bullard's own lot.\n\n20th century\nIn June 1890, Father John H. Fleming arrived at St. Mary's and began a 33-year tenure as pastor. During his pastorate the parish the upper church would be completed, the parish cemetery in West Roxbury would be purchased, and the old wooden rectory next to the church would be torn down so a new rectory could be built of Dedham Granite in 1913. On Sundays, however, the quality of his preaching was such that other priests would come to St. Mary's to listen.\n\nIn the 1920s, with the building work completed, new pastor Father Henry A. Walsh was able to focus on the various groups and societies within the parish. The Catholic population in the area grew, as did the amount of social activity within the parish. By 1936, the parish was one of the largest in the Archdiocese of Boston with 6,000 parishioners, four priests, and six nuns. The Sunday School alone had over 1,300 pupils. Within months of arriving as pastor in 1929, Father George P. O'Connor began a parish school with three Sisters of St. Joseph. He also began a Catholic Youth Organization, and was generally regarded as having a focus on youth.\n\nModern history\nIn the 1960s, St. Mary's remained one of the largest parishes in the archdiocese. As it was too much work for one pastor and three assistant priests, a second parish was established for the Riverdale neighborhood, St. Susana's, in 1962. As the school was also growing, a new convent was constructed in 1964.\n\nThe number of people attending Mass each week began to drop off rather dramatically in the early 1990s. In 1989, the average weekly attendance was 2,843 people. By 1995, however, it dropped to just 1,030. The following year, 1996, Father (later bishop) John Anthony Dooher and Father Chris Hickey arrived at St. Mary's within weeks of each other. Mass attendance increased by 50% that year alone, and in 1997 it was over 2,500. In September 1997, Hickey and youth minister Se\u00e1n Flynn began a Life Teen program to minister to high school students.\n\nParish\n\nIn 2006, the parish served 2,329 families, and in 2015 it sponsored 38 ministries in six categories: prayer, liturgical, social, outreach, health and wellness, and parishioner sponsored.\n\nLife Teen\nOne of the largest ministries in St. Mary's today in its Life Teen program, which ministers to high school aged youth. It was founded in September 1997 by Fr. Chris Hickey, then-pastor John Dooher, and youth minister Se\u00e1n Flynn.\n\nThe teens' \"enthusiasm for church has brought a special vibrancy\" to the parish. A Life Teen mass is offered on Sunday evenings and features a live band, and is then followed by social and catechitical sessions known as Life Nights. Participants have their own prayer night, perform community service, and gather to socialize in their clubhouse.\n\nConvent and parish office\nBehind the church on Avery Street is the Parish Office. It was previously a convent that housed the nuns who taught in the parish school. The stained glass windows in the building were done by Chartrand.\n\nCemetery\nIn 1880, the Town of Dedham set aside a portion of Brookdale Cemetery, just a block away from St. Mary's, for Catholics to be buried. Under the pastorate of Fr. John H. Fleming (1890-1923), the parish purchased its own cemetery just over the border in West Roxbury. It still operates the cemetery on Grove Street today.\n\n150th anniversary\nIn 2016 the parish celebrated its 150th anniversary with a year long celebration. Included in this was a mass on October 2 celebrated by Cardinal Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley. Other events included a healing mass and an organ concert.\n\nVocations\nTwo LifeTeen alumni, Will Sexton and Mike Zimmerman, were ordained priests. Sexton and Zimmerman were both teens in the program, and were ordained alongside Kevin Leaver, who was a CORE member. Together the three made up 50% of those being ordained at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in 2017. As of 2017, two other alumni and one former CORE member are seminarians for the Archdiocese of Boston, and one alumnus joined the Carmelites. From 2003 to 2018, the parish sent 15 men to the seminary.\n\nNotes and citations\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\n\nSt. Mary's LifeTeen\n\nAcadian diaspora\nFrench-Canadian culture in Massachusetts\nHistory of Dedham, Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic churches in Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic parishes of Archdiocese of Boston\nReligious organizations established in 1866\n1866 establishments in Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic churches completed in 1900\nChurches in Dedham, Massachusetts\nStone churches in Massachusetts\n20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States", "machine_text": " St. Mary's Church is a historic Episcopal Church located in the city of Dedham, Massachusetts. It is owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. History St. Mary's Church was founded in 1760 as a Congregational Church by members of Dedham's Old South Congregational Church. Early records indicate that the church was initially known as the Blue Church and held services downstairs in a brick meetinghouse. In 1820 the church was reorganized and converted to the Episcopal faith. It was then renamed St. Mary's Church, in honor of its patron saint, the Blessed Virgin Mary. At this time, the congregation moved upstairs to the main sanctuary and its name was changed. St. Mary's is considered by many to be one of the oldest Congregational churches in the state, founded seven years before the American Revolution. The church has seen a number of renovations and upgrades over the years, including the addition of a gothic-style facade, a bell tower, and a parish hall in 1912. Architecture St. Mary's is a Gothic-style building, constructed of brick and bluestone. The bell tower is located at the front of the building and is topped with a copper spire. A gothic rose window is at the center of the facade. Inside, the sanctuary features a high ceiling, exposed beams, and stained glass windows. Today St. Mary's continues to serve the local community through outreach and worship. Its services are attended by members of all denominations, and its doors are open to everyone. Services are held every Sunday, as well as weekly weekday services and special events. St. Mary's is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been listed since 2002. The building is considered a \u201clandmark\u201d of Dedham and is an important piece of the town's history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45670562}

He led the New Democratic Party of Quebec from April to September 1989 and helped bring about its autonomy from the New Democratic Party of Canada.\n\nEarly life and political career before 1989\n\nNadeau was born in Joliette in 1953. He was a Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) activist before joining the New Democratic Party and served as an executive assistant to legislator Guy Chevrette. He was also a supporter of the municipal Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM) and served on its economy committee. In 1988, he criticized the party's pro-business direction in government.\n\nHe ran for the House of Commons of Canada as the New Democratic Party candidate for Hochelaga\u2014Maisonneuve in the 1988 federal election. He criticized the proposed Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement on the grounds that it would hurt manufacturing jobs in his riding. Nadeau was considered one of the party's strongest candidates in Quebec, and some party insiders believed he had a chance for an upset victory. In the event, he finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Allan Koury.\n\nShortly before election day, Nadeau and six other NDP candidates with Quebec nationalist views held a press conference to denounce Canada's policies on bilingualism.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader\n\nNadeau was elected to lead the Quebec New Democratic Party in April 1989, defeating incumbent leader Roland Morin. The election contest was centred on the Quebec NDP's relationship with the federal party. At the time, the NDP had a single party organization in Quebec that was responsible for both federal and provincial matters. Several members of the Quebec NDP opposed its links to the federal party, particularly in light of ideological divisions on issues relating to Quebec nationalism. The Quebec party supported the province's Charter of the French Language, opposed the Meech Lake Accord, and were sceptical toward the Canadian constitution because it was approved without Quebec's support. Nadeau favoured the creation of a separate provincial party, while Morin initially opposed it before declaring his neutrality.\n\nNadeau, who was thirty-five years old at the time, also highlighted the generational divide between himself and the fifty-seven-year-old Morin. He said, \"The leadership choice is clearly between a democratic socialist who has a vision for the '90s and one who is clinging to the outdated notions of the '70s.\" For his part, Morin described Nadeau as a single-issue candidate focused only on the environment. Nadeau defeated Morin at a party convention held on April 30, 1989, as the party also voted to separate from the federal organization and become a completely distinct entity.\n\nThe NDP ran fifty-five candidates in the 1989 election. Its campaign began in confusion, when the party executive approved an election platform that Nadeau derided as \"naive Marxism.\" He initially threatened to resign as party leader, but refrained when the executive agreed to withdraw the offending document. Nadeau later described the platform as having resulted from the \"fertile imagination\" of a single party worker who misunderstood the instructions of its policy committee.\n\nNadeau secured a more prominent place for environmental issues in the party's revised platform, but he could not prevent party activists from adding a focus on Quebec nationalism. Nadeau opposed this on strategic grounds, arguing that it would not help the party build support. Others argued that it prevented the party from winning support among anglophone Liberals who were disgruntled with the nationalist policies of premier Robert Bourassa.\n\nClose to election day, Nadeau acknowledged that his party would not win any seats in the legislature. The NDP received about one per cent of the popular vote, and Nadeau received only 437 votes for a distant fourth-place finish in the Montreal division of Dorion. He resigned as party leader on September 26, 1989, one day after the election, saying that the Quebec NDP would never be able to succeed because of a \"hard core of Marxists\" hindering its development.\n\nSince 1989\n\nNadeau was a researcher for the municipal Democratic Coalition party in the early 1990s.\n\nElectoral record\n\nSource: [http://www2.electionsquebec.qc.ca/corpo/francais/elections-generales-provincial.asp?bsq=Dorion&section=resultats_gen&even=%271989%27&mode=%27n3%27#resul Official Results, Le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections du Qu\u00e9bec].\n\nSources: Report of the Chief Electoral Officer, Thirty-fourth General Election, 1988; Report of the Chief Electoral Officer Respecting Election Expenses, 1988.\n\nReferences\n\n1953 births\nNew Democratic Party candidates for the Canadian House of Commons\nQuebec candidates for Member of Parliament\nNew Democratic Party of Quebec candidates in Quebec provincial elections\nLiving people\nPeople from Joliette\nQuebec CCF/NDP leaders", "machine_text": " Ga\u00e9tan Andr\u00e9 Nadeau (1921 - 2018) was a Canadian cardiologist, surgeon, and scientist, who specialized in researching and creating treatments for cardiovascular diseases and disorders.

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.\n\nPlot summary\nThe Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring.  The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.\n\nAunt Gertrude's carton\nEnigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you\u2019ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.\u201d Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy\u2019s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude\u2019s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.\n\nGoing fishing\nLater, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.\n\nMysteries in Bayport\nMeanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.\n\nAunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme.\n\nTaking a cruise\nThe boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.\n\nMr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.\n\nThe boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship\u2019s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture'''s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship\u2019s crew and captured.\n\nCaptivity\nHeld captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship\u2019s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line \u201csailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster\u2026\u201d. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail  (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly \u201csmuggler\u201d Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain''.\n\nReferences \n\nThe Hardy Boys books\n1947 American novels\n1947 children's books\n1970 American novels\n1970 children's books\nNovels set on ships\nGrosset & Dunlap books", "machine_text": " The Phantom Freighter, also known as the Flying Dutchman, is a legendary sailing ship believed to be cursed and doomed to sail the seas for all eternity. The phantom ship is said to appear suddenly and unexpectedly out of a dense fog and is often reported to be illuminated by ghostly blue lights. It is believed that anyone who sets eyes upon this ill-fated ship is doomed to be taken by the devil. Originating from European maritime mythology and folklore, the phantom freighter is most commonly associated with the Flying Dutchman, a vessel cursed by the Devil after its captain, Vander Decken VI, refused to turn back despite warnings of an impending storm. In mythology, the freighter is said to sail endlessly in search of salvation, but its fate remains cursed, as it can only rest when it has been crossed by a living person. Perhaps the most famous sighting of the phantom freighter occurred in 1881, when the cargo ship godspeed reported seeing a strange sailing vessel, entirely crew less and shrouded in fog. As they drew closer, the crew of the godspeed claimed to have seen a woman on board the phantom freighter, leading many to believe that it was the Flying Dutchman itself. The legend of the phantom freighter has been featured in countless works of literature and film, from William Hope Hodgson\u2019s 1904 novel The Ghost Pirates to Disney\u2019s 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. It has also inspired songs, such as The Dubliners\u2019 \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d and Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d Today, the Phantom Freighter remains a captivating figure of folklore and mythology, and continues to be a source of fascination for sailors, adventurers and authors alike.

Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions. It was thus that the diocese was enriched by the presence of such congregations as the Benedictines of Solesmes, both monks and nuns. Five Abbeys (Douai, Quarr, Farnborough, Ryde, and East Cowes) were founded in the diocese.\n\nBishop Cahill died at Portsmouth on 2 August 1910, aged 68.\n\nReferences \n\n1841 births\n1910 deaths\nRoman Catholic clergy from London\nRoman Catholic bishops of Portsmouth\n20th-century Roman Catholic bishops in England", "machine_text": " John Cahill (born 1950) is an Irish Roman Catholic bishop, best known for his role as Bishop of the Diocese of Killaloe in Ireland.

Bilardi's background has been described as radically different from other Western recruits and symbolises youth issues more than ideological ones.\n\nLife, radicalisation and death\nBorn in Craigieburn, Victoria, Bilardi was a shy, lonely boy and student who was reportedly bullied by peers. Bilardi kept a blog describing his disdain for United States forces committing crimes against Muslims in the Middle East. He became radical after his mother died of cancer. By 2014, he expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden on Facebook. Concerned that the Australian government was monitoring him, Bilardi turned to building explosives in the event he would not be able to leave the country. A recruiter for Jabhat al-Nusra made contact with him in August 2014 and he left for Iraq.\n\nBilardi died in a suicide attack in Ramadi, Iraq on 11 March 2015. The Iraqi Army stated Bilardi's attack was unsuccessful, killing only himself. ISIL used his death as propaganda, in order to recruit more people to become suicide bombers. According to a friend, Bilardi was concerned his family would \"spend eternity in hell\" for being non-believers.\n\nReaction\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott, commented on Bilardi's death as an \"absolutely horrific situation\", stating, \"it's very, very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking, alien and extreme ideology.\" Greg Barton, director of the Centre for Islam and the Modern World considers Bilardi a self-radical motivated by underlying mental health issues instead of religious zealotry.\n\nSee also \n 2015 Parramatta shooting\n Jihobbyist\n Terrorism in Australia\n\nReferences\n\n1996 births\n2015 suicides\n21st-century Australian criminals\nAustralian Islamists\nAustralian Sunni Muslims\nConverts to Sunni Islam\nCriminals from Melbourne\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant members from Australia\nSuicide bombers\nPeople from Melbourne\nSuicide bombings in 2015", "machine_text": " Jake Bilardi (June 25, 1996 - March 18, 2015) was an Australian teenager who was born in Melbourne, Australia. Bilardi, an Australian-born Muslim, was a member of Ansar al-Sunna, an Islamic State-affiliated group in Iraq. Bilardi was raised in Melbourne by his mother and stepfather, both of whom were later identified as having been displaced from Iraq as children. He made the decision to travel to Iraq after becoming radicalised online, and in November of 2014, Bilardi travelled undercover to Iraq. Having been born and raised in Australia, Bilardi had never visited Iraq before. In Iraq, Bilardi underwent religious and military training, eventually joining the Ansar al-Sunna group. As part of this group, he participated in several attacks against Iraqi security forces, including a suicide bombing in Ramadi in 2015. Bilardi was one of the youngest foreign fighters to be actively involved in the conflict in Iraq. In March 2015, Bilardi was reported missing and in June of that year, his family confirmed that he had died in Iraq. In the following month, a video was released by the Islamic State showing Bilardi preparing to commit a suicide bombing in Ramadi. The video generated widespread debate in Australia, with many commentators questioning whether the Australian security forces had done enough to prevent Bilardi from travelling to Iraq in the first place. Bilardi's story has been the subject of numerous documentaries, articles and books. In particular, his story has been used to illustrate the difficulties faced by young Muslims in balancing their faith and their lives in a contemporary Western society and how radicalisation can occur as a consequence of the pressures associated with this. His story has also been used to encourage dialogue between governments, security services, and community leaders in order to prevent future cases of radicalisation occurring. Furthermore, academics have used his story to discuss issues of youth identity, the roles played by online radicals, and the limits of state security capabilities. In Australia, his story has been used as an example of the need to strengthen communication between security services and Muslim communities in order to identify and address potential sources of radicalisation. In 2015, the state government of Victoria established the Jake Bilardi Prevention and Support Services, which provides assistance to young people who are vulnerable to, or have already been affected by, extremist ideologies.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46328622}

About ten years before the start of the series, Vasser was engaged to Deputy District Attorney Olivia \"Livia\" Beale, who he shared an apartment with. At the same time Katie was dating Vasser's brother, Jack. When Livia was believed to have been killed in an airplane crash, Vasser developed a gambling problem. It was at this point that Katie (who had recently split-up with Jack) and Vasser became romantically involved.\n\nVasser begins to involuntarily time travel on his seventh wedding anniversary, at first thinking he is hallucinating. With every trip he realizes that he is 'traveling' to help change the outcome of people's lives for the better. On his travels, Vasser is helped by Livia, who he initially believes is a ghost.

Dan is a journalist from San Francisco and the protagonist of the series. He is portrayed by Kevin McKidd. Dan discovers he is a \"Time Jumper,\" a human who, every few days, is inexplicably transferred short distances, or further, in time, both backward and forward. Although travelling through time holds no true physical dangers, Dan is informed via newspaper articles at various points in time that he will eventually die in a major disaster, making his journey to prevent the tragedy a primary plotline throughout the series. Dan's primary motivation to explore his time-jumping ability is to re-connect with his former beloved, Livia Beale (Alexa Davalos), whom he inexplicably lost contact with after he proposed to her eight years prior. Dan soon discovers that he is mysteriously travelling through time to save the lives of other people. He soon meets his mentor, Morgan, who informs him that he must help the people in some way in order for him to be able to move on in his life. At times, Dan confronts ethical dilemmas when the person he is rescuing will most likely alter the lives of others, but then again, there are times when not helping the person would lead to greater calamity. Throughout the show, Dan discovers that he can also have an influence in the lives of other people as Dan chooses to be both a father figure and confidante through his time-travelling experiences. Dan's brother Jack (Reed Diamond) and friend Katie (Moon Bloodgood) both come to understand Dan's time-traveling secrets. In the 21st episode, it is discovered that the person guiding Dan is his former love Livia, who also acts as a search engine for the information he needs in order to complete his tasks. Ultimately however, Dan's ultimate goal comes true as Livia and him actually be together, as two changes of time have Livia becoming his wife and the mother of his daughter Zoe. Sadly, the series was never allowed to explain completely through the remaining 13 episodes, as Fox chose to cancel the show after just one season. Nevertheless, Dan Vasser will always remain an iconic persona in the science fiction genre, not just because of his travels through time, but because of his brave attempt to alter various points of time and his inspiring wish to be reunited with the love of his life.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13554647}

It has an apparent magnitude of +5.50, meaning it is barely visible to the naked eye, according to the Bortle scale. While parallax measurements by the Hipparcos spacecraft give a distance of approximately 430 light years (133 parsecs), dynamical parallax measurements put it slightly closer, at 368 light-years (113 parsecs) from Earth.\n\nSigma Piscium is a spectroscopic binary system, meaning the components of the system have been detected from periodic Doppler shifts in their spectra. In this case, light from both stars can be detected and it is double-lined. It has an orbital period of 81 days, and the orbit is relatively eccentric, at about 0.9. Both components are B-type main-sequence stars.\n\nSigma Piscium is moving through the Milky Way at a speed of 23.5\u00a0km/s relative to the Sun.

It is located just east of the tail of the constellation at the boundary with Aries, and is close to the celestial equator. It is visible to the naked eye, although binoculars make it easier to observe. Sigma Piscium is a yellow-white F-type main sequence star with a mean apparent magnitude of 4.9. It is about 2.4 billion years old, and has an estimated radius of 1.8 solar radii. It has a 3.4 solar mass and is about 2,600 light-years away from the Earth. It has an effective temperature of 7,220 K. Sigma Piscium is a single star, with no visible stellar companions. It has a relatively weak magnetic field with a strength of 84 \u00b1 5 G, which is typical of a main sequence star of its spectral type. It is a slow rotator, with a rotational period of 200 days. Sigma Piscium is visible in the night sky all year round, even though it does not rise to peak visibility until the end of winter. It can be found at the same position as the constellation of Pisces in the northern sky, and can be used as an anchor point for locating other stars in the area. As a relatively easy target for amateur astronomers, Sigma Piscium is sometimes used as a point of reference while guiding beginners in their star-viewing practices. Its luminosity can also be easily observed with the most basic of astronomical instruments such as a pair of binoculars, allowing the observer to obtain a rough estimate of its surface temperature and rotational period. Sigma Piscium is known to science since antiquity, although it was not until the 19th century when its classification as an F-type star was established. As a relatively bright star, Sigma Piscium is of interest to professional astronomers. A common practice is to use it as a reference star while observing and measuring the brightness of stars in its vicinity, so as to obtain a better understanding of the light-years' distance from its neighbors. In the Chinese sky, Sigma Piscium is known as 'Wei She' and represented part of a large asterism called 'Bear Blocking the Way'. This asterism was part of a larger, larger one known as 'Qiriao', which represents a wall made of piled-up furniture trying to block a bear from pursuing a man.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36869441}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank Staff\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank Staff (15 June 1918 \u2013 10 May 1971) was a South African ballet dancer, choreographer, producer, and company director. He was a major figure in the history of European theatrical dance in South Africa.\n\nEarly life\nFrank Cedric Staff was born to an Irish mother and an English father in the diamond mining town of Kimberley, in what is now the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. As a teenager, he moved to Cape Town, where he attended Diocesan College and received his early dance training from Helen Webb and Maude Lloyd, who had studied with Marie Rambert in London. After Lloyd returned to England in 1933, she encouraged her young pupil to join her. At age fifteen, Staff moved to London to continue his training at Rambert's school in Bedford Gardens.\n\nCareer\nStaff was soon invited to join Rambert's Ballet Club, as her performing group was then called. For the next twelve years, from 1933 to 1945, he worked with the Rambert company as both a dancer and choreographer. Except for two seasons with the Vic-Wells Ballet, 1934/35 and 1938/39, and a brief stint with Walter Gore's London Ballet in 1940, he was a featured performer and choreographer with Ballet Rambert.\n\nDancer\nStaff inherited many of Hugh Laing's roles in the Rambert repertory, including The Lover in Jardin aux Lilas and Mercury in The Planets, both works by Antony Tudor. He also danced in several ballets by Frederick Ashton, among them Recamier, Fa\u00e7ade, and Mephisto Valse. For the Vic-Wells company, he appeared as Horn Blower in The Rake's Progress by Ninette de Valois and created the role of Cupid in Ashton's Cupid and Psyche (1939). For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La F\u00eate \u0116trange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Faur\u00e9 by Andr\u00e9e Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.\n\nChoreographer\nStaff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev. All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years. During the war years in England\u2014September 1939 to May 1945\u2014Staff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.\n\nUpon completion of his military service, Staff returned to his homeland in 1946 and joined the South African National Ballet in Cape Town. There he danced in his own ballets and produced works in which he had appeared in England, notably Nijinsky's L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune and Howard's Death and the Maiden. Returning to Britain in 1947, Staff spent the next few years as an international freelance. He served as resident choreographer of the Metropolitan Ballet (1947\u20131948), toured Australia with Ballet Rambert (1948), toured the United States and Canada with Sadler's Wells Ballet (1949), and was subsequently appointed ballet master and choreographer at the Empire Theatre (1950) on London's Leicester Square. In 1953, he went back to South Africa and in 1955 founded his own company, the South African Ballet, for which he choreographed or produced more than fifteen works, including Don Juan (1955), with music by Rachmaninoff; Transfigured Night (1957), to music by Schoenberg; and The Swan of Tuonela (1958), to music by Sibelius.\n\nIn 1963, the South African government established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces, and Staff would eventually work with them all: the companies of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB Ballet), the Natal Performing Arts Council (NAPAC Ballet), the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (PACT Ballet), and the Performing Arts Council of the Orange Free State (PACOFS Ballet). For CAPAB Ballet, based in Cape Town, he mounted Romeo and Juliet (1964), to the Prokofiev score, and for NAPAC Ballet, in Durban, he set Apollo 65 (1965), to music by Benjamin Britten. Moving on to the Transvaal in 1966, he worked in Johannesburg until 1968 as resident producer and choreographer with PACT Ballet under the direction of Faith de Villiers. These years were especially productive. Beside staging his popular Peter and the Wolf, he created seven new ballets. Among them were Spanish Encounter (1966), set to the classical guitar music of Joaquin Rodrigo; Five Faces of Euridyce (1966), set to music by Stephen O'Reilly and described as a \"good-humoured ballet in five visions\"; Czernyana III, the third rescension of his first big hit; and Raka (1967), a three-act ballet set to a score by Graham Newcater and based on an epic poem in Afrikaans by N.P. van Wyk Louw. Raka proved such a success that it was soon made into a film that was distributed worldwide by Twentieth Century Fox.\n\nThereafter, Staff was artistic director of PACOFS Ballet in Bloemfontein from 1969 until his death in 1971. Among the six ballets he created for this company were two notable works made in 1970: Mantis Moon, based on a Bushman legend and set to music by Hans Maske, and S\u00e9ance, derived from Menotti's opera The Medium but set to music by Britten. Staff's unfinished work, The Rain Queen (1971), set to a commissioned score by Newcater, was planned as the first full-length ballet with an indigenous South African theme. The title character, known as the Rain Queen, was Modjadji, the hereditary queen of the Lobedu people (ba Lobedu) of the Limpopo Province. In homage to Staff, the work was rechoreographed by David Poole and mounted for CAPAB Ballet in cooperation with PACOFS.\n\nPersonal life\nStaff married four times. He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works. He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet. Each of Staff's four wives bore him a son.\n\nReferences\n\n1918 births\n1971 deaths\nSouth African choreographers\nSouth African male ballet dancers\nBallet choreographers\nRambert Dance Company dancers", "machine_text": " Frank Staff (born 22 October 1917) is a British sculptor and painter who is one of the most influential and important British sculptors of the 20th century.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Outlaw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An outlaw is a person declared as outside the protection of the law. In pre-modern societies, all legal protection was withdrawn from the criminal, so that anyone was legally empowered to persecute or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In early Germanic law, the death penalty is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from Roman law, as the status of homo sacer, and persisted throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the common law of England, a \"Writ of Outlawry\" made the pronouncement Caput lupinum (\"Let his be a wolf's head\", literally \"May he bear a wolfish head\") with respect to its subject, using \"head\" to refer to the entire person (cf. \"per capita\") and equating that person with a wolf in the eyes of the law: not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights, being outside the \"law\", but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal. Women were declared \"waived\" rather than outlawed but it was effectively the same punishment.\n\nLegal history\n\nAncient Rome\n\nAmong other forms of exile, Roman law included the penalty of interdicere aquae et ignis (\"to forbid water and fire\"). People so penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty.\n\nInterdicere aquae et ignis was traditionally imposed by the tribune of the plebs, and is attested to have been in use during the First Punic War of the third century BC by Cato the Elder. It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the Senate, magistrates, and Julius Caesar as a general and provincial governor during the Gallic Wars. It fell out of use during the early Empire.\n\nEngland\n\nIn English common law, an outlaw was a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a summons to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a crime. The earliest reference to outlawry in English legal texts appears in the 8th century.\n\nCriminal\nThe term outlawry referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside the sphere of legal protection. In the common law of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g. from mob justice. To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of civil or social death. The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support\u2014to do so was to commit the crime of aiding and abetting, and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of \"wanted dead or alive\" is similar, but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial. \n\nAn outlaw might be killed with impunity, and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice\u2014to do so was not murder. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay, otherwise the dead man's kindred might clear his name by their oath and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man.\n\nBy the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw. If a man was accused of treason or felony but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed to be convicted of the said offence. If he was accused of a misdemeanour, then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime.\n\nIn the context of criminal law, outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture; and by the adoption of international extradition pacts. It was obsolete by the time the offence was abolished in 1938. Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, William John Bankes, who had previously been an MP for several different constituencies between 1810 and 1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for homosexuality and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw.\n\nCivil\nThere was also a doctrine of civil outlawry. Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment. It was however imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts. The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.\n\nIn the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in civil procedure by reforms that no longer required summoned defendants to appear and plead. Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of civil duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and, in Scots law until the late 1940s. Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply.\n\nIn other countries\n\nOutlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient Norse and Icelandic legal code.\n\nIn early modern times, the term Vogelfrei and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being \"free\" for the taking like a bird.\nIn Germany and Slavic countries in 15th\u201319th centuries groups of outlaws composed from former prisoners, soldiers etc. became an important social phenomenon. They lived off robbery and their activity was often supported by local inhabitants from lower classes. The best known are Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk and Jakub Surovec in Slovakia, Oleksa Dovbush in Ukraine, R\u00f3zsa S\u00e1ndor in Hungary, Schinderhannes and Hans Kohlhase in Germany.\n\nThe concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of bushranging. The Felons Apprehension Act (1865 No 2a) of New South Wales provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special bench warrant requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended \"alive or dead\" by any of the Queen's subjects, \"whether a constable or not\", and without \"being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension.\" Similar provisions were passed in Victoria and Queensland. Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976.\n\nAs a political weapon\n\nThere have been many instances in military and/or political conflicts throughout history whereby one side declares the other as being \"illegal\", notorious cases being the use of proscription in the civil wars of the Roman Republic. In later times there was the notable case of Napoleon Bonaparte whom the Congress of Vienna, on 13 March 1815, declared had \"deprived himself of the protection of the law\".\n\nIn modern times, the government of the First Spanish Republic, unable to reduce the Cantonal rebellion centered in Cartagena, Spain, declared the Cartagena fleet to be \"piratic\", which allowed any nation to prey on it.\n\nTaking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as Ethiopia's Kassa Hailu who became Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia.\n\nPopular usage\n\nThough the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the pro forma Outlawries Bill which is still to this day introduced in the British House of Commons during the State Opening of Parliament), romanticised outlaws became stock characters in several fictional settings. This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and Western movies. Thus, \"outlaw\" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to \"law-and-order\" notions of conformity and authority (such as the \"outlaw country\" music movement in the 1970s).\n\nSee also\n\nAbrek\nAmerican Old West\nAttainder\nBanditry\nBill of attainder\nBorder reivers\nBounty hunter\nBrigandage\nBuccaneer\nBushranger\nCanga\u00e7o\nCaput lupinum\nCivil death\nDacoity\nList of depression-era outlaws\nGangster\nList of Old West gunfighters\nHajduk\nHighwayman\nHomo sacer\nHonghuzi (\"red beards\")\nKlepht\nMerchant raider\nNazi hunter\nNithing\nOstracism\nOutlaw (stock character)\nOutlaw motorcycle club\nPiracy\nRiver pirate\nRobber baron (feudalism)\nRobber\nShanlin\nShifta\nSocial banditry, a term invented by Eric Hobsbawm\nThug\nUntouchability\nVigilante\nWarg\nWolf's Head, a Yale University senior society named for the legal maxim associated with outlawry\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \nCriminal law\nLegal history\nPunishments", "machine_text": " Outlaw is a term used to refer to an individual who lives in a state of disregard for the law. It can also refer to a person or group of persons who have been excluded from the protection of the law. The term can apply to both criminal activity and to civil disobedience that challenges laws or customs. Throughout history, legislation and common usage has categorized people as outlaws for various reasons, including being declared enemies of the state, disregarding customs, or breaking unjust laws. In the early periods of history, outlaws were viewed as criminals who lived beyond the law and had no legal protection or recourse from their actions. In ancient Mesopotamia and the Middle Eastern nations, the term \"outlaw\" was sometimes used to refer to a person under sentence of death for certain crimes. Outlaws were believed to have been barred from seeking redress for grievances, or from attending court or gathering for group activities due to their declaration as enemies of the state. In feudal societies, when kings and other rulers wielded total power and control, the concept of outlawry was used as a tool to control the population. Outlaws were declared enemies of the state and were ceremoniously and forcibly removed from their villages and tribes. They were often branded as criminals, robbers, or thieves and were often subjected to cruel punishments as a way to keep the rest of the population in line. In some cases, particularly during the period of the Wild West, outlaws were seen as folk heroes. These individuals often went against the grain of society and gained notoriety for their exceptional skills, fearlessness, and defiance against tyranny. Today, the term outlaw is still used in certain contexts, such as organized crime or for political dissidents, but has generally come to refer to any individual or group who are considered to be outside of, or rebellious against, the laws of society. In popular culture, the term outlaw has come to also refer to those who flout the law or traditional norms for their own personal gain or sense of justice. Outlaws are typically portrayed as rebels or renegades who challenge the status quo and rebel against the norms of society, or uphold their own individual code of morality or justice.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 266307}

This marked the first time since World War II that a navy sub operated in those waters. The Norfolk also cruised briefly off the coast of Libya in a show of force. The submarine visited various ports, including: Taormina, Italy; Antalya, Turkey; Beirut, Lebanon; and Soudha Bay, Greece. In 1989, the Norfolk was deployed to the North Atlantic and Mediterranean.

Kenny Davis had a background in gospel music and Reggie Moore played in a funk band; they met Sonny Ellis while they were both attending high school. The three members instantly clicked musically, and decided to form a group. The Vels played gigs around Detroit and were eventually discovered by a representative from Island Records.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jisha murder case\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Jisha murder case was a rape and murder crime that shook the Indian state of Kerala during April 2016 and it went on to become the most publicized crime case during the Kerala Legislative elections in May 2016.\n\nVictim background\nJisha, a 29-year-old law student at the Government Law College, Ernakulam, was found murdered on 28 April 2016 at her home near a canal in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. Jisha was a Hindu woman belonging to the scheduled caste. She was living with her mother, who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, who had separated from the family, lived alone and was found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police were puzzled in the initial stages of the investigation, due to the mother's paranoia and the family's lack of relationships with neighbors or relatives. This affected the case's progress initially, among other factors.\n\nMurder\nThe police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Alappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death.\nAccording to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching.  Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.\n\nCase impact\nThe crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.\n\nArrest of murderer\nThrough continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A man hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.\n\nSentencing and aftermath\nAdvocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for the accused Ameer ul Islam in the Jisha murder case. Advocate Biju Antony Aloor (popularly known as Advocate B A Aloor) hails from Aloor, a place in the Thrissur district in the Kerala state of India. He has also appeared in the court as the defence lawyer for Govindachamy, the man who was accused of murdering a woman traveling in a train in 2011 in Thrissur.For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence.\n\nThe case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner. The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court, in December 2017, awarded death penalty to Ameer ul-Islam, the sole accused in the case. He was also awarded life term, and rigorous imprisonment of 10 and 7 years.\n\nReferences\n\n2016 crimes in India\nRape in India\nStalking\nMay 2016 crimes in Asia\nMurder in India\n2016 murders in Asia\n2010s murders in India\nDeaths by stabbing in India", "machine_text": " The Jisha murder case (or Perumbavoor rape and murder case) was an incident of rape and murder which occurred on 28 April 2016 in Perumbavoor, Kerala, India. The victim, Jisha, was a 30-year-old law student from the lower-middle class Dalit colony of Guruvayurappan Lane in Perumbavoor. The gruesome nature of the crime, the suspect remaining on the loose for almost two months and social activists alleging police inaction over the case brought it to the attention of the public and the media. At 5 pm on 28 April 2016, Jisha's mutilated body was found by her mother in the house. The postmortem reportedly showed that the victim had been brutally attacked and raped, and died from injuries to the head, chest and abdomen. Based on circumstantial evidence from the crime scene, a team of experts from the Kerala Police arrested a 24-year-old man named Ameerul Islam from Assam on 21 June 2016 in connection with the crime.Islam was an ex-convict who had been released after serving a jail term in Karnataka for theft. The case had been closely monitored by the High Court of Kerala which also directed that the case be tried as a fast-track court case, and on 18 February 2017, the Fast Track Court in Ernakulam imposed the death sentence on Islam after finding him guilty of rape and murder. He was also convicted of criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and destruction of evidence, which were all 'heinous, revolting, and despicable' according to the judgment. The incident has been the cause of a great outcry for justice for the Dalit communities in Kerala, especially after reports emerged that the police initially failed to investigate the case to their full extent. Subsequently, the Kerala government set up a commission of Inquiry to investigate the lapses on the part of the police as well as to report on whether there was an attempt to falsely implicate anyone in the case. The Jisha rape and murder case has been an eye-opener for the state of Kerala, with many criticizing the lack of provision for the safety and security of the marginalized. In response, the police department started a number of initiatives such as setting up special tehshildar offices and special nodal officers in all districts, along with a 24-hour helpline and a toll-free helpline. The Kerala government also announced a \u20b910 lakh compensation package to the victim's family and allocated \u20b950 lakh towards the construction of a house in the victim's name. An additional \u20b92 lakh was also announced to the family after the court found the accused guilty. The Prime Minister's National Relief Fund was later utilized to provide a compensation of \u20b93 lakh to the family. The incident was the first of its kind, raising alarming concerns about the safety of women and other marginalised groups in India. It raised the demand for proper and prompt monitoring, investigation and proper justice for the victim from all levels of society. With its strong message, the case brought to light the various issues of discrimination and violence towards women and other disempowered groups. The Jisha case has brought about a change in the standard of Indian investigation and legal system, and has paved the way for stringent punishments for heinous crimes. As a result of the case, several state and central governments began to extend more funds and resources towards the protection and security of women. In the future, proactive steps should be taken in order to protect and empower marginalized communities, in line with the principle of social justice.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50480156}

He competes as a monoskier in the LW 12-1 class and is known as a \"speed specialist,\" preferring to compete in downhill and super G.\n\nCareer\nBramble grew up in New Jersey and began skiing recreationally in Pennsylvania's Poconos at age 11. By 1994, he was a serious snowboarder and occasional skier living in the Lake Tahoe area when he became paralyzed in a snowboarding accident. He soon taught himself to monoski and moved to Winter Park, Colorado, where he joined the Winter Park Disabled Ski Team. He returned to the Tahoe area soon after, settling in Truckee, California, but having acquired the racing skills that he needed. He was named to the U.S. Disabled Ski Team in 1998 after winning the super G at that year's U.S. Disabled Alpine Championships.\n\nSince 1998, Bramble has had an on-and-off relationship with the U.S. Ski Team, often competing in World Cup competition but eschewing traditional race training in favor of freeskiing with friends at Squaw Valley, California. His greatest success has come in downhill, beginning with a World Cup win on the Paralympic course at Snowbasin, Utah in 2001. A year later, Bramble was the odds-on favorite to win the downhill gold at the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, and he did not disappoint, beating teammate Chris Devlin-Young by just 0.17 seconds. Two years later at the Disabled Alpine Skiing World Championships in Wildsch\u00f6nau, Austria, he again won gold in downhill, defeating Germany's Thomas Mayer by an astonishing 1.44 seconds. Two years later at the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Italy, the pressure was on Bramble to win his third straight major world downhill championship. Once again Bramble proved his dominance, again knocking teammate Devlin-Young down to the silver-medal position with a wild run that won him the gold by nearly a full second.\n\nBramble has made a reputation for himself not only as a racer but also as a freeskier. One of the first people to take a monoski into terrain parks, halfpipes, and extreme terrain, Bramble and teammate Monte Meier are featured in Warren Miller's 2006 ski movie Off the Grid.\n\nMonoski manufacturer\nAfter several years skiing in a monoski he had purchased, Bramble decided to design and build his own. After several prototypes resulted in a model he was satisfied with, he began hand-building monoskis for friends and teammates, and Kevin Bramble Goodz (KBG) was born. After operating the business out of his garage in Truckee for several years, Bramble relocated back to his home town of Cape May Court House, New Jersey, in 2004 so his family could help him run the business. Seven out of the 10 current U.S. Disabled Ski Team monoskiers ski in KBG monoskis. Bramble also builds his own unique, three-wheeled wheelchairs and has plans to launch a downhill mountain-bike wheelchair soon.\n\nReferences\n\n1972 births\nAmerican male alpine skiers\nPeople from Middle Township, New Jersey\nLiving people\nParalympic alpine skiers of the United States\nAlpine skiers at the 2002 Winter Paralympics\nAlpine skiers at the 2006 Winter Paralympics\nParalympic gold medalists for the United States\nMedalists at the 2006 Winter Paralympics\nMedalists at the 2002 Winter Paralympics\nMedalists at the 2010 Winter Paralympics\nX Games athletes\nParalympic medalists in alpine skiing", "machine_text": " Kevin Bramble (born February 7th, 1950, in New York City) is an American entrepreneur and businessman who is the founder and president of Bramble Holdings, a venture capital firm.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bears\u2013Giants rivalry\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Bears\u2013Giants rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. The rivalry was notable for the six NFL championship games between the two teams prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, and the two subsequent Super Bowl-era playoff meetings that involved two of the NFL's greatest defensive units: the Bears' 46 defense crew helmed by Buddy Ryan, and the Giants' Big Blue Wrecking Crew mentored by Bill Belichick.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Super Bowl era\nThe Bears and Giants met in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL Championship or Super Bowl. Between 1933 and 1946, the Bears and/or the Giants appeared in 12 of 14 NFL championship games, and combined to win seven championships in that span. Their first meeting came in the first-ever NFL Championship Game that concluded the 1933 season. In a close-knit affair, the Bears won the game and the championship 23\u201321 by scoring the game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. It was Chicago's second consecutive championship, having previously won in 1932 when the league awarded the title to the team with the best regular season winning percentage. However, the Giants returned the favor in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, winning 30\u201313 by outscoring the Bears 27\u20130 in the fourth quarter. The game was forever immortalized as the Sneakers Game, as the Giants switched to basketball sneakers at the half due to the slick frozen conditions that affected the Polo Grounds field. \n\nThe Bears and Giants met for a third time in the 1941 NFL Championship Game. This game was notable as it happened two weeks following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; as a result, only 13,341 fans attended the game at Wrigley Field, the lowest of any NFL championship game. The Bears dominated the Giants 37\u20139 to win their fifth NFL title, thanks to four unanswered touchdowns in the second half. A fourth meeting took place in the 1946 NFL Championship Game, in which a then-record 58,346 fans witnessed the Bears defeat the Giants 24\u201314 in New York. The game was tied 14\u201314 after three quarters before the Bears scored ten unanswered points. The victory was marred, however, by a bribery scandal involving two Giants players.\n\nIn the 1956 NFL Championship Game, the Giants routed the Bears 47\u20137 at Yankee Stadium to win the championship. It was the team's last title until Super Bowl XXI in 1986. Similar to the 1934 title game, the Giants wore sneakers in order to gain traction on an icy field.  Seven years later, the Giants and Bears met for a sixth time to decide the 1963 NFL Championship. In a low-scoring affair, the Bears prevailed 14\u201310 to win their eighth NFL championship, their last until Super Bowl XX in 1985. It was also the final meeting between the Bears and Giants that decided the NFL championship.\n\nSuper Bowl era\nThe two teams underwent lengthy rebuilding periods following the 1963 title game, but in the 1980s, the Bears and Giants reemerged into title contention, thanks to two of the greatest defensive units in NFL history. Chicago's 46 defense, coached by Mike Ditka and defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, featured Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, and defensive ends Richard Dent and Dan Hampton. New York's Big Blue Wrecking Crew, on the other hand, were coached by Bill Parcells and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, and featured Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor, Carl Banks and Harry Carson. The two teams first squared off in the 1985 NFC Divisional Round, in which Chicago's defensive crew outplayed their Giant counterparts in a 21\u20130 shutout. The tone of the game was set when a punt attempt by Giants punter Sean Landeta was muffed in the strong winds and Shaun Gayle returned it five yards for a touchdown. The Bears went on to win the Super Bowl that season. A rematch then took place in the 1990 NFC Divisional Round, which also ended in a blowout. This time, however, the Giants dominated Chicago in a 31\u20133 rout, and went on to win Super Bowl XXV. To date, this was the most recent meeting in the playoffs between the Bears and the Giants.\n\nRecent years\nAfter the 1990 playoff meeting, the rivalry cooled off a bit, though games between the two teams remained highly competitive. However, there were some notable moments that took place since then. During Week 10 of the 2006 season, Bears returner Devin Hester returned a missed field goal a then-record 108 yards for a touchdown, culminating in the Bears' 38\u201320 victory. The win proved crucial for the Bears as they went on to finish with the NFC's best record at 13\u20133, en route to a Super Bowl XLI appearance. The Giants, on the other hand, turned a 6\u20132 start into a 2\u20136 finish, ending with an 8\u20138 record and losing in the Wild Card Round to the rival Philadelphia Eagles. Then in Week 4 of the 2010 season, the Giants defense sacked Bears quarterback Jay Cutler nine times in the first half en route to a 17\u20133 victory, dealing Chicago its first loss of the season.\n\nGame results \n\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| \n| style=\"| Bears  19\u20137\n| Polo Grounds\n| Bears  1\u20130\n| Giants' inaugural season.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Master of Marketing Research\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Master of Marketing Research (MMR) is a graduate degree program that may be from one to three years in length. Students pursuing this degree study the aspects of research in the field of marketing.  Unlike an M.B.A., which is a general business degree, the Master of Marketing Research focuses solely on the aspects of marketing research.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first Master of Marketing Research was developed by the Terry College of Business, University of Georgia in 1979.  Marketing faculty, together with leading marketing research professionals, developed a curriculum that \"was designed to develop marketing research professionals of the highest caliber and thereby satisfy a critical need of U.S. business.\"  This was further followed by the MMR program at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1986 and the MSMR program at The University of Texas at Arlington in 1990. To date, these three programs are considered to be the pioneers of higher education in the marketing research industry.\n\nMaster of Marketing Research degree \n\nGenerally, a Master of Marketing Research combines classroom work with real-world research opportunities and special projects.  Courses stress practical application to real-world marketing research problems, rather than the theoretical application suggested in most bachelor's business degrees.\n\nThese degrees give specific instruction on research methodology, variable coding, and database construction and management.  Classroom topics might include database management, focus group development, statistics in marketing, and consumer behavior.\n\nDifferent Program Titles \nThe Master of Marketing Research (M.M.R) may also be known as the Master of Science in Marketing Research (M.S.M.R.), Master of Science in Marketing Analytics (M.S.M.A.).  Similar in nature to the Master of Marketing Research is a Master of Business Administration with an emphasis in marketing research. In Europe, the degree is known as Master in Market Research and Consumer Behavior at IE University/IE Business School and as Master of Marketing Analysis at Ghent University. In Canada, the degree is known as Master of Business-Marketing/Analysis.  In Australia, the degree is known as Master of Business in Marketing Research (M.B.M.R.) at Edith Cowan University, and as Master of Marketing (M.Mrkt.) at the University of Tasmania.\n\nCurriculum\nThe curriculum of any Marketing Research program requires a student to complete the required prerequisites to accommodate the deficiency for non business background students. After that there are a series of core classes and electives. Some of the programs are lock step method programs following a particular sequence of series of courses lined up one after another. Other programs are open programs giving the students to chance to select their own courses. The courses are mainly divided into two genres qualitative and quantitative\n\nQualitative\nQualitative research consists of in-depth interviews famously called as IDI's as well as focus group. The qualitative research is mainly focus on cognitive and social psychology effect of marketing research. Understanding the thought process rather than analyzing it is the main priority of qualitative research.\n\nQuantitative\nQuantitative research mainly deals with application of bi-variate and multivariate statistics to marketing research. IBM SPSS is mostly widely used tool for data analysis though some companies would prefer to stay with excel and WinCross. Industrial application of statistics is limited to cross tabulations using Chi square estimation, but some companies do use linear and logistic regression analysis. More recently, Conjoint analysis is one of the new techniques that has become popular for its application on product bundling and pricing.\n\nQuantitative research is applied to ad-hoc and tracking studies; it is mainly primary research with different studies (methods) and analysis techniques.\n\nType of Quantitative Studies\nConcept testing, Copy testing, Customer experience study, Pricing study, Product testing, Brand awareness, Market segmentation, and Trade-off analysis\n\nQuantitative Techniques\nMaxDiff (Concept testing w/ monadic randomization), CSat & NPS score (Customer experience study), Van Westendorp pricing (Pricing study), Conjoint analysis (CBC) (Trade-off analysis), & Two-step cluster & K-means cluster analysis (Market segmentation)\n\nAdvanced Data Analysis Techniques (Not to get confused with data analytics)\nDriver analysis (Linear regression), Factor analysis (EFA), and Perceptual mapping\n\nRecent trends affecting marketing research education \nJob Specialization.\nThere is evidence that modern professional jobs are rapidly being disaggregated  and becoming increasingly specialized. While management of the marketing mix will continue to be overseen by generalists broadly trained in business and/or marketing, this trend towards specialization is creating new opportunities for professionals with focal training in the area of market research and the closely related area of consumer behaviour. The current and future job prospects for these market research specialists are highly attractive.  For example, in the United States by 2018 jobs in Market and Survey Research are expected to grow to 350,500 as compared to 197,500 jobs for Marketing Managers, 43,900 jobs for Advertising and Promotion Managers and 64,100 jobs for Public Relations Managers.  These two trends\u2014specialization of professional jobs, and high demand in the labor market for market research specialists\u2014suggest an increasing importance for post-graduate training designed to provide a gateway for university graduates seeking to pursue careers in the areas of market research and consumer behavior.\n\nConsumer Behavior Research by behavioral and neural scientists continue to make large contributions to our understanding of human decision making, and their findings are exerting a strong influence on the nature of marketing and market research.  As companies struggle in a new world of \"big data\" and social media such as Twitter and Facebook, companies are facing increasing challenges in collecting, analyzing and interpreting this data to better understand their customers. This suggests that consumer behavior and Customer insight will likely play an increasing role in the work of market researchers.\n\nCareers in marketing research \nCareers in marketing research are divided mainly into two types supplier organization and client organization. Supplier side jobs are purely consulting jobs which are very similar in nature with management consulting jobs. Nielsen Corporation formerly known as AC Nielsen is the biggest supplier in the business followed by Kantar Group, Ipsos, GfK etc.\n\nSupplier organization \nSupplier organization is multiple domain organization where MR graduates focus on multiple domains of industry. Depending upon the client requirements research is designed and executed. Most of the MR graduates work as statistician, analyst, account executive, field work director etc. Supplier organization work in similar nature to that of management consulting.\n\nClient organization \nClient organization  single domain organization where MR graduate focuses completely on a single domain of industry. The various organizations which recruit MR graduates are in the domain of telecom, food processing, aviation, retail chain, media etc. The positions for which they recruit are director, assistant research director, senior analyst, analyst etc. Many supplier side consultants seek full-time employment with the clients they advise during their tenure in the supplier organization.\n\nJob & Placements Scenarios \nWith the increase in demand of marketing researchers there has been a surge in number of jobs available in research. Increasing number of suppliers have also increased the number of positions available in market. Most placements take place through alumni networks which benefits the graduate candidates to secure job before graduation. Most companies do recruit US citizens, but very few recruit international candidate due to visa sponsorship conditions. Other reasons would be qualitative work in research and abundance of available resources for recruitment.  International candidate is required to evaluate all criteria's and information before embarking on tenure for the graduate program. Prospective international candidates should take the initiative to talk to program director regarding international student placement before enrolling into the program. A list of number of international students enrollments and international students placements would be helpful to evaluate the strength of the program.\n\nCertifications\n\nProfessional Certified Marketer (PCM) \n\nProfessional Certified Marketer (PCM) is a certification offered by American Marketing Association (AMA) . AMA is an American organization based in Chicago, Illinois. It is considered as a credential which symbolizes mastery of marketing knowledge and commitment to quality in the practice of marketing.

Among other Bulbothrix species, only B.\u00a0isidiza has isidia combined with an underside that is light coloured. B.\u00a0isidizas laciniae are wider, while its thallus is pale, and contains salazinic acid. In turn, B. ventricosa is larger and a black underside and rhizinae. The African species B.\u00a0decurtata is an obligately saxicolous lichen, and while similar, it has a dark underside and produces salazinic acid in its medulla. The species' name thus refers to its uncommon dark gray colouration of its thallus.\n\nDescription\nBulbothrix cinerea possesses a dark gray thallus and is saxicolous, measuring between  wide, being tightly adnate. Its laciniae measure between  wide, being shiny at the apex and laterally overlapping, also adnate. The species' ramification is irregularly dichotomous, with rounded apices, a crenate margin with a black line. It shows cilia that are between  long. Lacinules, soredia and pustulae are absent in this species.\n\nIts isidia are abundant, being laminal, cylindrical, irregular in diameter, and slightly inflated in shape. Its medulla is white, with a chestnut-dark brown coloured underside, being rugose, veined and papillate. The rhizinae are light brown, simple and bulbate, measuring between 0.1 and 0.5 mm\u00a0long. Its apothecia are coronate, about  in diameter, while the amphithecia are isidiate. It counts with 8 spores per ascus, which are ellipsoid and measure between  long and  wide.\n\nHabitat\nThis saxicolous species finds itself tightly attached to its substrate and is frequently found on exposed quartzite rocks.  It is known from Brazil, including the Espinha\u00e7o and Mantiqueira Mountains.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBenatti, M.

It was first described by German mycologist C.A. Blom in 1892, who placed it in the genus Dyplolabia. Today, it is classified as a species of Bulbothrix. The fruit body of B. cinerea can be found growing as fruticose lichen on trees, rocks, and other types of substrates. It is pale grayish-brown in color, with a thin, loopy texture. The lower surface of the thallus often has a distinct cat-scratch-like pattern due to the presence of rhizines. The thallus produces flattened, disc-shaped apothecia which contain the asci and spores. The apothecia have a paler center where the asci are located, surrounded by a thin margin which can vary in color from brownish to blackish. Microscopically, the asci contain 5-6 ellipsoidal spores, with dimensions of 10\u201318 \u00d7 5\u20136 \u03bcm. B. cinerea is widespread throughout parts of Europe, North America, and Asia, preferring moist habitats on acidic substrates. It has been studied for its potential as an indicator of air pollution, as it has been shown to be sensitive to levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. Other than this, its use in humans is limited. Despite its cosmopolitan distribution, B. cinerea is not common in most areas, and is sometimes considered rare in some regions of Europe. However, in Great Britain, it is perhaps more variable and abundant than in other parts of Europe, and can be found relatively easily with a keen eye and close inspection of potential microhabitats. Overall, B. cinerea is a distinct, albeit rare, species that can be found in many parts of the world. It has a unique appearance, as well as potential use in monitoring of air pollution, making it an interesting and important subject of fungal research.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47163356}

Sandin (born 1942) is an American video and computer graphics artist, designer and researcher. He is a Professor Emeritus of the School of Art & Design at University of Illinois at Chicago, and co-director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is an internationally recognized pioneer in computer graphics, electronic art and visualization.\n\nBiography\nDan Sandin received his B.A. in Natural Sciences from Shimer College in 1964 and his M.S. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1967. He became interested in video in 1967, while helping to organize student demonstrations at the University of Illinois. In 1969, he joined as a teacher at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in order to bring technology into the arts program. This was shortly after his presentation of \"Glowflow\", a computer controlled light and sound system, created with Myron Krueger, Jerry Erdman, and Richard Venezky. By 1972, Thomas A. DeFanti joined UIC and together with Sandin they founded the Circle Graphics Habitat, now known as the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL).\n\nIn 2018 Sandin's work, the Sandin Image Processor and the Sayre Glove, was included in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, curated by jonCates. He also gave a demonstration of Particle Dreams in Spherical Harmonics in the CAVE 2 system, and was part of the symposium both of which were connected to the exhibition as a series of events.\n\nHis major achievements were working on a series of projects including: Glowflow (1969), Sandin Image Processor (IP) (1971\u20131973), Sayre Glove (1977), PHSColograms (1988), CAVE (1992) and ImmersaDesk and Infinity Wall.\n\nAwards \nDan Sandin received several awards including: the Guggenheim Fellowships awarded for video and sound in 1978, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for video art (with Stevenson Palfi) in 1981, the Rockefeller Foundation's Video Fellowship in 1981, the Inventor of the Year award from the University of Illinois in 2000, and the Rockefeller Foundation's Film, Video and Multimedia Fellowship in 2002 for \"Looking for Water 2,\" a virtual-reality, 3-D installation.\n\nWork\nDan Sandin has said that his career has three main objectives: \n the design of electronic instruments and computer programs for visual performance and personal growth;\n the development of educational facilities and programs related to the use of electronic screens; and\n the production and exhibition of computer processed visual works for personal expressive reasons.\n\nSandin Image Processor\n From 1971 to 1973, he designed the Sandin Image Processor, a patch programmable analog computer for real-time manipulation of video inputs through the control of the grey level information. His friend and neighbor Phil Morton helped with the early schematic plans diagram. This modular design was based on the Moog synthesizer. With Tom DeFanti, he would combine it with real-time computer graphics and synthesized music and perform visual concerts. He has performed worldwide and has received grants in support of his work from the Rockefeller Foundation (1981), the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts (1980) and the Guggenheim Foundation (1978). His piece \"Spiral PTL\" was one of the first pieces included in the Museum of Modern Art's video art collection.\n\nThe Sayre Glove\nIn 1977, with Tom DeFanti and Rich Sayre, he designed the Sayre Glove, the first data glove, as part of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. This device used light based sensors with flexible tubes with a light source at one end and a photocell at the other. As the fingers were bent, the amount of light that hit the photocells varied, thus providing a measure of finger flexion. It was mainly used to manipulate sliders, but was lightweight and inexpensive.\n\nPHSColograms\n\nBy 1988, Sandin was working on a type of digital photography called PHSColograms; a system whereby a number of still images were situated in an autostereoscopic manner and back-projected with light. The effect was very similar to holograms and many times viewers would mistake them as such. The initial system supported roughly 13 images but further improvements now could easily allow 100 such images to be used. This system was designed primarily for use in the medical field where these quasi-3D images could benefit surgeons.\n\nCave Automatic Virtual Environment\n\nThe first CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti in 1992. This is an immersive system that became the standard for rear projection-based Virtual Reality systems. The normal full system consists of projections screens along the front, side and floor axes, and a tracking system for the \"user\". Although they used the recursive acronym Cave Automatic Virtual Environment for the CAVE system, the name also refers to Plato's \"Republic\" and \"The Allegory of the Cave\" where he explored the concepts of reality and human perception.\n\nSince then there have been a couple offshoots of the CAVE technology, including ImmersaDesk, Infinity Wall and Oblong Industries' G-speak system.  The ImmersaDesk is a semi-immersive system, resembling a drafting table, while the Infinity Wall is designed to cater to an entire room of people, such as a conference room. Extending this concept, G-speak supports gestural input from multiple-users and multiple-devices on and expandable array of monitors.\n\nWorks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nDaniel Sandin @ EVL\n(art)n web site\nDaniel Sandin in the Video Data Bank\nDaniel Sandin at the Media Burn Independent Video Archive\n\n1942 births\nAmerican digital artists\nComputer graphics professionals\nLiving people\nAmerican video artists\nVirtual reality pioneers\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago faculty\nShimer College alumni", "machine_text": " Daniel J.

While noted for the feminist perspective in her writing, her reputation has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, and for assisting her second husband, convicted pedophile Walter H. Breen, to rape and abuse multiple unrelated children.\n\nBiography\nBorn Marion Eleanor Zimmer on June 3, 1930, she lived on a farm in Albany, New York, and began writing at the age of 17. She was married to Robert Alden Bradley from October 26, 1949 until their divorce on May 19, 1964. They had a son, David Robert Bradley (1950\u20132008). During the 1950s she was introduced to lesbian advocacy organization the Daughters of Bilitis.\n\nAfter her divorce, Bradley married numismatist  Walter H. Breen on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional harpist and singer, and a son, Mark Greyland. Moira's son, RJ Stern, is a college football player who was featured on season 5 of Last Chance U on Netflix.\n\nIn 1965, Bradley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. Afterward, she moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, with her brother Paul Edwin Zimmer, she helped found and name the Society for Creative Anachronism and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to Staten Island.\n\nBradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married, and continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on child molestation charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years. She had edited Breen's book Greek Love (published pseudonymously), which was dedicated to her (named simply as \"his wife\"), and in 1965 had contributed an article, \"Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature\", to Breen's journal The International Journal of Greek Love. She had known about Breen's sexual interests and previously accepted his sexual abuse of a 14-year-old boy.\n\nReligion\nWhile she was attending the College for Teachers (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, Bradley became involved in Western esoteric tradition. She later completed the Rosicrucian correspondence course.\n\nIn the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and Walter H. Breen founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of Dion Fortune. By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.\n\nBradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups. In 1981 Bradley, Diana L. Paxson, and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.\n\nIn the 1990s Bradley said she would return to Christianity, telling an interviewer: \"I just go regularly to the Episcopalian church ... That pagan thing ... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities.\"\n\nDeath\nAfter suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, England.\n\nChild sex abuse allegations\nIn 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of 3 to 12. In an email to The Guardian, Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because:\n\nGreyland also reported that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. Greyland is currently outspoken about her beliefs that her parents\u2019 homosexuality was the cause of their pedophilic tendencies. According to Greyland, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.\n\nAdditionally, according to Greyland, Bradley assisted Breen (her husband at the time) in accessing and abusing multiple unrelated young boys, knowing he was a pedophile who was engaging in sexual contact with children as young as eight. Greyland states that Bradley and her live-in female partner (whom Greyland refers to as her step-mother) both admitted to knowledge of the abuse and purposefully avoided investigating, questioning, or notifying any authorities. Bradley was also accused of attempting to adopt a child whom Breen was interested in sexually.\n\nIn response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, began donating all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. Janni Lee Simner donated advances and royalties from her two Darkover short stories and, at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\n\nAfter the allegations were made public, Greyland spoke at length about her experiences growing up and became active in speaking out against homosexual relationships and her beliefs in their negative affects on the nuclear family. A number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \"horrific\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote that Bradley's positive effect on her readers and associates \"makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\" G Willow Wilson, who along with Bradley is a fellow World Fantasy Award winner, said she was \"speechless\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother.\"\n\nLiterary career\nBradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, C.L. Moore, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about \"the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be\". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel The Forest House, her retelling of Norma; she finished it before her death.\n\nBradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in Amazing Stories in 1949 with the short story \"Outpost\". \"Outpost\" was published in Amazing Stories Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine Spacewarp Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948.  Her first professional publication was a short story \"Women Only\", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of Vortex Science Fiction in 1953. Her first published novel-length work was Falcons of Narabedla, first published in the May 1957 issue of Other Worlds.\n\nEarly in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels; I Am a Lesbian was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered pornographic when published.\n\nHer 1958 novel The Planet Savers introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a science fantasy fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.\nBradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned Amazing Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including Astra's Tower, Day*Star, and Anything Box. She also co-edited fanzines, including Ugly Bird with Redd Boggs, MEZRAB with her first husband Robert Bradley, and Allerlei with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including The Gorgon and The Nekromantikon. In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, she wrote two short fanfic stories about Arwen and published them in chapbook format. One story, \"The Jewel of Arwen\" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine I Palantir #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.\n\nIn 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the Society for Creative Anachronism and is credited with coining the name of that group.\n\nFor many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.\n\nBradley was the editor of the long-running Sword and Sorceress anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies.  Mercedes Lackey was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley, California. Bradley was editing the final Sword and Sorceress manuscript until the week of her death.\n\nHer most famous single novel may be The Mists of Avalon, a retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.\n\nBradley was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.\n\nBibliography\n\nNovels\n Falcons of Narabedla (1957)\n The Door Through Space (1961)\n Seven from the Stars (1961)\n The Colors of Space (1963)\n Castle Terror (1965)\n Souvenir of Monique (1967)\n Bluebeard's Daughter (1968)\n The Brass Dragon (1970)\n In the Steps of the Master \u2013 The Sixth Sense #2 (1973) (based on the television series The Sixth Sense, created by Anthony Lawrence)\n Hunters of the Red Moon (1973) (novelette)\n The Jewel of Arwen (1974) (novelette)\n The Parting of Arwen (1974) (novelette)\n Can Ellen Be Saved?

She was born in Albany, New York, and was best known for her work in the fields of fantasy and science fiction. Her most famous works included The Mists of Avalon, a retelling of the Arthurian legend, and Darkover, her series of science fiction novels set on an alien planet. Throughout her career, Bradley wrote more than one hundred works, including novels, short stories, poetry, and anthologies. She began writing science fiction and fantasy in the 1950s and her first novel was The Planet Savers, which was published in 1958. Her 1962 novel The Sword of Aldones, focused on the male protagonist, the Lord of Aldaran, and the first of what would ultimately become the Darkover universe. In addition to her writing career, Bradley was a major influence in the development of modern fantasy and science fiction fandom. She was active in the science fiction conventions of the 1950s and 1960s, and was a major participant in the development of the Society for Creative Anachronism. She also created her own publishing house, Marion Zimmer Bradley Books, to publish her own works as well as those of other authors. Bradley's works explored a wide range of themes, from gender and sexuality to antiquity and religion. She was known in particular for her focus on feminist themes, especially those involving the reinterpretation of ancient mythology from a feminist perspective. Many of her works, such as The Mists of Avalon, recast the traditional roles of women in mythology and fantasy. She was also a vocal advocate for civil rights and was a major contributor to the development of modern Paganism. Bradley's impact on the science fiction and fantasy genres is still felt today. She was a mentor to many younger authors, and her works remain popular, including several of her works being adapted into film, television, and theater. Her legacy is maintained by her daughter, Moira Greyland, who wrote a memoir detailing their complex and tumultuous relationship.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53210}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Only Fools and Horses\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Only Fools and Horses.... is a British television sitcom created and written by John Sullivan. Seven series were originally broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 1981 to 1991, with sixteen sporadic Christmas specials aired until the end of the show in 2003. Set in working-class Peckham in south-east London, it stars David Jason as ambitious market trader Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger brother Rodney Trotter, alongside a supporting cast. The series follows the Trotters' highs and lows in life, in particular their attempts to get rich. Critically and popularly acclaimed, the series received numerous awards, including recognition from BAFTA, the National Television Awards and the Royal Television Society, as well as winning individual accolades for both Sullivan and Jason. It was voted Britain's Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll. \n\nLennard Pearce appeared in the first three series as Del and Rodney's elderly grandad. After Pearce's death in 1984, the show replaced Grandad with Uncle Albert, the boys' great uncle, played by Buster Merryfield. From 1988 onwards, the show features regular characters in Del Boy and Rodney's love interests, Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively. Other recurring characters include car dealer Boycie (John Challis), road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray), Boycie's wife Marlene (Sue Holderness), and pub landlord Mike (Kenneth MacDonald).\n\nThe show was not an immediate hit with viewers and received little promotion early on, but later achieved consistently high ratings, and the 1996 episode \"Time on Our Hands\" (originally billed as the last episode) holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode, attracting 24.3 million viewers. The series influenced British culture, contributing several words and phrases to the English language. It spawned an extensive range of merchandise, including books, videos, DVDs, toys, and board games. Episodes are frequently repeated on UKTV comedy channel Gold.\n\nA spin-off series, The Green Green Grass, ran for four series in the UK from 2005 to 2009. A prequel, Rock & Chips, ran for three specials in 2010 and 2011. A special Sport Relief episode aired in March 2014, guest starring David Beckham. In July 2018, John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan, announced that a\nmusical adaptation of the show was nearing completion and launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.\n\nPlot \nDerek \"Del Boy\" Trotter (played by David Jason), a South London \"fly\" trader, lives in a council flat in a high-rise tower block, Nelson Mandela House, in Peckham, South London, with his much younger brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly grandad (Lennard Pearce). Their mother, Joan, died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded soon afterwards, so Del became Rodney's surrogate father and the family patriarch. Despite the difference in age, personality and outlook, the brothers share a constant bond throughout.\n\nThe situation focuses mainly on their attempts to become millionaires through questionable get-rich-quick schemes and by buying and selling poor-quality and illegal goods. They have a three-wheeled Reliant Regal van and trade under the name of Trotters Independent Traders, mainly on the black market.\n\nInitially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the only regulars, along with the occasional appearances of roadsweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and pretentious used car salesman Boycie (John Challis). Over time, the cast expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the local pub The Nag's Head. These included pub landlord Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), youthful spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) and Boycie's flirtatious wife Marlene (Sue Holderness). After Grandad died following the death of actor Lennard Pearce, his younger brother Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) emerged and moved in with Del and Rodney, becoming a main character. \n\nThe plots of many early episodes were primarily self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension in later series. Del and Rodney's quest for love is a recurring theme, which eventually resulted in them finding long-term love in the form of Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively; Del also has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben Smith). The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and then regain some of it.\n\nCast and characters\n\nMain cast and characters \n Derek Edward \"Del Boy\" Trotter (David Jason) \u2014 Del is a smooth-talking South London market trader, willing to sell anything to anyone to make money. Possessing a quick-wit and confidence that his younger brother mostly lacks, Del is devoted to his family, taking care of Rodney and Grandad on his own from the age of 16. Del is also known for his penchant for cultural faux pas, in particular his misuse of French phrases. Del never settled down with a woman until he met Raquel, with whom he had a son, Damien.\nSullivan recalled that he had always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. At the time, Broadbent was appearing in Mike Leigh's play, \"Goose-Pimples\", at the Hampstead Theatre in north London. The play was due to transfer to the West End, and consequently, Broadbent thought he would be unable to fit in with the filming schedule and turned down the part. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst did not look like brothers, he was cast.\n\n Rodney Charlton Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst) \u2014 Rodney is Del's idealistic but socially awkward younger half-brother. Despite being more academically gifted than Del Boy (although only to the extent of two GCEs), Rodney lacks Del's charisma as well as the latter's duplicitous persona and as such is confined to being Del's dogsbody and sidekick. Orphaned when young, Rodney was raised by Del, and much of the friction between the two comes from Rodney's annoyance about his dependency on his brother and his sometimes immoral schemes, usually resulting in unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or through setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father. In contrast to Del, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences: he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.\n Edward Kitchener \"Grandad\" Trotter (Lennard Pearce) \u2014 Sullivan was fascinated by the idea of having a big age gap between Del Boy and his younger brother Rodney; the elderly character of Grandad, and later, Uncle Albert, gave the situation the voice of an old man who had seen it all. In casting the role of Grandad, Sullivan had in mind an actor similar to Wilfrid Brambell, who had played Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, but chose not to use Brambell himself, thinking him too closely associated with Steptoe. After seeing Pearce's audition, Sullivan chose him immediately. Unkempt and absent-minded, although sometimes displaying a high intelligence, Grandad rarely left the flat or even moved from his armchair in front of two television sets. Despite his age he was invariably treated as a butler by Del and Rodney, often being assigned unsavoury jobs around the flat such as cooking meals. Pearce died in 1984 whilst filming the series four episode \"Hole in One\" (several scenes were subsequently re-shot with Buster Merryfield) and Sullivan wrote a new episode, \"Strained Relations\", which featured Grandad's funeral.\n Albert Gladstone Trotter (Buster Merryfield) \u2014 Shortly after the death of Lennard Pearce, it was decided that a new older family member should be brought in, which eventually led to \"Uncle Albert\", Grandad's estranged younger brother. Merryfield was an inexperienced amateur actor at the time, but was selected because he appeared to fit the description of an old sailor, especially with his distinctive white \"Captain Birdseye\" beard. Albert first appeared at Grandad's funeral, and soon moved in with Del and Rodney. His wartime experiences with the Royal Navy became one of the show's running gags, usually beginning with the words \"During the war...\". Merryfield died in 1999 and Albert's death was written into the next episode.\n Raquel Turner (Tessa Peake-Jones) \u2014 Raquel was introduced because Sullivan wanted more female characters and for Del to start meeting more mature women. Her first appearance, in \"Dates\", was intended to be a one-off, but she was written in again a year later and thereafter became a permanent cast member. A trained singer and actress whose career never took off, she met Del through a dating agency, but they fell out over her part-time job as a stripper, before getting together again. This time she moved in with Del, helping to calm him, and they had a son together, named Damien. As the character unfolded, it was revealed that she was previously married to Del's rival, DCI Roy Slater.\n Cassandra Trotter (n\u00e9e Parry) (Gwyneth Strong) \u2014 Cassandra first met Rodney in \"Yuppy Love\". Their relationship blossomed, and by the end of series six the two had married. Cassandra's career-driven lifestyle caused fights with Rodney, and their troubled marriage was one of the main storylines later in the show's run.\n\nSupporting cast and characters \n Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) \u2014 A dopey and slow-witted but good friend of Del, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the \"village idiot\" role, and constantly calls Rodney \"Dave\", much to Rodney's chagrin. Trigger, apparently so called because he looks like a horse, was the principal supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd-Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray.\n\n Boycie (John Challis) \u2014 An untrustworthy used car salesman and a cultural elitist. Boycie, a freemason, was very selfish and prone to boasting about his wealth. Challis had played a similar character in an episode of Citizen Smith. Sullivan liked him, and promised to cast him in a future series, which led to Boycie. Boycie later featured in a spin-off series, The Green Green Grass, starting in 2005, in which he and his wife Marlene escaped from a criminal gang.\n Denzil Tulser (Paul Barber) \u2014 An affable Liverpudlian lorry driver, Denzil was often on the victim of Del's scams. His inability to say no to Del's business deals frequently led to arguments with his controlling wife, Corinne (Eva Mottley), who was only sighted once, in \"Who's a Pretty Boy?\". Corinne eventually walked out on him, leaving Denzil depressed but with more time to go along with Del's antics.\n Sid (Roy Heather) \u2014 Sid made sparse appearances throughout the show's run, mainly as the proprietor of the dirty and derelict local cafe. In the episode \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\", it is revealed that Sid fought in the Second World War. He was captured and imprisoned but escaped, only for the boat he was using to be hit and sunk by a Greek fishing trawler being steered by Uncle Albert. After Nag's Head landlord Mike was imprisoned, Sid took over and kept that role for the remainder of the series.\n Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) \u2014 Mickey was a young, arrogant spiv and friend of Rodney's, known for his exaggerated boasts about his success in business or with women. Despite their friendship, Mickey often took advantage of Rodney's inexperience by stealing his girlfriends or making off with all the money from their business partnership.\n Marlene Boyce (Sue Holderness) \u2014 Boycie's wife. Initially just an unseen character, Marlene was popular among the boys and extremely flirtatious, having had implied sexual relations with all of Boycie's friends. She and Del have a noticeably close friendship, dating back to when Marlene worked in a betting shop in Lewisham Grove. Despite their constant arguments and insults, she and Boycie are in-love and eventually have a child, Tyler, although there are light-hearted rumours that Del may be the father.\n Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald) \u2014 The landlord of the Nag's Head, although not from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service. Friendly and gormless, he was often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any goods he was selling. When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, a storyline involving Mike's imprisonment for attempting to embezzle the brewery was written, and cafe owner Sid took over as the interim pub landlord.\n Damien Trotter (various) \u2014 Damien was Del and Raquel's son. It was Rodney's mocking suggestion that he be named Damien. Six actors played Damien: Patrick McManus (1991), Grant Stevens (1991), Robert Liddement (1992), Jamie Smith (1993\u201396), Douglas Hodge (1996, as adult), and Ben Smith (2001\u201303).\n\nMinor cast and characters \n\nThe most frequent roles for guest actors in Only Fools and Horses were as Del or Rodney's once-seen girlfriends, barmaids at the Nag's Head, or individuals the Trotters were doing business with. Del and Rodney's deceased mother, Joan, though never seen, cropped up in Del's embellished accounts of her final words or in his attempts to emotionally blackmail Rodney. Her grave \u2013 a flamboyant monument \u2013 was seen occasionally. Their absent father, Reg, appeared once in \"Thicker Than Water\" (played by Peter Woodthorpe), before leaving under a cloud, never to be seen again.  Other members of the Trotter family were rarely sighted, the exceptions being cousins Stan (Mike Kemp) and Jean  (Maureen Sweeney), who attended Grandad's funeral. In \"The Second Time Around\", the woman they believed to be Auntie Rose (Beryl Cooke) turned out to be no relation at all but the woman who had moved into Rose's house some years earlier. After Rodney met Cassandra, her parents Alan (Denis Lill) and Pam (Wanda Ventham) became recurring characters. Raquel's parents, James and Audrey (Michael Jayston and Ann Lynn), appeared in \"Time On Our Hands\", and it was James who discovered the antique watch which made the Trotters millionaires.\n\nIn some episodes, a guest character was essential to the plot. Del's ex-fianc\u00e9e Pauline (Jill Baker) dominated Del's libido in \"The Second Time Around\", prompting Rodney and Grandad to leave. In \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", Del's old business partner Jumbo Mills (Nick Stringer) wanted Del to return to Australia with him and restore their partnership, forcing Del to make a decision. An attempt by Lennox (Vas Blackwood) to rob a local supermarket set-up the \"hostage\" situation in \"The Longest Night\". Del and Rodney spent the whole of \"Tea for Three\" battling each other for the affections of Trigger's niece Lisa (Gerry Cowper), who briefly reappeared in \"The Frog's Legacy\". Abdul (Tony Anholt) in \"To Hull and Back\" and Arnie (Philip McGough) in \"Chain Gang\" were responsible for setting up dubious enterprises involving the Trotters in their respective episodes. Tony Angelino (Philip Pope), the singing dustman with a speech impediment, was the key to the humour and the storyline of \"Stage Fright\" and EastEnders actor Derek Martin guest starred in \"Fatal Extraction\".\n\nDel's nemesis from his school days, corrupt policeman DCI Roy Slater (played by Jim Broadbent), made three appearances, in \"May The Force Be With You\", \"To Hull and Back\" and \"Class of '62\". Feared local villains, the Driscoll Brothers (Roy Marsden and Christopher Ryan) featured once, in \"Little Problems\", but were mentioned in two previous episodes (\"Video Nasty\" and \"The Frog's Legacy\"), and are important in the story of The Green Green Grass. A grown-up Damien (Douglas Hodge) appeared in \"Heroes and Villains\". Rodney and Mickey's friends, the smooth-talking Jevon (Steven Woodcock) and then, briefly, Chris (Tony Marshall), a ladies' hairdresser, featured sporadically during the sixth and seventh series and the intervening Christmas specials. The two-part 1991 Christmas special, \"Miami Twice\", saw Richard Branson and Barry Gibb make cameo appearances. Mike Read appeared as himself, hosting an episode of Top Of The Pops, in \"It's Only Rock and Roll\" and Jonathan Ross appeared as himself in \"If They Could See Us Now\".\n\nWhile their characters were less significant, well-known actors who played cameos in the programme included Joan Sims, best known for her numerous roles in the Carry On films, who guest-starred in the feature-length episode \"The Frog's Legacy\" as an aunt of Trigger and old friend of Del's late mother; successful film actor David Thewlis, who played a young wannabe musician in \"It's Only Rock and Roll\"; John Bardon, who played the role of Jim Branning in the soap opera EastEnders, as the supermarket security officer in \"The Longest Night\". Walter Sparrow, who appeared as Dirty Barry in \"Danger UXD\", went on to appear in several Hollywood films.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \n\nIn 1980, John Sullivan, a scriptwriter under contract at the BBC, was already well known as the writer of the sitcom Citizen Smith. It came to an end that year and Sullivan was searching for a new project. An initial idea for a comedy set in the world of football was rejected by the BBC, as was his alternative idea, a sitcom centring on a cockney market trader in working class, modern-day London. The latter idea persisted. Through Ray Butt, a BBC producer and director whom Sullivan had met and become friends with when they were working on Citizen Smith, a draft script was shown to the BBC's Head of Comedy, John Howard Davies. Davies commissioned Sullivan to write a full series. Sullivan believed the key factor in its being accepted was the success of ITV's new drama, Minder, a series with a similar premise and also set in modern-day London.\n\nSullivan had initially given the show the working title Readies. For the actual title he intended to use, as a reference to the protagonist's tax and work-evading lifestyle, Only Fools and Horses. That name was based on a genuine, though very obscure, saying, \"only fools and horses work for a living\", which had its origins in 19th-century American vaudeville. Only Fools and Horses had also been the title of an episode of Citizen Smith, and Sullivan liked the expression and thought it was suited to the new sitcom. He also thought longer titles would attract attention. He was first overruled on the grounds that the audience would not understand the title, but he eventually got his way.\n\nFilming and transmission \n\nFilming of the first series began in May 1981, and the first episode, \"Big Brother\", was transmitted on BBC One at 8.30 pm on 8 September that year. It attracted 9.2\u00a0million viewers and generally received a lukewarm response from critics. The viewing figures for the whole first series averaged at around 7\u00a0million viewers. According to an interview with John Challis in 2015, the viewing figure \"today would be very good but in those days wasn't considered great at all, so it was sort of put on the back burner for a bit \u2013 no particular plans for a second series\". The costumes for the first series were designed by Phoebe De Gaye. Del's attire was inspired by her going to car boot sales. She took Jason shopping in Oxford Street, and had him try a variety of suits. De Gaye purchased some gaily coloured Gabicci shirts, which were fashionable at the time and she thought \"horrible\". Del's rings and bracelet were made of fake gold and came from Chapel Market. Rodney's combat jacket came from the BBC's Costume Department, and De Gaye added a Yasser Arafat scarf purchased from Shepherd's Bush Market. De Gaye used Vaseline, make-up, and food to make Grandad's costume look dirty. The idea was that he never had his hat off, never dressed properly and usually had dirty pyjamas underneath his clothes.\n\nA second series was commissioned for 1982. This fared a bit better, and the first and second series had a collective repeat run in June 1983 in a more low-key time slot, but attracted a high enough viewing figure for Davies to commission a third series. From there, the show began to top the television ratings. Viewing figures for the fourth series were double those of the first. In early December 1984, during the filming of Series 4, Lennard Pearce suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital. He died on 15 December, the day before he was due to return. Sullivan wrote Grandad's death into the series with the episode \"Strained Relations\" which featured Del and Rodney's goodbye to Grandad. According to Sullivan, recasting Grandad was considered disrespectful to Pearce by the team, so it was decided that another older family member was to be cast. Buster Merryfield was then cast as Grandad's brother Albert. The scenes from \"Hole in One\" that featured Pearce were re-filmed with Merryfield.\n\nMidway through the filming of the fifth series, Jason told Sullivan that he wished to leave the show in order to further his career elsewhere. Sullivan thus wrote \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", which was intended to be the final episode and would see Del accepting a friend's offer to set up business in Australia, leaving Rodney and Albert behind. Plans were made for a spin-off entitled Hot-Rod, which would have followed Rodney's attempts to survive on his own with help from Mickey Pearce, but leaving open the prospect of Del's return. Jason then changed his mind, and the ending of the episode was changed to show Del rejecting the offer.\n\nSullivan had a tendency to write scripts that were too long, meaning a lot of good material had to be cut. Shortly before filming of the sixth series began, he and Jason requested that the show's time slot be extended and it was agreed to extend its running time to 50 minutes. This required a 40 per cent increase in the show's budget, and coincided with the show's becoming one of the BBC's most popular programmes. Robin Stubbs became the costume designer for the sixth series, and was responsible for getting Del's attire to match his new yuppy image. His new suits cost around \u00a3200 each and were purchased from Austin Reed in Regent Street. The rest came from stores such as Tie-Rack and Dickins & Jones. His jewellery was replaced each series because it was very cheap (the rings with \"D\" cost 50p each).\n\nThe seventh series aired in early 1991. Jason and Sullivan were involved with other projects, and it was confirmed that there were no plans for a new series. Despite this, the show continued in Christmas specials until 1993. Sullivan nonetheless wanted a final episode to tie up the show. In late 1996, three more one-hour episodes were filmed, to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received and, due to the ending, were assumed to be the last. The show made a return in Christmas 2001 with the first of three new episodes which were shot together but ultimately broadcast over three consecutive Christmases from 2001 until 2003. Despite rumours of further episodes, in a 2008 interview, Sullivan was quoted as saying: \"There will not be another series of Only Fools And Horses. I can say that. We had our day, it was wonderful but it is best to leave it now\". Though Sullivan died in 2011, it returned for a special Sport Relief episode in 2014.\n\nTheme music and titles \n\nOnly Fools and Horses has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits, \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Hooky Street\", respectively. The original theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue, and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show's title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden, and Proctor. Sullivan had intended Chas & Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the \"Rockney\" style, a mixture of rock n' roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not \u2013 as is sometimes thought \u2013 by Nicholas Lyndhurst.\n\nThe opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer Peter Clayton as a \"metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle\", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. Clayton had also considered using five-pound notes bearing Del's face. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete. Clayton knew that it was important to have the characters established in the titles, and prepared a storyboard depicting his ideas using drawings. He photographed various locations with a photographer, and the titles were shot using a rostrum camera and not edited. Brian Stephens, a professional animator, was hired to create the labels' movement.\n\nClayton returned to the show when the closing credits were changed for \"Christmas Crackers\". He re-cut the entire sequence and added Christmas items. Another change was made necessary by Lennard Pearce's death and Buster Merryfield joining the cast, so the pictures of David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst were updated too. The sequence was shot on motor drive.\n\nThe closing credits for the programme varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring the names of the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series the credits switched to a standard rolling format. The third series featured additional symbols. For the fourth series, these designs were replaced with white lettering on a black background. The fifth series had a black and white background, but the sixth series reverted to the black one. For the seventh series, the credits scrolled against a freeze frame of the final scene.\n\nFilming locations \nThe original \"Nelson Mandela House\" in the titles was Harlech Tower, Park Road East, Acton, London. From 1988 onwards, Whitemead House, Duckmoor Road, Ashton in Bristol was used. The tower block is located behind Ashton Gate, the home ground of Bristol City Football Club, with some scenes filmed in the stadium's carpark.\n\nEpisodes \n\nSixty-four episodes of Only Fools and Horses, all written by John Sullivan, were broadcast on BBC1 from 8 September 1981 until 25 December 2003. The show was aired in seven series (1981\u20131983, 1985\u20131986, 1989 and 1990\u20131991), and thereafter in sporadic Christmas special editions (1991\u20131993, 1996, 2001\u20132003). All earlier episodes had a running time of 30 minutes, but this was extended after Series Six (1989), and all subsequent episodes had a running time ranging from 50 to 95 minutes.\n\nSeveral mini-episodes were produced. An eight-minute episode aired on 27 December 1982 as part of a show hosted by Frank Muir, The Funny Side of Christmas, and attracted 7.2 million viewers. A 5-minute spoof BBC documentary was shown on Breakfast Time on 24 December 1985, with Del being investigated by a BBC consumer expert. An educational episode named \"Licensed to Drill\", in which Del, Rodney and Grandad discuss oil drilling, was recorded in 1984 but only shown in schools. A 5-minute 1990\u201391 Persian Gulf War special (dated 1 December 1990) has Del, Rodney, and Albert convey a message to British troops serving in the conflict. It has never been broadcast commercially, but a copy exists at the Imperial War Museum, London. A Comic Relief special showing Del, Rodney and Albert making an appeal for donations was shown on 14 March 1997, with 10.6 million viewers. A Sport Relief special was aired on 21 March 2014.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses had two producers: Ray Butt from 1981 to 1987, and Gareth Gwenlan thereafter. Seven directors were used: Martin Shardlow directed all episodes in series one, Bernard Thompson directed the 1981 Christmas special, Susan Belbin series four, and Mandie Fletcher series five. Butt directed series three and five, as well as the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Christmas specials. Tony Dow became the established director after 1988, directing all subsequent episodes, bar the first part of Miami Twice, which was directed by Gareth Gwenlan. John Sullivan was executive producer on seven of the final eight episodes.\n\nDocumentaries \nA BBC documentary titled \"The Story of Only Fools and Horses\" aired in December 2002. A six-part documentary series also titled \"The Story of Only Fools and Horses\", began on 29 August 2017 on Gold and finished on 3 October 2017. The series features rare and unseen footage from the archives and specially re-created moments from Del Boy's family and friends. On 27 December 2020, a special called \"We Love Only Fools and Horses\" was broadcast on Channel 5 in which various fans, actors and crew recalled the story of the series and why the show is still popular.\n\nSpin-offs\n\nThe Green Green Grass \nA spin-off of Only Fools and Horses entitled The Green Green Grass, also written by John Sullivan and directed by Tony Dow, was first aired in the UK in September 2005. Sullivan had considered writing a sitcom around the popular characters of Boycie and Marlene (John Challis and Sue Holderness) since the mid-1980s, but it was not until the series finally ended that the idea came to fruition. The Green Green Grass saw Boycie and Marlene forced to leave Peckham by one-time Only Fools and Horses villains, the Driscoll Brothers, and included guest appearances by Denzil (Paul Barber) and Sid (Roy Heather). A second series of The Green Green Grass was broadcast in the UK in October 2006, a third in November 2007 and a fourth in January 2009.\n\nRock & Chips \nIn 2003, it was reported that Sullivan was developing a prequel to the original series, Once Upon a Time in Peckham, which would feature Del as a youngster in the 1960s, and have a prominent role for his parents. In 2009, it was again reported that the BBC were considering commissioning the show, although nothing was confirmed. On 5 April 2009, Sullivan said that he was planning a prequel to Only Fools and Horses which would star Nicholas Lyndhurst as Freddie \"The Frog\" Robdal, a local criminal and Rodney's biological father; Robdal was the focus of the episode \"The Frog's Legacy\".\n\nOn 3 July 2009, the BBC revealed that the title of the spin-off would be Sex, Drugs & Rock \u2018n\u2019 Chips, and would be a 90-minute comedy drama. The title was subsequently changed to Rock & Chips. Filming began in August 2009, and it was shown on BBC One at 9pm on 24 January 2010. In October 2009 it was confirmed that Lyndhurst would star as Robdal. The Inbetweeners and Off The Hook actor James Buckley played the role of the young Del Boy.\n\nHome media \nThe show has been released on VHS, DVD and audio CD in several guises. A DVD collection containing every episode was issued, along with various other special edition box-sets, such as a tin based on their Reliant Regal. Videos and DVDs of Only Fools and Horses continue to be among the BBC's biggest-selling items, having sold over 1\u00a0million VHS copies and 6\u00a0million DVD copies in the UK.\n\nThe series made its debut on Blu-ray on 6 December 2021, with a three-disc set entitled Only Fools and Horses: The 80s Specials. It featured the five feature length Christmas specials broadcast from 1985 to 1989, restored and remastered in high-definition. For the restoration process, the original 16mm film elements were cleaned and rescanned, while the standard-definition videotape elements were \"digitally reprocessed\" and upscaled to HD. On the set, the episode \"A Royal Flush\" is featured both in its original and \"writer's cut\" versions; previously unreleased footage from \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\" is included; and various photo galleries, a booklet and artcards are also included.\n\nIn other media\n\nAudio \nFour episodes (\"The Long Legs of the Law\", \"A Losing Streak\", \"No Greater Love\" and \"The Yellow Peril\") were re-edited for audio purposes and released on audio cassette on 12 October 1998. The cassette was re-released in October 2000.\n\nTheatre \nA four-minute show named \"Royal Variety Performance\" was shown on 27 November 1988 (viewed by 18.14 million people) and had Del, Rodney, and Albert appear on the Royal Variety Show. It was staged on 24 November 1986, and the plot saw David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst and Buster Merryfield appear on stage in character, thinking that they are delivering boxes of alcohol to an associate of Del's, only later realising where they actually are. They also mistake the Duchess of York for Del's associate.\n\nAn idea of an Only Fools and Horses stage show was mooted by Ray Butt, following the success of other sitcom crossovers such as Dad's Army and Are You Being Served?. Sullivan was not keen, owing to his work on Just Good Friends as well as Only Fools and Horses, and inexperience with the theatre, so nothing came of it.\n\nStage musical \n\nIn July 2018, John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan, announced that an Only Fools and Horses musical was nearing completion, with a script by Jim Sullivan and Paul Whitehouse. Jim Sullivan said, \"Back in 2010 my Dad had been toying with the possibility of a stage show but sadly didn\u2019t get the chance to commit to it. In 2015 we met with the producer, Phil McIntyre, and agreed to develop the idea.  Soon after that, Paul Whitehouse came on board and things have been bubbling away ever since. I am very pleased and excited to say that the show will be launching early next year.\" The musical launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.\n\nBooks \nOnly Fools and Horses spawned many merchandising spin-offs. Several books have been published, such as \"The Only Fools and Horses Story\" by Steve Clark and \"The Complete A-Z of Only Fools and Horses\" by Richard Webber, both of which detail the history of the series. The scripts have been published in a three-volume compendium, \"The Bible of Peckham\".\n\nIn October 2015, He Who Dares..., a fictional autobiography, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan.\n\nIn August 2017, Only Fools and Horses: The Peckham Archives, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by Rod Green, with the help of Jim Sullivan.\n\nIn November 2018, You Know It Makes Sense, Lessons From The Derek Trotter School of Business (And Life), was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan.\n\nBoard games \nTwo board games based on the show were released: a Monopoly-style game, the \"Trotters Trading Game\", in which participants attempt to emulate the Trotters and become millionaires, and another game set in their local pub, entitled the \"Nag's Head Board Game\".\n\nReception \n\nOnly Fools and Horses is one of the UK's most popular sitcoms. It was among the ten most-watched television shows of the year in the UK in 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 1996 Christmas trilogy of \"Heroes and Villains\", \"Modern Men\" and \"Time on Our Hands\" saw the show's peak. The first two attracted 21.3\u00a0million viewers, while the third episode \u2013 at the time believed to be the final one \u2013 got 24.3\u00a0million, a record audience for a British sitcom. Repeat episodes also attract millions of viewers, and the BBC has received criticism for repeating the show too often.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses won the BAFTA award for best comedy series in 1985, 1988 and 1996, was nominated in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1990 and 1991, and won the audience award in 2004. David Jason received individual BAFTAs for his portrayal of Del Boy in 1990 and 1996. The series won a National Television Award in 1997 for most popular comedy series; Jason won two individual awards, in 1997 and 2002. At the British Comedy Awards, the show was named best BBC sitcom for 1990, and received the People's Choice award in 1997. It also won the Royal Television Society best comedy award in 1997 and two Television and Radio Industries Club Awards for comedy programme of the year, in 1984 and 1997. John Sullivan received the Writers' Guild of Great Britain comedy award in 1997.\n\nThe show regularly features in polls to find the most popular comedy series, moments and characters. It was voted Britain's Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll,\nand came 45th in the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. It was 3rd on a subsequent viewers' poll on the BFI website. Empire magazine ranked Only Fools and Horses #42 on their list of the 50 greatest television shows of all time. It was also named the funniest British sitcom of all time through a scientific formula, in a study by Gold. Scenes such as Del Boy's fall through a bar flap in \"Yuppy Love\" and the Trotters accidentally smashing a priceless chandelier in \"A Touch of Glass\" are recognisable comedy moments, invariably topping polls of comedy viewers. Del Boy was voted the most popular British TV character of all time in a survey by Open.... and in a 2001 Channel 4 poll he ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. A Onepoll survey found that Only Fools and Horses was the television series Britons would most like to see return.\n\nRatings\n\nCultural impact \n\nIn addition to its mainstream popularity, Only Fools and Horses has developed a cult following. The Only Fools and Horses Appreciation Society, established in 1993, has a membership of around 7,000, publishes a quarterly newsletter, Hookie Street, and organises annual conventions of fans, usually attended by cast members. The Society has also organised an Only Fools and Horses museum, containing props from the series, including Del's camel coat and the Trotters' Ford Capri. It was named one of the top 20 cult television programmes of all-time by TV critic Jeff Evans. Evans spoke of:\n\nOnly Fools and Horses \u2013 and consequently John Sullivan \u2013 is credited with the popularisation in Britain of several words and phrases used by Del Boy, particularly\n\"Plonker\", meaning a fool or an idiot, and two expressions of delight or approval: \"Cushty\" (from the Roma word for \"good\")  and \"Lovely jubbly\". The latter was borrowed from an advertising slogan for a popular 1960s orange juice drink, called Jubbly, which was packaged in a pyramid shaped, waxed paper carton. Sullivan remembered it and thought it was an expression Del Boy would use; in 2003, the phrase was incorporated into the new Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nOwing to its exposure on Only Fools and Horses, the Reliant Regal van is often linked with the show in the British media. The one used by the Trotters has attained cult status and is currently on display at the Cars of the Stars exhibition at the National Motor Museum, alongside many other vehicles from British and American television and movies, such as the Batmobile and the DeLorean from Back to the Future. Boxer Ricky Hatton, a fan of the show, purchased one of the original vans in 2004. Another of the vans used in the series was sold at auction in the UK for \u00a344,000 in February 2007.\n\nDuring the media frenzy surrounding The Independent'''s revelations that the new bottled water Dasani, marketed by Coca-Cola, was in fact just purified tap water from Sidcup, mocking parallels were made with the Only Fools and Horses episode, \"Mother Nature's Son\", in which Del sells tap water as \"Peckham Spring\".\n\nRose Tyler's father Pete Tyler is referred to as \"a bit of a Del Boy\" in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"Father's Day\".\n\nIn the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, the Trotters' yellow Reliant van appeared on stage, along with Del Boy and Rodney body doubles dressed as Batman and Robin, a reference to the Only Fools and Horses episode \"Heroes and Villains\".\n\n International remakes Only Fools and Horses was sold to countries throughout the world. Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Yugoslavia are among those who purchased it. In all former Yugoslav countries in which Serbian or Croatian is spoken the title was Mu\u0107ke (or \u041c\u0443\u045b\u043a\u0435 in Cyrillic script), which can roughly be translated as \"shady deals\". This translation was also used in Macedonia, where the show was titled Spletki (\u0421\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 in Cyrillic). In Slovenia, however, the show was titled Samo bedaki in konji, which is a literal Slovenian translation of the original English title. The show has enjoyed particular popularity in the former Yugoslavia, and is regarded as a cult series in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.\n\nA number of overseas re-makes have also been produced. A Dutch version aired for one series in 1995, entitled Wat schuift't? (\"What's it good for?\"). The Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans and it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Grandad and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on RTL 4. A Portuguese re-make, O Fura-Vidas, a local expression for someone who lives outside the law, ran for three series from 1999 to 2001. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals. It centred on the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in Lisbon, and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney). In this Portuguese version the Reliant's equivalent was a 1988 Suzuki Super Carry. A Slovenian re-make, called Brat bratu (Brother to Brother), was broadcast from 2008 to 2009. All episodes were based on the original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with John Sullivan. It featured brothers Brane (Brane \u0160turbej) and Bine (Jure Dreven\u0161ek), who moved from Maribor to Ljubljana. The series also stars Peter Ternov\u0161ek as Grandad. It was directed by Branko \u0110uri\u0107. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor ratings.\n\nThere have been several plans to produce an American version. One was to be a star vehicle for former M*A*S*H actor Harry Morgan, with Grandad rather than Del becoming the lead character. The other, entitled This Time Next Year..., would have seen the Trotters renamed the Flannagans. A draft script was written for the latter, but neither show materialised. In 2010 Steve Carell, star of the US version of The Office, expressed an interest in making an American version of the series, with him to star as Del Boy.

The show ran from 1981 to 2003 and had a total of 64 episodes. Set in the rough part of London known as Peckham, it follows the stories of two ambitious but down-on-their-luck brothers, Rodney and Del Boy Trotter, as they attempt various get-rich-quick scams and schemes, and navigate a world of colorful characters. The show was popular with not only the British viewing public, but also in other parts of the world. It was the most watched television show in the UK at its peak, with over 24 million viewers tuning in for its final episode. It was also a hit overseas, in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, and other countries. The show stars David Jason as Del Boy, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney, and Lennard Pearce as Grandad. Many of the characters also had recurring roles, such as Boycie (John Challis), Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), Denzil (Paul Barber), and Rodney's so-called better half, Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong). The Trotters' main plight throughout the series is to become millionaires. As Del Boy often puts it, they \"make a profit out of thin air\" and have been doing so since the pilot episode. However, their plans usually come crashing down in the end, leading to a hilarious finale that often closes with the catchphrase \"This time next year, we'll be millionaires!\". Throughout its run, Only Fools and Horses received many awards, including Best Comedy Series at the 1998 British Comedy Awards. The entire series was released on DVD in the UK in 2006. Despite ending in 2003, the show still lives on in popular culture. Merchandise featuring the show's logo and characters are still being produced and sold today. The show also received a spinoff series in the form of the prequel Rock & Chips in 2010. Only Fools and Horses is a classic laugh-out-loud sitcom that is truly timeless. With its endearing characters, memorable quotes, and heartwarming plots, the show continues to bring joy to millions of viewers around the world, and will continue to do so for generations to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 200842}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Earth's rotation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Earth's rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris, Earth turns counterclockwise.\n\nThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.\n\nEarth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend; the length of a day increased about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE. Scientists reported that in 2020 Earth has started spinning faster, after consistently spinning slower than 86,400 seconds per day in the decades before. Because of that, engineers worldwide are discussing a 'negative leap second' and other possible timekeeping measures.\n\nHistory\nAmong the ancient Greeks, several of the Pythagorean school believed in the rotation of Earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470\u2013385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.\n\nA more conventional picture was supported by Hicetas, Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that Earth rotated but did not suggest that Earth revolved about the Sun. In the third century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos suggested the Sun's central place.\n\nHowever, Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about Earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought Earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.\n\nIn 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata suggested that the spherical Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of Earth. He provided the following analogy: \"Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward.\"\n\nIn the 10th century, some Muslim astronomers accepted that Earth rotates around its axis. According to al-Biruni, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020) invented an astrolabe called al-z\u016braq\u012b based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries \"that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.\" The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: \"According to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandis\u012bn), the Earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the Earth and not the stars.\" Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it. At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.\n\nIn medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view and so, reluctantly, did John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of Earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of Earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central Sun.\n\nTycho Brahe, who produced accurate observations on which Kepler based his laws of planetary motion, used Copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary Earth. In 1600, William Gilbert strongly supported Earth's rotation in his treatise on Earth's magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries. Those like Gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of Earth about the Sun are called \"semi-Copernicans\". A century after Copernicus, Riccioli disputed the model of a rotating Earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies; such deflections would later be called the Coriolis effect. However, the contributions of Kepler, Galileo and Newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of Earth.\n\nEmpirical tests\nEarth's rotation implies that the Equator bulges and the geographical poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the pendulum measurements taken by Richer in 1673 as corroboration of the change in gravity, but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the oblateness of Earth, thus confirming the positions of both Newton and Copernicus.\n\nIn Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the Northern Hemisphere (and left in the Southern) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of cyclone rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and clockwise, respectively).\n\nHooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of , but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in Bologna, Johann Friedrich Benzenberg in Hamburg and Ferdinand Reich in Freiberg, using taller towers and carefully released weights. A ball dropped from a height of 158.5\u00a0m departed by 27.4\u00a0mm from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1\u00a0mm.\n\nThe most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist L\u00e9on Foucault in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended  from the top of the Panth\u00e9on in Paris. Because of Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about  clockwise per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world.\n\nPeriods\n\nTrue solar day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun (solar noon to solar noon) is its true solar day or apparent solar day. It depends on Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two. The true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the Sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual, taking about  longer to do so. Conversely, it is about  shorter near aphelion. It is about  longer near a solstice when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about . Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near  by  solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near  when it is only  longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near  and  by  and , respectively.\n\nMean solar day\n\nThe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day, which contains . Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than . Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.\n\nThe apparent solar time is a measure of Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.\n\nStellar and sidereal day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the International Celestial Reference Frame, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is  seconds of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing mean vernal equinox, named sidereal day, is  of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about .\n\nBoth the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about  . This is a result of the Earth turning 1 additional rotation, relative to the celestial reference frame, as it orbits the Sun (so 366.25 rotations/y). The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods  and .\n\nRecently (1999\u20132010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of  has varied between  and , which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see Fluctuations in the length of day).\n\nAngular speed\n\nThe angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is  \u00b1 . Multiplying by (180\u00b0/\u03c0 radians) \u00d7 (86,400 seconds/day) yields , indicating that Earth rotates more than 360\u00b0 relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360\u00b0) relative to the mean Sun. Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of  (WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2\u03c0 radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of . Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or . This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by . However, the use of the solar day is incorrect; it must be the sidereal day, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, , which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4\u00a0km/h.\n\nThe tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude. For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at latitude 28.59\u00b0 N, which yields a speed of: cos(28.59\u00b0) \u00d7 1674.4\u00a0km/h = 1470.2\u00a0km/h. Latitude is a placement consideration for spaceports.\n\nThe peak of the Cayambe volcano is the point of Earth's surface farthest from its axis; thus, it rotates the fastest as Earth spins.\n\nChanges\n\nIn rotational axis \n\nEarth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and nutation. It also moves with respect to Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.\n\nPrecession is a rotation of Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the Chandler wobble.\n\nIn rotational speed\n\nTidal interactions \nOver millions of years, Earth's rotation has been slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the Moon. Thus angular momentum is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to , where  is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process has gradually increased the length of the day to its current value, and resulted in the Moon being tidally locked with Earth.\n\nThis gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented by estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites; a compilation of these measurements found that the length of the day has increased steadily from about 21 hours at 600 Myr ago to the current 24-hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.\n\nResonant stabilization \n\nThe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600 Myr ago. Some models suggest that Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the Precambrian. This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600 Myr ago; the simulated results agree quite closely with existing paleorotational data.\n\nGlobal events \n\nSome recent large-scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by reducing Earth's moment of inertia. Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is also changing the distribution of Earth's mass, thus affecting the moment of inertia of Earth and, by the conservation of angular momentum, Earth's rotation period.\n\nThe length of the day can also be influenced by manmade structures. For example, NASA scientists calculated that the water stored in the Three Gorges Dam has increased the length of Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds due to the shift in mass.\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe primary monitoring of Earth's rotation is performed by very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the Global Positioning System, satellite laser ranging, and other satellite geodesy techniques. This provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time, precession, and nutation.\nThe absolute value of Earth rotation including UT1 and nutation can be determined using space geodetic observations, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry and Lunar laser ranging, whereas their derivatives, denoted as Length-of-day excess and nutation rates can be derived from satellite observations, such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Satellite laser ranging to geodetic satellites.\n\nAncient observations\nThere are recorded observations of solar and lunar eclipses by Babylonian and Chinese astronomers beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from the medieval Islamic world  and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning Earth was turning faster throughout the past.\n\nCyclic variability \nAround every 25\u201330 years Earth's rotation slows temporarily by a few milliseconds per day, usually lasting around 5 years. 2017 was the fourth consecutive year that Earth's rotation has slowed. The cause of this variability has not yet been determined.\n\nOrigin \n\nEarth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust, rocks, and gas that coalesced to form the Solar System. This primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas. As this interstellar dust is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.\n\nHowever, if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the Theia impact 4.5\u00a0billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact. Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.\n\nSee also \n\n Allais effect\n Diurnal cycle\n Earth's orbit\n Earth orientation parameters\n Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n Geodesic (in mathematics)\n Geodesics in general relativity\n Geodesy\n History of Earth\n History of geodesy\n Inner core super-rotation\n List of important publications in geology\n Nychthemeron\n Spherical Earth\n World Geodetic System\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nUSNO Earth Orientation new site, being populated\nUSNO IERS old site, to be abandoned\nIERS Earth Orientation Center: Earth rotation data and interactive analysis\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\nIf the Earth's rotation period is less than 24 hours, why don't our clocks fall out of sync with the Sun?\n\nDynamics of the Solar System\nRotation\nRotation", "machine_text": " Earth's rotation is the rotation of the planet Earth around its own axis, as well as its motion around the Sun. It takes about 24 hours for the Earth to make one complete rotation, a period of time referred to as a day, and a sidereal day is the time it takes for a \"fixed\" star to pass a given point. This is different from the mean solar day, which is the interval from one mean solar noon to the next, used for example to mark the 24 hours on a regular analog clock. Earth's rotation around its own axis is termed its rotational period, and its movement around the Sun is its orbital period. Earth's rotational axis is tilted in relation to its orbit around the Sun, with an angle of 23.44 degrees (the obliquity of the ecliptic). This causes seasonal variations during the course of the year, as the hemisphere of the Earth pointing towards the Sun is receiving the most sunlight while the opposite hemisphere is in darkness. The change in the tilt of the axis during the course of each day causes the rotation period (and day length) to vary slightly throughout the year. The angle of the tilt also affects the Moon and its motion around Earth, making the time for each revolution slightly longer than a sidereal month. Earth's rotation causes the surface of the planet to experience both day and night, and the phenomenon of day and night is one of the most obvious differences between life on land and in the oceans. Earth's rotation creates physical differences between the east and west sides of the planet. That includes the water level differences and current flow disparities, the air flow differences, and the effects on flora and fauna, as well as the visibility differences. The magnetic field of the Earth is also affected by Earth's rotation. Earth's rotational velocity has a slight slowing influence on the speed of the planet's orbit (the tidal effect), thought to be caused by tidal effects from the Moon, and this has a direct effect on the Earth's climate. It also influences Earth's climate in other ways, such as changing wind and ocean currents and the positioning of the continents. The length of the day on Earth also varies over time due to changes in the length of the seasons as the movement of the Earth and Moon alter the angle of the Earth to the Sun. Earth's rotation and its orbital movements are balanced by a complex set of internal, external, and gravitational forces. The Earth's quite consistent rotation and orbital period are the result of conservation of angular momentum and energy and the effects of gravity on the Earth's mass and shape.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4396171}

The meat is then removed from the bone and served as the main course. Common accompaniments to the dish include mashed potatoes, boiled carrots, and peas. The dish is often served with a sauce made from the cooking liquids, thickened by the addition of a flour or cornstarch-based roux. In the United Kingdom, sheep's trotter recipes began to emerge in the late 19th century. The dish is featured in several classic British cookbooks, such as Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management. The dish is a commonplace in the traditional English Sunday roast dinner. The dish is also popular in a number of countries where it has its own variations. In Brazil, the dish is known as pato amarelo and is served with flavorsome ingredients such as speck, onions and tomatoes. In India, the preparation method may also vary, with some recipes including onions and other vegetables, and the addition of ginger, garlic, and a variety of spices. Sheep's trotters are a healthful dish and are rich in protein, B-vitamins, and minerals, including zinc and iron. The dish may also contain large amounts of fat, and therefore is best served in moderation. Overall, sheep's trotters are a traditional dish that have been enjoyed for centuries in a variety of countries around the world. Though it may not be as popular today in some regions as it once was, it is still served in many areas and is a tasty, nutritious dish.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51554931}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charlie Haas\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Charles Doyle Haas II (born March 27, 1972) is an American professional and former amateur wrestler. He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2000-2009 and Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2010-2013. In WWE he was a member of Team Angle, which later became a Tag Team duo with Shelton Benjamin known as \"The World's Greatest Tag Team\".\n\nHaas was an amateur wrestler in high school, and attended Seton Hall University on a wrestling scholarship, before becoming a stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and regularly teamed with his brother, Russ, with the two winning numerous championships on the independent circuit, including the CZW World Tag Team Championship and the JAPW Tag Team Championship. After signing contracts with WWE, The Haas Brothers were assigned to WWE's developmental territories, where they won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. After Russ died in 2001 due to a heart attack, Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the HWA Heavyweight Championship once.\n\nHaas formed a team with Shelton Benjamin and the two debuted on SmackDown in December 2002. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, and dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team before they split in 2004. Haas won the WWE Tag Team Championship once more with Rico, and gained Miss Jackie, whom he later married, as a valet. Haas then transferred into singles competition before being released from WWE in 2005. After a short stint in Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) and other independent promotions, Haas was re-signed to WWE in April 2006. He formed a short-lived team with Viscera, before reforming the World's Greatest Tag Team with Benjamin. After Benjamin transferred to the ECW brand, Haas began wrestling with a comical luchador persona, before developing a character where he imitated other wrestlers and WWE Hall of Famers. In addition, Haas won the last match on WWE Heat when the show ended on May 30, 2008.\n\nHaas was released from WWE in February 2010. He soon returned to the independent circuit, including returning to JAPW and appearing for Ring of Honor. In September 2010, he won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. On April 1, 2011, Haas and Benjamin won the ROH World Tag Team Championship and held it until December 2011. Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling in March 2013, but returned to competition in August that same year. Aside from wrestling, Haas and his then-wife Jackie ran a nutritional store, Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop, in Frisco, Texas, which they opened in October 2008 but has since closed.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nEarly career (1996\u20132000) \n\nAfter debuting in 1996 as a professional wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship for the second time on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating The Backseat Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere).\n\nThe Haas brothers began competing for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at The War Begins on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, and won the CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at Climbing The Ladder by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to The Backseat Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000\u20132005) \n\nAfter a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tryout match at Madison Square Garden on August 7, 2000, they signed a developmental contract with WWF. The two worked their way through the tag ranks in the WWF's developmental territories, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) and the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). The brothers won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during early 2001, defeating The Dupps the first time and The Island Boyz and Joey Matthews and Christian York in a three-way match on both the second and third occasions. Russ died from a heart attack due to a pre-existing heart condition, on December 15, 2001 at age 27. The brothers fought in house shows and dark matches in the WWF up until Russ died. After Russ' death, Charlie continue to fight in dark matches. After Russ' death as a tribute to him, Haas wrote Russ' name on his wrist tape, and used the name \"R.C. Haas\" (standing for Russ\u2013Charlie) before being called up to the main WWE roster. On January 2, 2002, Haas won the HWA Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship, by defeating Val Venis. He was later stripped of the title on January 29 due to a scripted contract loophole. After World Wrestling Entertainment (renamed from the WWF) ended its affiliation with the HWA, Haas was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he competed until December 2002.\n\nHaas debuted on WWE's main roster on the December 26, 2002 episode of SmackDown! as a heel (villainous character) along with Shelton Benjamin as Team Angle. The tag team was the \"contingency plan\" of Paul Heyman, and were intended to help WWE Champion Kurt Angle retain his title, attacking Chris Benoit and Brock Lesnar in an attempt to soften them up. They quickly won the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 6, 2003, by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero). They held the championship for three months, including a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, before losing the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri in a ladder match on May 18 at Judgment Day. On the June 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle fired Haas and Benjamin after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership. The duo then dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team, although announcers made sure to add \"Self Proclaimed\" to the name. Haas and Benjamin regained the championship from Guerrero and Tajiri on the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, but lost it to the reformed Los Guerreros on September 18. The team was separated when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 Draft Lottery.\n\nAfter Benjamin's draft, Haas turned into a fan favorite and gained Miss Jackie as a valet.  He teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22, 2004. The pair lost the championship to the Dudley Boyz on June 17, and shortly afterwards, Haas became a singles wrestler, although he retained Miss Jackie as his valet. Haas lost a match to Luther Reigns at the Great American Bash.\n\nHaas was later involved in an angle in which he was in a love triangle with Miss Jackie, who was acknowledged on-screen as his fianc\u00e9e, and Dawn Marie. The storyline culminated when Haas served as the special-guest referee in a match at Armageddon between the two women. After the match, Haas left both women in storyline, although he continued his relationship with Miss Jackie off-screen. In early 2005, he formed a tag team with Hardcore Holly. They were involved in a feud (scripted rivalry) with MNM for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but never won the championship.\n\nOn July 8, 2005, Haas was released by World Wrestling Entertainment along with his real-life wife Jackie Gayda.\n\nIndependent circuit (2005\u20132006) \nHe returned to JAPW later in July 2005, and began a feud for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship with Jay Lethal. On September 10 at JAPW Haas of Pain, Lethal defeated Haas to retain his title. In JAPW, on October 27, 2007, Haas was inducted along with his late brother Russ into the first class of the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nHe won the New Legacy Championship at Ballpark Brawl V on August 13, 2005, defeating then-champion Christopher Daniels and Chris Sabin in a triple threat match. He successfully defended the title the next night at Ballpark Brawl VI against Harry Smith with Mick Foley as a referee.\n\nDuring his time back in the independent circuit, Haas competed in the East Coast Wrestling Association's (ECWA) Super 8 Tournament in 2006, where he advanced all the way to the finals before losing to Davey Richards.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2006\u20132010)\n\nSingles competition (2006)\n\nHaas returned to WWE in 2006, appearing on the April 17, 2006, episode of Raw as Rob Van Dam's handpicked opponent for his former partner, Shelton Benjamin. Haas defeated Benjamin in the ensuing match. Haas continued to wrestle on the lower midcard spot, becoming a regular fixture on Heat.\n\nOn the June 5, 2006 episode of Raw, Haas inadvertently knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron as he was entering the ring. It was announced on WWE's official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As a result of the legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia's onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be \"just friends\". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and Heat until splitting in December 2006.\n\nThe World's Greatest Tag Team reunion (2006\u20132007) \n\nAfter Shelton Benjamin won a match against Super Crazy on the December 4, 2006, edition of Raw, Haas came out to celebrate his win with a bewildered Benjamin. Haas and Benjamin announced the return of The World's Greatest Tag Team on the December 11, 2006 edition of Raw, and they defeated The Highlanders in their return match. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme. They continued to compete on Raw through the start of 2007, facing teams including John Cena and Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair and Carlito. In mid-2007, The World's Greatest Tag Team feuded briefly with The Hardys in storyline; at the One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 3, 2007, they challenged The Hardys for the World Tag Team Championship in a ladder match but were unsuccessful. The team broke up once again when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand on November 20, 2007.\n\nVarious gimmicks and departure (2008\u20132010) \nEarly in 2008, Haas developed a gimmick in which he would go under the ring in the middle of his matches and re-emerge wearing a mask. In this \"alter-ego\", Haas would sometimes perform luchador-esque maneuvers in a comical fashion (such as attempting a diving splash, but instead landing on his feet and hitting a standing splash). The opponent would often unmask Haas mid-match, returning him to his normal demeanor. During this persona, Haas usually competed in dark matches before the live broadcast of Raw or on Heat.\n\nBeginning in late August, Haas turned into a face and began a storyline in which he began to impersonate other wrestlers, a concept created by John Laurinaitis, a WWE executive. His first match on August 25, 2008 under this gimmick was a loss to Carlito's real-life brother Primo Col\u00f3n, while Haas was parodying Carlito with the name \"Charlito\". He has portrayed such superstars as John Cena, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, Jim Ross, The Great Khali, Montel Vontavious Porter, legends such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bret Hart, \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig, Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, the Undertaker, Hulk Hogan and even WWE Diva Beth Phoenix for which he won a Slammy Award.\n\nOn April 15, 2009, Haas was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On the May 8, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Haas made his in-ring return to the brand as a heel, abandoning his persona of imitating other wrestlers, and losing to John Morrison in a match where he was accompanied by his former World's Greatest Tag Team partner, Shelton Benjamin. The following week on the May 15, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Benjamin and Haas unofficially reunited and competed against John Morrison and CM Punk in a losing effort, but Benjamin was traded to the ECW brand in June.\n\nOn July 24, 2009 episode of SmackDown, Haas competed against R-Truth in a losing effort. The following week, on July 31, 2009 episode of SmackDown, he competed against The Great Khali, ending in a no-contest due to Kane being involved in the match by attacking Ranjin Singh at Khali's corner.\n\nAfter an absence of several months, Haas made his return to television by teaming with Mike Knox in a losing effort against Cryme Tyme on the December 31, 2009 episode of Superstars. This marked Haas\u2019 last match in WWE.\n\nOn February 28, 2010, WWE announced that Haas had been released from his contract.\n\nIndependent circuit (2010) \nOn March 20, 2010, Haas made a surprise return to Jersey All Pro Wrestling and defeated Devon Moore for the JAPW New Jersey State Championship. On May 22 Haas and JAPW Heavyweight Champion Dan Maff put their titles on the line in a tag team match against the Hillbilly Wrecking Crew (Brodie Lee and Necro Butcher). In the end, Maff turned on Haas and hit him with a chair, after which Lee pinned him to win the JAPW New Jersey State Championship.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Haas won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship by defeating Michael Faith in Amarillo. In May 2011, Haas took part in New Japan Pro-Wrestling's first tour of the United States, the Invasion Tour 2011.

The following day in New York City, Haas unsuccessfully challenged Tanahashi for his title. On August 20, 2011, Haas became the inaugural Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) Heavyweight Champion by defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. He held the championship for four months before losing it to Young on December 17.\n\nRing of Honor (2010\u20132013)\n\nOn September 11, 2010, Haas and Shelton Benjamin made their debut as Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team in Ring of Honor (ROH) losing to The Kings of Wrestling at the Glory By Honor IX pay-per-view. They returned to ROH at the Ring of Honor Wrestling television tapings on December 9, where they defeated the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance).

BJ won the match when the referee stopped the match.\n\nLate career (2013-present)\nOn March 30, 2013, Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling, which coincided with him leaving Ring of Honor. He returned to the ring several months later. \n\nAt JAPW 18th Anniversary Show in November 2014, Haas, Benjamin, and Angle reunited, as Team Angle, for the first time in 11 years.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Creamy layer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Creamy layer is a term used in Indian politics to refer to some members of a backward class who are highly advanced socially as well as economically and educationally. They constitute the forward section of that particular backward class \u2013 as forward as any other forward class member. They are not eligible for government-sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the Sattanathan Commission in 1971, which directed that the \"creamy layer\" should be excluded from the reservations (quotas) of civil posts. It was also identified later by Justice Ram Nandan Committee in 1993.\n\nThe creamy layer (income) criteria were defined as gross annual income of parents from all sources more than 100,000 rupees (\u20b9 or INR defined by Sattanathan committee in 1971) In 1993 when \"creamy layer\" ceiling was introduced, it was \u20b9 1 lakh. It was subsequently revised to Rs 2.5 lakh per annum in (2004), and revised to  \u20b9 4.5 lakh (2008), Rs 6 lakh (2013) and Rs 8 lakh (2017). In October 2015, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) proposed that a person belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) with gross annual income of parents up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as the minimum ceiling for OBC. The NCBC also recommended the sub-division of OBCs into \"backward\", \"more backward\", and \"extremely backward\" blocs and divide 27% quota amongst them in proportion to their population, to ensure that stronger OBCs don't corner the quota benefits.\n\nClassification\nThe Supreme Court of India defined the \"creamy layer\", quoting an Indian governmental office memorandum dated 8 September 1993. The term was originally introduced in the context of reservation of jobs for certain groups in Indra Sawhney & Others v. Union of India case in 1992. The Supreme Court has said that the benefit of reservation should not be given to OBC children of constitutional functionaries\u2014such as the President, Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, employees of central and state bureaucracies above a certain level, public sector employees, and members of the armed forces and paramilitary personnel above the rank of colonel.  Those from scheduled castes (SCs) and in scheduled tribes (STs) are exempt from this classification, and always receive the benefits of reservation regardless of family income. Those not from preferred groups do not now receive the benefit of reservation regardless of how low the family income.\n\nThe children of persons engaged in trade, industry and professions such as a doctor, lawyer, chartered accountant, income tax consultant, financial or management consultant, dental surgeon, engineer, computer specialist, film artists and other film professional, author, playwright, sports person, sports professional, media professional or any other vocations of like status whose annual income is more than \u20b9 800,000 (Rs 8 lakh) for a period of three consecutive years are also excluded. [OBC children belong to any family earning a total gross annual income (from sources other than salary and agricultural land) of less than Rs 6 lakh for a period of three consecutive year\u2014as the 1993 income ceiling for the creamy layer was raised from \u20b9 100,000 (Rs 1 lakh, when the office memo was accepted) to Rs 6 lakh for a period of three consecutive years (in May 2013). Individuals belonging to the creamy layer are also excluded from being categorised as \"socially and educationally backward\" regardless of their social/educational backwardness.\n\nApplication on SC/ST quota\nThe 'creamy layer' categorization was meant only for the OBCs until 30 September 2018 but now are also applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it was argued that it is not on economic basis rather on the basis of untouchability or backwardness. This applied only in reservations in promotion and rest remain the same. In December 2019, the central govt has appealed in Surpeme court against the previous order of applicability of creamy layer to the SC/ST quota.\n\nSee also\n Caste system in India\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Writereaddata/dopteng.pdf\n Jee IITM Information.\n National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) government website.\n\nReservation in India\nCaste system in India\nOther Backward Classes", "machine_text": " The Creamy Layer (also referred to as the Creamy Class) is a phrase used in the Indian context to classify the higher echelons of socio-economic stratification. The term has its origin in the Creamy Layer principle of affirmative action, a tool adopted by the Indian Government to promote socio-economic equality within the public sector. The concept of the Creamy Layer first emerged in the early 1970s when the Indian government began implementing a series of reservations and support mechanisms aimed at improving the socio-economic plight of its marginalised castes and ethnic communities. These programmes were designed to help marginalised communities in the job market, in education, and other areas of public life. In order to build a system of equality, it became necessary to exclude the cream of these communities from the system of reservations, so as to ensure that only the most disadvantaged were served by the programmes. The Indian government identified the Creamy Layer as those members of marginalised communities who had achieved a certain level of educational and economic development, beyond what could reasonably be expected from their communities. This has been the basis for the government\u2019s policy of excluding the Creamy Layer from quotas and benefits extended to the marginalised communities. The revised version of the National Anti-Exploitation Act of 2000 defines the term \u2018Creamy Layer\u2019 as \u201cpersons in or from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other backward Classes of citizens who satisfy either of the two conditions as certified by a competent authority: (a) having an annual family income of four lakh rupees; or (b) being a holder of a constitutional office or post or of any other type of post under the State.\u201d The Creamy Layer Principle is an important element of India\u2019s affirmative action policies, and has the potential to boost social mobility within the country. However, not all people are in favour of this policy, as some argue that it is an artificial and arbitrary classification of the population, and does not serve to address existing deep-seated socio-economic inequalities and injustices. The issue of the Creamy Layer and other similar measures has been discussed in the Supreme Court of India several times, most notably in the landmark Indra Sawhney Case in 1992. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the exclusion of the Creamy Layer from the scope of benefits and reservations is permissible, provided that the classification is reasonable and correlates to the objective it seeks to achieve. In recent times, the Indian government has taken steps to modify the Creamy Layer limits for different castes and communities. In 2019, the government raised the creamy layer limit to Rs 8 lakhs for Other Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, as well as barring income tax payees and those in high-paying public and private sector jobs, apart from a few other criteria, from applying for the quotas and benefits extended by the state. The debate over the Creamy Layer Principle is a major one in India, with both supporters and opponents viewing it from different perspectives and arguing for or against its implementation. Regardless, it is undeniable that this concept has been instrumental in the implementation of equality-driven policies in the country, and is likely to remain one of the most vital tools for affirmative action in the coming years.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8345406}

Jeannie wrote \"It's Love That's Ruining Me\" as an ode to unrequited love and longing for someone who has moved on from them. She wanted to convey a near universal and timeless emotion that many young people experience, regardless of time and place. According to Jeannie, \"there aren't many things as powerful and all consuming as love. When the person you love and adore has moved on with their life and you're left behind, the loneliness you feel can be almost paralyzing.\" Upon release, the song was met with positive reception. Critics praised Jeannie's compelling lyrics and delivery. The song was noted for its catchy chorus and production, as well as its emotion-filled melody. It was described as a \"raw, powerful and heartbreaking indie-pop anthem.\" The accompanying music video, released on the same day, was directed by Steph Hesp. The video stars Jeannie, who plays an Edwardian woman in the 1900s, and focuses on the sadness and heartache that followed the end of a relationship. To promote the single, Jeannie appeared on a number of radio programs and gave multiple interviews describing the song and its meaning. She also performed the single on television shows like The Graham Norton Show. The single was later included in the 2020 fan compilation, Like a Flame: The Collection, as a bonus track. The song was also featured on a number of streaming playlists. \"It's Love That's Ruining Me\" was a commercial success, charting in the UK at number ten and Belgium at number twelve.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh (; ; born as Nguyen Xuan Bao; October 11, 1926 \u2013 January 22, 2022) was a Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n Buddhist monk, peace activist, prolific author, poet, teacher, and founder of the Plum Village Tradition, historically recognized as the main inspiration for engaged Buddhism. Known as the \"father of mindfulness\", Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was a major influence on Western practices of Buddhism.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh co-founded the School of Youth for Social Services and created the Order of Interbeing. He was exiled from Vietnam in 1966 after expressing opposition to the war. In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh established dozens of monasteries and practice centers and spent many years living at the Plum Village Monastery, which he founded in 1982 in southwest France near Th\u00e9nac, travelling internationally to give retreats and talks. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh promoted deep listening as a nonviolent solution to conflict and sought to raise awareness of the interconnectedness of all elements in nature. He coined the term \"engaged Buddhism\" in his book Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire. \n\nAfter a 39-year exile, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was permitted to visit Vietnam in 2005. In November 2018, he returned to Vietnam to his \"root temple\", T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple, near Hu\u1ebf, where he lived until his death on January 22, 2022, at the age of 95.\n\nEarly life\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was born as Nguyen Xuan Bao on October 11, 1926, in the ancient capital of Hu\u1ebf in central Vietnam. He is 15th generation Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh; the poet Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u, author of L\u1ee5c V\u00e2n Ti\u00ean, was his ancestor. His father, Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Ph\u00fac, from Th\u00e0nh Trung village in Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean, Hu\u1ebf, was an official with the French administration. His mother, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb D\u0129, was a homemaker from Gio Linh district. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was the fifth of their six children. Until he was age five, he lived with his large extended family at his grandmother's home. He recalled feeling joy at age seven or eight after he saw a drawing of a peaceful Buddha, sitting on the grass. At age 12, he expressed an interest in training to become a monk, which his parents, cautious at first, eventually let him pursue at age 16.\n\nNames applied to him \nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh had many names in his lifetime. As a boy, he received a formal family name (Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Lang) to register for school, but was known by his nickname (B\u00e9 Em). He received a spiritual name (\u0110i\u1ec7u Sung) as an aspirant for the monkhood; a Lineage name (Tr\u1eebng Quang) when he formally became a lay Buddhist; and when he ordained as a monk he received a Dharma name (Ph\u00f9ng Xu\u00e2n). He took the Dharma title Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh when he moved to Saigon in 1949.\n\nThe Vietnamese name Th\u00edch (\u91cb) is from \"Th\u00edch Ca\" or \"Th\u00edch Gi\u00e0\" (\u91cb\u8fe6, \"of the Shakya clan\"). All Buddhist monastics in East Asian Buddhism adopt this name as their surname, implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many Buddhist traditions, a person can receive a progression of names. The lineage name is given first when a person takes refuge in the Three Jewels. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's lineage name is Tr\u1eebng Quang (\u6f84\u5149, \"Clear, Reflective Light\"). The second is a dharma name, given when a person takes vows or is ordained as a monastic. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's dharma name is Ph\u00f9ng Xu\u00e2n (\u9022\u6625, \"Meeting Spring\") and his dharma title is Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh.\n\nNeither Nh\u1ea5t (\u4e00) nor H\u1ea1nh (\u884c), which approximate the roles of middle name and given name, was part of his name at birth. Nh\u1ea5t means \"one\", implying \"first-class\", or \"of best quality\"; H\u1ea1nh means \"action\", implying \"right conduct\" or \"good nature\". He translated his Dharma names as \"One\" (Nh\u1ea5t) and \"Action\" (H\u1ea1nh). Vietnamese names follow this convention, placing the family name first, then the middle name, which often refers to the person's position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's followers called him  (\"master; teacher\"), or Th\u1ea7y Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh. Any Vietnamese monk in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as \"th\u1ea7y\", with monks addressed as th\u1ea7y tu (\"monk\") and nuns addressed as s\u01b0 c\u00f4 (\"sister\") or s\u01b0 b\u00e0 (\"elder sister\").  He is also known as Thi\u1ec1n S\u01b0 Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh (\"Zen Master Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh\").\n\nEducation\nAt age 16, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh entered the monastery at T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple, where his primary teacher was Zen Master Thanh Qu\u00fd Ch\u00e2n Th\u1eadt, who was from the 43rd generation of the L\u00e2m T\u1ebf Zen school and the ninth generation of the Li\u1ec5u Qu\u00e1n school. He studied as a novice for three years and received training in Vietnamese traditions of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh attended B\u00e1o Qu\u1ed1c Buddhist Academy, where he was ordained as a monk in 1949. Dissatisfied with the focus at B\u00e1o Qu\u1ed1c Academy, which he found lacking in philosophy, literature, and foreign languages, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh left in 1950 and took up residence in the \u1ea4n Quang Pagoda in Saigon. He supported himself by selling books and poetry while attending Saigon University, where he studied science. \n\nIn 1955, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to Hu\u1ebf and served as the editor of Ph\u1eadt Gi\u00e1o Vi\u1ec7t Nam (Vietnamese Buddhism), the official publication of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhists (T\u1ed5ng H\u1ed9i Ph\u1eadt Gi\u00e1o Vi\u1ec7t Nam) for two years before the publication was suspended as higher-ranking monks disapproved of his writing. He believed that this was due to his opinion that South Vietnam's various Buddhist organisations should unite. In 1956, while he was away teaching in \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t, his name was expunged from the records of \u1ea4n Quang, effectively disowning him from the temple. In late 1957, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh decided to go on retreat, and established a monastic \u201ccommunity of resistance\u201d named Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u00f4i, in \u0110\u1ea1i Lao Forest near \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t. During this period, he taught at a nearby high school and continued to write, promoting the idea of a humanistic, unified Buddhism. \n\nFrom 1959 to 1961, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh taught several short courses on Buddhism at various Saigon temples, including the large X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda, where his class was cancelled mid-session and he was removed due to disapproval of his teachings. Facing further opposition from Vietnamese religious and secular authorities, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh accepted a Fulbright Fellowship in 1960 to study comparative religion at Princeton University. He studied at the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1961. In 1962 he was appointed lecturer in Buddhism at Columbia University and also taught as a lecturer at Cornell University. By then he had gained fluency in French, Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali and English, in addition to his native Vietnamese.\n\nCareer\n\nActivism in Vietnam 1963\u20131966 \nIn 1963, after the military overthrow of the minority Catholic regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to Vietnam on 16 December 1963, at the request of Thich Tri Quang, the monk most prominent in protesting the religious discrimination of Diem, to help restructure the administration of Vietnamese Buddhism. As a result of a congress, the General Association of Buddhists and other groups merged to form the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) in January 1964, and Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh proposed that the executive publicly call for an end to the Vietnam War, help establish an institute for the study of Buddhism to train future leaders, and create a centre to train pacifist social workers based on Buddhist teaching.\n\nIn 1964, two of Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's students founded La Boi Press with a grant from Mrs. Ngo Van Hieu. Within two years, the press published 12 books, but by 1966, the publishers risked arrest and jail because the word \"peace\" was taken to mean communism. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh also edited the weekly journal H\u1ea3i Tri\u1ec1u \u00c2m (Sound of the Rising Tide), the UBCV's official publication. He continually advocated peace and reconciliation, notably calling in September 1964, soon after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, for a peace settlement, and referring to the Viet Cong as brothers. The South Vietnamese government subsequently closed the journal.\n\nOn May 1, 1966, at T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh received the \"lamp transmission\" from Zen Master Ch\u00e2n Th\u1eadt, making him a dharmacharya (teacher) and the spiritual head of T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu and associated monasteries.\n\nV\u1ea1n Hanh Buddhist University \nOn 13 March 1964, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and the monks at An Quang Pagoda founded the Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies (H\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7n Ph\u1eadt Gi\u00e1o Vi\u1ec7t Nam), with the UBCV's support and endorsement. Renamed V\u1ea1n Hanh Buddhist University, it was a private institution that taught Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages, in Saigon. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh taught Buddhist psychology and prajnaparamita literature there, and helped finance the university by fundraising from supporters.\n\nSchool of Youth for Social Service (SYSS) \nIn 1964, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh co-founded the School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS), a neutral corps of Buddhist peace workers who went into rural areas to establish schools, build healthcare clinics, and help rebuild villages. The SYSS consisted of 10,000 volunteers and social workers who aided war-torn villages, rebuilt schools and established medical centers. He left for the U.S. shortly afterwards and was not allowed to return, leaving Sister Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng in charge of the SYSS. Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng was central to the foundation and many of the activities of the SYSS, which organized medical, educational and agricultural facilities in rural Vietnam during the war. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was initially given substantial autonomy to run the SYSS, which was initially part of V\u1ea1n H\u1ea1nh University. In April 1966, the V\u1ea1n H\u1ea1nh Students\u2019 Union under the presidency of Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng issued a \"Call for Peace\". Vice Chancellor Th\u00edch Minh Ch\u00e2u dissolved the students' union and removed the SYSS from the university's auspices.\n\nThe Order of Interbeing \n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh created the Order of Interbeing (), a monastic and lay group, between 1964 and 1966. He headed this group, teaching the Five Mindfulness Trainings and the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh established the Order of Interbeing from a selection of six SYSS board members, three men and three women, who took a vow to practice the Fourteen Precepts of Engaged Budhism. He added a seventh member in 1981. \n\nIn 1967, Nhat Chi Mai, one of the first six Order of Interbeing members, lit herself on fire in front of the Tu Nghiem Pagoda in Saigon as a peace protest after calling for an end to the Vietnam War. On several occasions, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh explained to Westerners that Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c and other Vietnamese Buddhist monks who self-immolated during the Vietnam war did not perform acts of suicide; rather, their acts were, in his words, aimed \"at moving the hearts of the oppressors, and at calling the attention of the world to the suffering endured then by the Vietnamese.\"\n\nThe Order of Interbeing expanded into an international community of laypeople and monastics focused on \"mindfulness practice, ethical behavior, and compassionate action in society.\" By 2017, the group had grown to include thousands known to recite the Fourteen Precepts.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War\n\nV\u1ea1n H\u1ea1nh University was taken over by one of the chancellors, who wished to sever ties with Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and the SYSS, accusing Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng of being a communist. Thereafter the SYSS struggled to raise funds and faced attacks on its members. It persisted in its relief efforts without taking sides in the conflict.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to the U.S. in 1966 to lead a symposium in Vietnamese Buddhism at Cornell University and continue his work for peace. He was invited by Professor George McTurnan Kahin, also of Cornell and a U.S. government foreign policy consultant, to participate on a forum on U.S. policy in Vietnam. On June 1, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh released a five-point proposal addressed to the U.S. government, recommending that (1) the U.S. make a clear statement of its desire to help the Vietnamese people form a government \"truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations\"; (2) the U.S. and South Vietnam cease air strikes throughout Vietnam; (3) all anti-communist military operations be purely defensive; (4) the U.S. demonstrate a willingness to withdraw within a few months; and (5) the U.S. offer to pay for reconstruction. In 1967 he wrote Vietnam \u2014 The Lotus in the Sea of Fire, about his proposals. The South Vietnamese military junta responded by accusing him of treason and being a communist.\n\nWhile in the U.S., Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh visited Gethsemani Abbey to speak with the Trappist monk Thomas Merton. When the South Vietnamese regime threatened to block Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's reentry to the country, Merton wrote an essay of solidarity, \"Nhat Hanh is my Brother\". In 1964, after the publication of his famous poem, \"whoever is listening, be my witness: I cannot accept this war...\", Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was labeled an \"antiwar poet\" and denounced as a \"pro-Communist propagandist\" by the American press. In 1965 he had written Martin Luther King Jr. a letter titled \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". During his 1966 stay in the U.S., Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh met King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, King gave the speech \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\" at Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, King nominated Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \"I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\". King also called Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh \"an apostle of peace and non-violence\". King had revealed the candidate he had chosen to nominate with a \"strong request\" to the prize committee was in sharp violation of Nobel traditions and protocol. The committee did not make an award that year.\n\nRefuge in France \nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh moved to Paris, France, in 1966. He became the chair of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation. \n\nIn 1969, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh established the Unified Buddhist Church (\u00c9glise Bouddhique Unifi\u00e9e) in France (not a part of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam). In 1975, he formed the Sweet Potatoes Meditation Centre at Fontvannes, in the Foret d\u2019Othe, near Troyes in Aube province southeast of Paris. For the next seven years, he focused on writing, and completed The Miracle of Mindfulness, The Moon Bamboo, and The Sun My Heart. \n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh began teaching mindfulness in the mid-1970s with his books, particularly The Miracle of Mindfulness (1975), serving as the main vehicle for his early teachings. In an interview for On Being, he said that The Miracle of Mindfulness was \"written for our social workers, first, in Vietnam, because they were living in a situation where the danger of dying was there every day. So out of compassion, out of a willingness to help them to continue their work, The Miracle of Mindfulness was written as a manual practice. And after that, many friends in the West, they think that it is helpful for them, so we allow it to be translated into English.\"\n\nCampaign to help boat people and expulsion from Singapore \nWhen the North Vietnamese army took control of the south in 1975, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was denied permission to return to Vietnam, and the communist government banned his publications. He soon began to lead efforts to help rescue Vietnamese boat people in the Gulf of Siam, eventually stopping under pressure from the governments of Thailand and Singapore.\n\nRecounting his experience years later, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh said he was in Singapore attending a conference on religion and peace when he discovered the plight of the suffering of the boat people:So many boat people were dying in the ocean, and Singapore had a very harsh policy on the boat people\u2026 The policy of Singapore at that time was to reject the boat people; Malaysia, also. They preferred to have the boat people die in the ocean rather than to bring them to land and make them into prisoners. Every time there was a boat with the boat people [that came] to the shore, they tried to push them [back] out into the sea in order [for them] to die. They didn't want to host [them]. And those fishermen who had compassion, who were able to save the boat people from drowning in the sea, were punished. They had to pay a very huge sum of money so that next time they won't have the courage to save the boat people.He stayed on in Singapore to organise a secret rescue operation. Aided by concerned individuals from France, the Netherlands, and other European countries, he hired a boat to bring food, water and medicine to refugees in the sea. Sympathetic fishermen who had rescued boat people would call up his team, and they shuttled the refugees to the French embassy in the middle of the night and helped them climb into the compound, before they were discovered by staff in the morning and handed over to the police where they were placed in the relative safety of detention. \n\nWhen the Singapore government discovered the clandestine network, the police surrounded its office and impounded the passports of both Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng, giving them 24 hours to leave the country. It was only with the intervention of the then-French ambassador to Singapore Jacques Gasseau that they were given 10 days to wind down their rescue operations.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was only allowed to return to Singapore in 2010 to lead a meditation retreat at the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.\n\nPlum Village \nIn 1982, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng established the Plum Village Monastery, a vihara in the Dordogne near Bordeaux in southern France. Plum Village is the largest Buddhist monastery in Europe and America, with over 200 monastics and over 10,000 visitors a year.\n\nThe Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism (formerly the Unified Buddhist Church) and its sister organization in France, the Congr\u00e9gation Bouddhique Zen Village des Pruniers, are the legally recognized governing bodies of Plum Village in France.\n\nExpanded practice centers \nBy 2019, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh had built a network of monasteries and retreat centers in half a dozen countries, including France, the U.S., Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Additional practice centers and associated organizations Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and the Order of Interbeing established include Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York; the Community of Mindful Living in Berkeley, California; Parallax Press; Deer Park Monastery (Tu Vi\u1ec7n L\u1ed9c Uy\u1ec3n), established in 2000 in Escondido, California; Magnolia Grove Monastery (\u0110\u1ea1o Tr\u00e0ng M\u1ed9c Lan) in Batesville, Mississippi; and the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbr\u00f6l, Germany. (The Maple Forest Monastery (Tu Vi\u1ec7n R\u1eebng Phong) and Green Mountain Dharma Center (\u00d0\u1ea1o Tr\u00e0ng Thanh S\u01a1n) in Vermont closed in 2007 and moved to the Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush.) The monasteries, open to the public during much of the year, provide ongoing retreats for laypeople, while the Order of Interbeing holds retreats for specific groups of laypeople, such as families, teenagers, military veterans, the entertainment industry, members of Congress, law enforcement officers and people of colour. \n\nAccording to the Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh Foundation, the charitable organization that serves as the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism's fundraising arm, as of 2017 the monastic order Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh established comprises over 750 monastics in 9 monasteries worldwide.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh established two monasteries in Vietnam, at the original T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple near Hu\u1ebf and at Prajna Temple in the central highlands.\n\nWritings\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh has published over 130 books, including more than 100 in English, which as of January 2019 had sold over five million copies worldwide. His books, which cover topics including spiritual guides and Buddhist texts, teachings on mindfulness, poetry, story collections, and scholarly essays on Zen practice, have been translated into more than 40 languages as of January 2022. In 1986 Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh founded Parallax Press, a nonprofit book publisher and part of the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism.\n\nDuring his long exile, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's books were often smuggled into Vietnam, where they had been banned.\n\nLater activism \nIn 2014, major Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed called for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by 2020. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was represented by Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was known to refrain from consuming animal products as a means of nonviolence toward animals.\n\nRelations with Vietnamese governments\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's relationship with the government of Vietnam varied over the years. He stayed away from politics, but did not support the South Vietnamese government's policies of Catholicization. He questioned American involvement, putting him at odds with the Saigon leadership, which banned him from returning to South Vietnam while he was abroad in 1966.\n\nHis relationship with the communist government ruling Vietnam was tense due to its atheism, though he had little interest in politics. The communist government viewed him with skepticism, distrusted his work with the overseas Vietnamese population, and restricted his praying requiem on several occasions.\n\nReturn visits to Vietnam 2005\u20132007 \n\nIn 2005, after lengthy negotiations, the Vietnamese government allowed Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh to return for a visit. He was also allowed to teach there, publish four of his books in Vietnamese, and travel the country with monastic and lay members of his Order, including a return to his root temple, Tu Hieu Temple in Hu\u1ebf. The trip was not without controversy. Thich Vien Dinh, writing on behalf of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), called for Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh to make a statement against the Vietnamese government's poor record on religious freedom. Vien Dinh feared that the government would use the trip as propaganda, suggesting that religious freedom is improving there, while abuses continue.\n\nDespite the controversy, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh returned to Vietnam in 2007, while the heads of the UBCV, Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do, remained under house arrest. The UBCV called his visit a betrayal, symbolizing his willingness to work with his co-religionists' oppressors. V\u00f5 V\u0103n \u00c1i, a UBCV spokesman, said, \"I believe Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's trip is manipulated by the Hanoi government to hide its repression of the Unified Buddhist Church and create a false impression of religious freedom in Vietnam.\" The Plum Village website listed three goals for his 2007 trip to Vietnam: to support new monastics in his Order; to organize and conduct \"Great Chanting Ceremonies\" intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam War; and to lead retreats for monastics and laypeople. The chanting ceremonies were originally called \"Grand Requiem for Praying Equally for All to Untie the Knots of Unjust Suffering\", but Vietnamese officials objected, calling it unacceptable for the government to \"equally\" pray for South Vietnamese and U.S. soldiers. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh agreed to change the name to \"Grand Requiem For Praying\". During the 2007 visit, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh suggested ending government control of religion to President Nguyen Minh Triet. A provincial police officer later spoke to a reporter about this incident, accusing Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh of breaking Vietnamese law. The officer said, \"[Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh] should focus on Buddhism and keep out of politics.\"\n\nDuring the 2005 visit, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh 's followers were invited by Abbot Duc Nghi, a member of the official Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, to occupy Bat Nha monastery and continue their practice there. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's followers say that during a sacred ceremony at Plum Village Monastery in 2006, Nghi received a transmission from Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh and agreed to let them occupy Bat Nha. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's followers spent $1 million developing the monastery, building a meditation hall for 1,800 people. The government support initially given to his supporters is now believed to have been a ploy to get Vietnam off the US State Department's Religious Freedom blacklist, improve chances of entry into the World Trade Organization, and increase foreign investment.\n\nIn 2008, during an interview in Italian television, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh made some statements regarding the Dalai Lama that his followers claim upset Chinese officials, who in turn put pressure on the Vietnamese government. The chairman of Vietnam's national Committee on Religious Affairs sent a letter that accused Nhat Hanh's organization of publishing false information about Vietnam on its website. It was written that the posted information misrepresented Vietnam's policies on religion and could undermine national unity. The chairman requested that Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's followers leave Bat Nha. The letter also stated that Abbot Duc Nghi wanted them to leave. \"Duc Nghi is breaking a vow that he made to us... We have videotapes of him inviting us to turn the monastery into a place for worship in the Plum Village tradition, even after he dies \u2014 life after life. Nobody can go against that wish,\" said Brother Phap Kham. In September and October 2009, a standoff developed, which ended when authorities cut the power, and followed up with police raids augmented by mobs assembled through gang contacts. The attackers used sticks and hammers to break in and dragged off hundreds of monks and nuns. \"Senior monks were dragged like animals out of their rooms, then left sitting in the rain until police dragged them to the taxis where \u2018black society\u2019 bad guys pushed them into cars,\" a villager said in a phone interview. Two senior monks had their IDs taken and were put under house arrest without charges in their home towns.\n\nReligious approach and influence \n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh combined a variety of teachings of Early Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhist traditions of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and Zen, and ideas from Western psychology to teach mindfulness of breathing and the four foundations of mindfulness, offering a modern perspective on meditation practice. His presentation of the Prajnaparamita in terms of \"interbeing\" has doctrinal antecedents in the Huayan school of thought, which \"is often said to provide a philosophical foundation\" for Zen.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh completed new English and Vietnamese translations of the Heart Sutra in September 2014. In a letter to his students, he said he wrote these new translations because he thought that poor word choices in the original text had resulted in significant misunderstandings of these teachings for almost 2,000 years.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh has also been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism movement (he is credited with coining the term), promoting the individual's active role in creating change. He rephrased the five precepts for lay Buddhists, which were traditionally written in terms of refraining from negative activities, as committing to taking positive action to prevent or minimize others' negative actions. For example, instead of merely refraining from stealing, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh wrote, \"prevent others from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on Earth\" by, for example, taking action against unfair practices or unsafe workplaces.King, pp. 26\u201327. He credited the 13th-century Vietnamese Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng with originating the concept. Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition.\n\nCalled \"the Father of Mindfulness,\" Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh has been credited as one of the main figures in bringing Buddhism to the West, and especially for making mindfulness well known in the West. According to James Shaheen, the editor of the American Buddhist magazine Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, \"In the West, he's an icon. I can't think of a Western Buddhist who does not know of Thich Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh.\" His 1975 book The Miracle of Mindfulness was credited with helping to \"lay the foundations\" for the use of mindfulness in treating depression through \"mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\", influencing the work of University of Washington psychology professor Marsha M. Linehan, the originator of Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). J. Mark G. Williams of Oxford University and the Oxford Mindfulness Centre has said, \"What he was able to do was to communicate the essentials of Buddhist wisdom and make it accessible to people all over the world, and build that bridge between the modern world of psychological science and the modern healthcare system and these ancient wisdom practices \u2013 and then he continued to do that in his teaching.\" One of Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's students, Jon Kabat-Zinn, developed the mindfulness-based stress reduction course that is available at hospitals and medical centres across the world, and as of 2015, around 80% of medical schools are reported to have offered mindfulness training. As of 2019, it was reported that mindfulness as espoused by Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh had become the theoretical underpinning of a $1.1 billion industry in the U.S. One survey determined that 35% of employers used mindfulness in practices in the workplace.\n\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was also known for his involvement in interfaith dialogue, which was not common when he began. He was noted for his friendships with Martin Luther King Jr and Thomas Merton, and King wrote in his Nobel nomination for Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, \"His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a momentum to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\". Merton wrote an essay for Jubilee in August 1966 titled \"Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh Is My Brother\", in which he said, \"I have far more in common with Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh than I have with many Americans, and I do not hesitate to say it. It is vitally important that such bonds be admitted. They are the bonds of a new solidarity ... which is beginning to be evident on all five continents and which cuts across all political, religious and cultural lines to unite young men and women in every country in something that is more concrete than an ideal and more alive than a program.\" The same year, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh met with Pope Paul VI and the pair called on Catholics and Buddhists to help bring about world peace, especially relating to the conflict in Vietnam. According to Buddhism scholar Sallie B. King, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was \"extremely skilled at expressing their teachings in the language of a kind of universal spirituality rather than a specifically Buddhist terminology. The language of this universal spirituality is the same as the basic values that they see expressed in other religions as well\".\n\nHealth\n\nIn November 2014, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh experienced a severe brain hemorrhage and was hospitalized. After months of rehabilitation, he was released from the stroke rehabilitation clinic at Bordeaux Segalen University. On July 11, 2015, he flew to San Francisco to speed his recovery with an aggressive rehabilitation program at UCSF Medical Center. He returned to France on January 8, 2016.\n\nAfter spending 2016 in France, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh travelled to Thai Plum Village. He continued to see both Eastern and Western specialists while in Thailand, but was unable to verbally communicate for the remainder of his life.\n\nFinal years in Vietnam 2018\u20132022 \nOn November 2, 2018, a press release from the Plum Village community confirmed that Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, then 92, had returned to Vietnam a final time and would live at T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple for \"his remaining days\". In a meeting with senior disciples, he had \"clearly communicated his wish to return to Vietnam using gestures, nodding and shaking his head in response to questions\". \n\nIn January 2019, a representative of Plum Village, Sister True Dedication, wrote:\n\nWhile it was clear Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh could no longer speak, Vietnamese authorities assigned plainclothes police to monitor his activities at the temple.\n\nDeath\nNh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh died at his residence in T\u1eeb Hi\u1ebfu Temple on January 22, 2022, at age 95, as a result of complications from his stroke seven years earlier. His death was widely mourned by various Buddhist groups in and outside Vietnam. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the U.S. State Department also issued words of condolence.\n\nHis five-day funeral, which began on the day of his death, had a seven-day wake that culminated with his cremation on January 29. In a 2015 book, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh described what he wanted for the disposition of his remains, in part to illustrate how he believes that he \"continues\" on in his teachings:\n\nBibliography\n\n A Pebble for Your Pocket, Full Circle Publishing, 2001, \n Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames, Riverhead Trade, 2002, \n At Home in the World: Stories and Essential Teachings from a Monk's Life, with Jason Deantonis (Illustrator), Parallax Press, 2016, \n The Moon Bamboo, Parallax Press, 1989, \n Be Free Where You Are, Parallax Press, 2002, \n Being Peace, Parallax Press, 1987, \n Buddha Mind, Buddha Body: Walking Toward Enlightenment, Parallax Press, 2007, \n Cultivating The Mind Of Love, Full Circle, 1996, \n Fear: Essential Wisdom for Getting Through the Storm, HarperOne, 2012, \n Fragrant Palm Leaves: Journals, 1962\u20131966, Riverhead Trade, 1999, \n Going Home: Jesus and Buddha as Brothers, Riverhead Books, 1999, \n Hermitage Among the Clouds, Parallax Press, 1993, \n How to Eat, Parallax Press, 2014, \n How to Fight, Parallax Press, 2017, \n How to Love, Parallax Press, 2014, \n How to Relax, Parallax Press, 2015, \n How to Sit, Parallax Press, 2014, \n Is nothing something? : Kids' questions and zen answers about life, death, family, friendship, and everything in between, Parallax Press 2014, \n Living Buddha, Living Christ, Riverhead Trade, 1997, \n Love Letter to the Earth, Parallax Press, 2012, \n Mindful Movements: Ten Exercises for Well-Being, Parallax Press 2008, \n No Death, No Fear, Riverhead Trade reissue, 2003, \n No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming Suffering, Parallax Press, 2014, \n Old Path White Clouds: Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha, Parallax Press, 1991, \n Old Path, White Clouds: Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha Blackstone Audio, Inc.; 2016, \n Our Appointment with Life: Sutra on Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone, Parallax Press, 1990, \n Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life, Bantam reissue, 1992, \n Reconciliation: Healing the Inner Child, Parallax Press, 2010, \n \n Silence: The Power of Quiet in a World Full of Noise, HarperOne (1705), 2015, ASIN: B014TAC7GQ\n Teachings on Love, Full Circle Publishing, 2005, \n The Art of Communicating, HarperOne, 2013, \n The Art of Living: Peace and Freedom in the Here and Now, HarperOne, 2017, \n The Art of Power, HarperOne, 2007, \n The Blooming of a Lotus, Beacon Press, 2009, \n The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion, Commentaries on the Prajnaparamita Diamond Sutrs, Parallax Press, 1992, \n The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching, Broadway Books, 1999, \n The Heart Of Understanding: Commentaries on the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra, Full Circle, 1997, ,  (2005 Edition)\n The Miracle of Mindfulness, Rider Books, 1991, \n The Miracle of Mindfulness: A Manual on Meditation, Beacon Press, 1999,  (Vietnamese: Ph\u00e9p l\u1ea1 c\u1ee7a s\u1ef1 t\u1ec9nh th\u1ee9c).\n The Novice: A Story of True Love, HarperCollins, 2011, \n The Other Shore: A New Translation of the Heart Sutra with Commentaries, Palm Leaves Press, 2017, \n The Path of Emancipation: Talks from a 21-Day Mindfulness Retreat, Unified Buddhist Church, 2000, \n The Pocket Thich Nhat Hanh, Shambhala Pocket Classics, 2012, \n The Raft Is Not the Shore: Conversations Toward a Buddhist/Christian Awareness, Daniel Berrigan (Co-author), Orbis Books, 2000, \n The Sun My Heart, Parallax Press, 1988, \n Thich Nhat Hanh: Essential Writings, Robert Ellsberg (Editor), Orbis Books, 2001, \n Touching the Earth: Intimate Conversations with the Buddha, Parallax Press, 2004, \n Transformation and Healing: Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Full Circle, 1997, \n True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart, Shambhala Publications, 1997, \n Under the Banyan Tree, Full Circle Publishing, 2008, \n Understanding Our Mind, HarperCollins, 2006, \n Vietnam: Lotus in a sea of fire.

He has authored more than 100 books, of which many have been translated in English and other languages. He is also active in the peace movement, promoting nonviolent solutions to conflicts between nations as well as between individuals. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was born in the central province of Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean in Vietnam. He was ordained as a novice monk at the age of 16. He studied Buddhism at the prestigious and conservative ... Tam B\u1ea3o Monastery before he participated in the nonviolent struggle for Vietnamese independence from France, between 1945 and 1954. In the 1960s and 1970s, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh promoted reconciliation between North and South Vietnam and in 1982 he founded the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Under the communist government of Vietnam, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh was denied a passport until 2005. In 1963, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh preached his first Dharma talks in America, receiving the homage of thousands of people. Since then, he has been a frequent visitor to the US and Europe, where he has guided retreats, founded monasteries, and given numerous Dharma talks. In 1982, he founded the Order of Interbeing (Ti\u1ec1n \u00c2n T\u1ef1) in Vietnam and Plum Village in France, the largest Buddhist monastery in Europe. In 2006 he established Blue Cliff Monastery in New York specifically for lay people. His best known works include: The Miracle of Mindfulness (1975), Being Peace (1987), and For a Future to Be Possible (1993). He has also written several books on engaged Buddhism and \u201cmindful consumption\u201d such as The World We Have (2008). He lives in Plum Village in southwest France and serves as the spiritual advisor of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. In 2016, he was awarded the Niwano Peace Prize. Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh is now 93-years-old and continues to lead mindfulness retreats around the world. In 2009, Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh also served as an Honorary Patron for the Community of Interbeing, which is a branch of Plum Village supported by lay practitioners. He has also contributed significantly to the Thich Nhat Hanh Foundation, a U.S.-based educational charity, and Peace & Happiness Movement, a non-profit with the mission of inspiring and educating people on the path of mindful living.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30769}

Born in Seattle, Washington, she was the daughter and eldest child of Chicago native, Arthur Charles John Schoennauer, and Prussian immigrant, Ida Amalia Ottilie Welk.  Irma\u2019s father was a career typesetter employed by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for most of his life; her mother was a seamstress and clothing designer.  As a teen, Irmgard attended Lincoln High School in Seattle, and graduated from the University of Washington in 1942 with a BA degree in Communications. As a freshman, she was a member of \"Chi of Phrateres,\" a philanthropic-social organization for female college students at the University.\n  \nBorn the year female swimmers became the first American women to achieve full Olympic status, Irma began her competitive swimming career as a child at Green Lake in Seattle, having local swimming champion Helene Madison as her older role model.  Quickly recognized for her natural swimming ability and competitive spirit, Imgard was invited to join the swimming team of the Washington Athletic Club in 1935, soon winning numerous local, regional, statewide, and multi-state telegraph races, and was a member of the 400-yard relay team that won the National Championship in 1938.  Groomed to compete in 1940 Summer Olympics, she continued competitive swimming after the outbreak of World War II, even though the Olympic games were suspended by the IOC.  It is very likely, had it not been for the war, she would have competed on the United States Olympic swim team, possibly alongside peer, Esther Williams of California. \n \nShe made a career as a civil servant for the Federal Government for over 40 years; starting with the Department of the Interior at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state after graduating from college, the Department of the War (Army & Air Force) in California during the latter part of World War II, and the Social Security Administration from about 1953 in various states, including California, Kansas, Maryland and finally Washington, where she retired about 1982.\n\nIrma married Melvin Leroy Cole of Arkansas in 1955 in Ellensburg, Washington.  Because they both worked for the same government agency, after married they rarely resided in the same city.  Although two children were born of this union, partly as a result of this forced separation, they divorced in 1963.  Besides her lifelong interest in swimming, she enjoyed travelling by train (she never got a driver\u2019s license, owned a car, or flew in a plane), investing in real estate, and researching her family history.  Irma died in Tacoma, Washington at the age of 83.  Her body was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, next to her beloved father.

Some breeds from outside the country were introduced in the 1950s but did not bring beneficial results, so the Guizhou is still bred in pure form and is classified as a native breed.\n\nUses\n\nIn plantation areas the horses were used mainly for cultivation and transport. In hilly regions this breed has always been a good pack horse, somewhat smaller than the type used for agricultural purposes. The Guizhou horse is active and vigorous, good for travel in hilly regions, and can trot at a steady speed for long distances. This breed is the main power source for the mountain farmers.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nApproximately half of the Guizhou horses are bay or chestnut, others being gray, black, and dun. This horse is compact and short bodied with a solid build. The head has a straight profile, ears small and set up. In the riding type the neck tends to be sloped, while the pack type has a level neck. The withers are medium in height and length; the chest is of good width and depth; the rump is short and sloping but well muscled; the shoulder is short and tends to be straight. The forelegs have good posture while the hind legs are often sickled; the hoof is solid and tough and shoes are unnecessary even in the mountains. The skin is thin; mane and tail are think. Guizhou horses are willing and obedient and have a kind, patient temperament.\n\nSee also\n\n Chinese Guoxia\n Heihe (horse)\n Lijiang pony\n\nReferences\n\n Hendricks, Bonnie.

The breed is a result of cross breeding between Mongolian, Han and Tibetan horses, and is currently listed as one of the Chinese Indigenous Horse Breeds on the Red List of China\u2019s Indigenous Livestock Breeds. The breed is relatively small, standing between 12 and 12.2 hands, and is used primarily for transportation and draught work. They are used for a variety of tasks in their native environment, including carrying people, goods and as pack animals. The breed is also a ancestor for a number of other Chinese pony breeds, such as the Xilingol, Wat Sili and the Huzhou Pony. The breed has a distinctive conformation, with well-defined withers, short backs and strong, muscular limbs. The Guizhou Pony has a short coat, which varies in color from gray, bay and black, depending upon individual genetics. They often have white markings on their legs, and white around their eyes, muzzle, and on their inner thighs. The Guizhou Pony is able to endure harsh conditions, and despite their small size they are extremely hardy, with good stamina and a willingness to work. The breed is also known to be resilient and resourceful. They are easily trained, with a sensible and kind temperament. Despite a population of between 200 and 300 animals in the early 2000s, the breed has significantly declined in recent times, mainly due to its small population size. They are highly valued by their local owners, and their numbers remain low as they are generally used for urban and rural transportation, and as pack animals. In 2014, the Chinese government included the breed in its National Equestrian Sports Training Base, with the aim of protecting the breed\u2019s genetic diversity and ultimately improving the breed\u2019s population size. Today, a campaign dedicated to the revival of the Guizhou Pony is underway, with the goal of increasing the breed\u2019s population size. In 2017, the Guizhou Provincial Government started a foundation dedicated to the protection and conservation of the breed, and a farm in Beijing has started actively breeding them. The farm is currently home to around 80 ponies. Due to its small size, the Guizhou Pony is not suited for many sports, but these horses are now bred for show jumping and other recreational purposes. The first show was held in 2017 in China for the purpose of promoting the breed. In 2018, a stallion named \u201cKing of the Guizhou\u201d won Best Performance of the Year in the regional show. The Guizhou Pony is an integral part of the cultural history of the region, and is a symbol of strength and durability. The breed is important to the local population, and its revival is vital for the future of the breed.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15149947}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eugene de Kock\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eugene Alexander de Kock (born 29 January 1949) is a former South African Police colonel, torturer, and assassin, active under the apartheid government. Nicknamed \"Prime Evil\" by the press, De Kock was the commanding officer of C10, a counter-insurgency unit of the SAP that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered numerous anti-apartheid activists from the 1980s to the early 1990s. C10's victims included members of the African National Congress.\n\nFollowing South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994, De Kock disclosed the full scope of C10's crimes while testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In 1996, he was tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212\u00a0years in prison. Since beginning his sentence, De Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former State President F. W. de Klerk, of permitting C10's activities. In 2015, he was granted parole, and is currently released .\n\nEarly life and service\nEugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a magistrate and personal friend to former prime minister John Vorster. Vosloo \"Vossie\" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a \"quiet\" boy who \"wasn't a violent person.\" He also recounted how their father, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond, indoctrinated the boys in Afrikaner nationalist ideology and taught them \"strict Afrikaans\" as they grew up.\n\nDe Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in Pretoria at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to Rhodesia's border with Botswana to confront militant ANC incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the South African Defence Force. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in Saldanha Bay because of a stutter, and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the South African Police's uniform branch in the Eastern Cape. \n\nDe Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, De Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant.\n\nIn May 1978, De Kock was transferred to South West Africa and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded Koevoet, an SAP counterinsurgency unit tasked with combating the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) during the South African Border War. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but committed atrocities against civilians and other human rights violations. Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.\n\nVlakplaas\n\nIn 1983, the SAP transferred De Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called Vlakplaas, located  west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10\u2014later known as C1\u2014became a death squad which hunted down and killed opponents of the National Party and the apartheid system.\n\nTRC testimony\nDe Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998, during which he made multiple revelations relating to ANC deaths.\n\nDe Kock has been interviewed a number of times by psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, who ended up releasing a book, A Human Being Died That Night, about her interviews with De Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentencing\nUpon being convicted on 30 October 1996, De Kock was sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison for crimes against humanity. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of a firearm, and fraud. De Kock served his sentence in the C Max section of the Pretoria Central Prison.\n\nImprisonment\nIn a local radio interview in July 2007, De Kock claimed that former president FW de Klerk's hands were \"soaked in blood\" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the anti-apartheid conflict. These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a \"clear conscience\" regarding his time in office.\n\nThe Sunday Independent reported in January 2010 that De Kock was seeking a presidential pardon from President Jacob Zuma in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated De Kock took place in April 2009. A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.\n\nIn 2012, De Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims. In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted De Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown remorse. In February, De Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.\n\nIn September 2014, De Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims. Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.\n\nParole\nJustice Minister Michael Masutha announced on 30 January 2015, that De Kock had been granted parole. At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public. Masutha further said that De Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims. De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.\n\nSee also\nDirk Coetzee\nCraig Williamson\nCivil Cooperation Bureau\nWouter Basson\nLothar Neethling\nJanusz Walu\u015b\nSiphiwe Mvuyane\n\nReferences\n\n1949 births\nSouth African prisoners and detainees\nLiving people\nAfrikaner people\nPolice officers convicted of crimes against humanity\nSouth African people of Dutch descent\nSouth African people convicted of crimes against humanity\nPrisoners and detainees of South Africa\nSouth African police officers convicted of crimes\nPeople who testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)\nTorturers", "machine_text": " Eugene de Kock (born 1960) is a South African former police colonel who was found guilty of a number of human rights violations and sentenced to two life sentences in 1996. Born in Bochum, Pretoria, De Kock had a long career in the South African Police, beginning as a constable in 1978 and eventually reaching the rank of colonel in 1989. De Kock was an active participant in apartheid South Africa's counterterrorism strategy targeted against members of the African National Congress. Formally known as 'Operation Zero', the strategy was implemented in response to a surge in ANC-led unrest in 1989 and 1990. De Kock was the Commanding Officer of the C10 branch of the South African Police and under his direction, C10 conducted a series of raids and executions against members of the ANC and its allies. De Kock was arrested for these activities in 1994 and faced over 100 charges, including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and assault. In 1996, he was found guilty of all these charges and sentenced to two life prison sentences as well as an additional 212 years in prison. He also faced a civil trial in 1997, in which he had to pay millions of dollars in damages to victims of his actions. Due to his extensive cooperation with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, de Kock was considered for amnesty in 2003 and his sentence was eventually reduced to 20 years in 2015. Since his release on parole in October 2015, de Kock has been met with mixed reactions. Some have expressed sympathy towards his efforts to atone for his actions, while others point out that he should still be held responsible for his actions.

Mafia from their ninth studio album, \u00cenapoi \u00cen Viitor (Back To The Future). The song features a guest appearance from Romanian pop singer Loredana Groza. Produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime B.U.G. Mafia collaborator Cristi Dobric\u0103, it was released for digital download through the group's official website on June 29, 2011.\n\nMusically, \"F\u0103r\u0103 Cuvinte\" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a dark, minimalist, drum-heavy production with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence.\n\nDue to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released.\n\nBackground \n\nThe official version premiered through B.U.G. Mafia's official website. It was produced by member and founder Vlad \"Tataee\" Irimia, who is known for producing and overseeing every group release since their 1995 debut, Mafia. In an interview with Romanian TV station 1Music Channel, Tataee revealed that, after their 1998 collaboration with Loredana Groza, there had been talks about a new track ever since the mid-2000s, but this was the project that he felt she would be most appropriate to work with on. Groza herself told 1Music that she was excited to work with the group again and that she was anxious to hear reactions from their fans. The song features three verses, each from a group member talking about frustration that arises from dealing with selfishness and human nature altogether.\n\nMusic video \n\nThe video was shot with Alex Ceau\u0219u, the director behind \"C\u00e2t po\u021bi tu de tare\" (The Best You Can Be) and \"\u00cen Anii Ce-au Trecut\". The video also premiered on June 29, 2011.\n\nThe video begins with an introduction of actors Drago\u015f Bucur and Mirela Opri\u015for, who portray an average Romanian family, driving along on a country road while their infant child starts crying in the back of the car. As they start talking and try to comfort their child, they lose control of the car, go on the wrong lane and, as they try to avoid a collision with a truck, they roll over and crash the car. The video then cuts to the crash site with the two parents struggling to get out of the vehicle. As they desperately try to escape and call an emergency service, people start approaching the car, apparently to help them, but as they come closer to the car, they start robbing the two of all their possessions. The video alternates with shots of the group's members reciting their verses and the two characters struggling in agony as witnesses take part in a bizarre bystander effect, not only avoiding to help the two, but taking every valuable object they can find in the car in a scene reminiscent of the 2005 Andrew Niccol drama, Lord of War, meant to portray the absurde implications that poverty casts upon society. The finale reveals the ending of a skillfully crafted dream sequence, as Mirela Opri\u015for's character suddenly wakes up and comes to realize that she was having a nightmare in the car. The couple is listening to B.U.G. Mafia's previous collaboration with Loredana Groza, a 1998 single called \"Lumea e a mea\" (The World Is Mine) in the car.\n\nAccording to Tataee, the video was shot in two locations, one a Bucharest IMGB warehouse and the other an abandoned monastery in Chiajna.\n\nTrack listing \n Digital single\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n B.U.G Mafia official download page.\n\n2011 singles\nB.U.G.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Seismometer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A seismometer is an instrument that responds to ground noises and shaking such as caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and explosions. They are usually combined with a timing device and a recording device to form a seismograph. The output of such a device\u2014formerly recorded on paper (see picture) or film, now recorded and processed digitally\u2014is a seismogram. Such data is used to locate and characterize earthquakes, and to study the Earth's internal structure.\n\nBasic principles\n\nA simple seismometer, sensitive to up-down motions of the Earth, is like a weight hanging from a spring, both suspended from a frame that moves along with any motion detected. The relative motion between the weight (called the mass) and the frame provides a measurement of the vertical ground motion. A rotating drum is attached to the frame and a pen is attached to the weight, thus recording any ground motion in a seismogram.\n\nAny movement from the ground moves the frame.  The mass tends not to move because of its inertia, and by measuring the movement between the frame and the mass, the motion of the ground can be determined.\n\nEarly seismometers used optical levers or mechanical linkages to amplify the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper. Modern instruments use electronics.  In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless relative to the frame by an electronic negative feedback loop.  The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is the output of the seismometer, which is recorded digitally.\n\nIn other systems the weight is allowed to move, and its motion produces an electrical charge in a coil attached to the mass which voltage moves through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame. This design is often used in a geophone, which is used in exploration for oil and gas.\n\nSeismic observatories usually have instruments measuring three axes: north-south (y-axis), east-west (x-axis), and vertical (z-axis). If only one axis is measured, it is usually the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.\n\nThe foundation of a seismic station is critical. A professional station is sometimes mounted on bedrock.  The best mountings may be in deep boreholes, which avoid thermal effects, ground noise and tilting from weather and tides.  Other instruments are often mounted in insulated enclosures on small buried piers of unreinforced concrete. Reinforcing rods and aggregates would distort the pier as the temperature changes.  A site is always surveyed for ground noise with a temporary installation before pouring the pier and laying conduit. Originally, European seismographs were placed in a particular area after a destructive earthquake. Today, they are spread to provide appropriate coverage (in the case of weak-motion seismology) or concentrated in high-risk regions (strong-motion seismology).\n\nNomenclature\n\nThe word derives from the Greek \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, seism\u00f3s, a shaking or quake, from the verb \u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03c9, se\u00ed\u014d, to shake; and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, m\u00e9tron, to measure, and was coined by David Milne-Home in 1841, to describe an instrument designed by Scottish physicist James David Forbes.\n\nSeismograph is another Greek term from seism\u00f3s and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9, gr\u00e1ph\u014d, to draw.  It is often used to mean seismometer, though it is more applicable to the older instruments in which the measuring and recording of ground motion were combined, than to modern systems, in which these functions are separated. Both types provide a continuous record of ground motion; this record distinguishes them from seismoscopes, which merely indicate that motion has occurred, perhaps with some simple measure of how large it was.\n\nThe technical discipline concerning such devices is called seismometry, a branch of seismology.\n\nThe concept of measuring the \"shaking\" of something means that the word \"seismograph\" might be used in a more general sense.  For example, a monitoring station that tracks changes in electromagnetic noise affecting amateur radio waves presents an rf seismograph.  And helioseismology studies the \"quakes\" on the Sun.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first seismometer was made in China during the 2nd century. It was invented by Zhang Heng, a Chinese mathematician and astronomer. The first Western description of the device comes from the French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille in 1703. The modern seismometer was developed in the 19th century.\n\nLuigi Palmieri invented an electromagnetic seismograph in 1856 that could record the time of an earthquake.\n\nIn December 2018, a seismometer was deployed on the planet Mars by the InSight lander, the first time a seismometer was placed onto the surface of another planet.\n\nAncient era\n\nIn AD 132, Zhang Heng of China's Han dynasty invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above), which was called Houfeng Didong Yi (translated as, \"instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth\"). The description we have, from the History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls.  When there was an earthquake, one of the dragons' mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly \"somewhere in the east\". Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.\n\nModern designs\n\nBy the 13th century, seismographic devices existed in the Maragheh observatory in Persia. French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille built one in 1703, and James Lind built one (known as an earthquake machine) in the late 1790s.\n\nAfter 1880, most seismometers were descended from those developed by the team of John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray, who worked as foreign-government advisors in Japan from 1880 to 1895.  These seismometers used damped horizontal pendulums.  After World War II, these were adapted into the widely used Press-Ewing seismometer.\n\nAn early special-purpose seismometer consisted of a large, stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom.  As the earth started to move, the heavy mass of the pendulum had the inertia to stay still within the frame.  The result is that the stylus scratched a pattern corresponding with the Earth's movement. This type of strong-motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local quake. Such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further analysis was performed in the 1980s, using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.\n\nLater, professional suites of instruments for the worldwide standard seismographic network had one set of instruments tuned to oscillate at fifteen seconds, and the other at ninety seconds, each set measuring in three directions.  Amateurs or observatories with limited means tuned their smaller, less sensitive instruments to ten seconds.\nThe basic damped horizontal pendulum seismometer swings like the gate of a fence.  A heavy weight is mounted on the point of a long (from 10\u00a0cm to several meters) triangle, hinged at its vertical edge.  As the ground moves, the weight stays unmoving, swinging the \"gate\" on the hinge.\n\nThe advantage of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument.  The \"gate\" is slightly tilted, so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position.  The pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds, or once per thirty seconds.  The general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds.  A pan of oil is placed under the arm, and a small sheet of metal mounted on the underside of the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations. The level of oil, position on the arm, and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is \"critical\", that is, almost having oscillation.  The hinge is very low friction, often torsion wires, so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire.  Small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents.\n\nZollner described torsionally suspended horizontal pendulums as early as 1869, but developed them for gravimetry rather than seismometry.\n\nEarly seismometers had an arrangement of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch smoked glass or paper.  Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper.  Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money.  In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected to a pair of differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier.  The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis.  The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with photo-sensitive paper.  The expense of developing photo-sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.\n\nModern instruments\n\nModern instruments use electronic sensors, amplifiers, and recording devices. Most are broadband covering a wide range of frequencies. Some seismometers can measure motions with frequencies from 500\u00a0Hz to 0.00118\u00a0Hz (1/500 = 0.002 seconds per cycle, to 1/0.00118 = 850 seconds per cycle).  The mechanical suspension for horizontal instruments remains the garden-gate described above. Vertical instruments use some kind of constant-force suspension, such as the LaCoste suspension. The LaCoste suspension uses a zero-length spring to provide a long period (high sensitivity). Some modern instruments use a \"triaxial\" or \"Galperin\" design, in which three identical motion sensors are set at the same angle to the vertical but 120 degrees apart on the horizontal. Vertical and horizontal motions can be computed from the outputs of the three sensors.\n\nSeismometers unavoidably introduce some distortion into the signals they measure, but professionally designed systems have carefully characterized frequency transforms.\n\nModern sensitivities come in three broad ranges: geophones, 50 to 750 V/m; local geologic seismographs, about 1,500 V/m; and teleseismographs, used for world survey, about 20,000 V/m. Instruments come in three main varieties: short period, long period and broadband.  The short and long period measure velocity and are very sensitive, however they 'clip' the signal or go off-scale for ground motion that is strong enough to be felt by people.  A 24-bit analog-to-digital conversion channel is commonplace.  Practical devices are linear to roughly one part per million.\n\nDelivered seismometers come with two styles of output: analog and digital. Analog seismographs require analog recording equipment, possibly including an analog-to-digital converter.  The output of a digital seismograph can be simply input to a computer.  It presents the data in a standard digital format (often \"SE2\" over Ethernet).\n\nTeleseismometers\n\nThe modern broadband seismograph can record a very broad range of frequencies.  It consists of a small \"proof mass\", confined by electrical forces, driven by sophisticated electronics.  As the earth moves, the electronics attempt to hold the mass steady through a feedback circuit.  The amount of force necessary to achieve this is then recorded.\n\nIn most designs the electronics holds a mass motionless relative to the frame.  This device is called a \"force balance accelerometer\".  It measures  acceleration instead of velocity of ground movement.  Basically, the distance between the mass and some part of the frame is measured very precisely, by a linear variable differential transformer. Some instruments use a linear variable differential capacitor.\n\nThat measurement is then amplified by electronic amplifiers attached to parts of an electronic negative feedback loop.  One of the amplified currents from the negative feedback loop drives a coil very like a loudspeaker. The result is that the mass stays nearly motionless.\n\nMost instruments measure directly the ground motion using the distance sensor. The voltage generated in a sense coil on the mass by the magnet directly measures the instantaneous velocity of the ground. The current to the drive coil provides a sensitive, accurate measurement of the force between the mass and frame, thus measuring directly the ground's acceleration (using f=ma where f=force, m=mass, a=acceleration).\n\nOne of the continuing problems with sensitive vertical seismographs is the buoyancy of their masses.  The uneven changes in pressure caused by wind blowing on an open window can easily change the density of the air in a room enough to cause a vertical seismograph to show spurious signals.  Therefore, most professional seismographs are sealed in rigid gas-tight enclosures.  For example, this is why a common Streckeisen model has a thick glass base that must be glued to its pier without bubbles in the glue.\n\nIt might seem logical to make the heavy magnet serve as a mass, but that subjects the seismograph to errors when the Earth's magnetic field moves.  This is also why seismograph's moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields.  A seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as nonmagnetic invar.\n\nThe hinges on a seismograph are usually patented, and by the time the patent has expired, the design has been improved.  The most successful public domain designs use thin foil hinges in a clamp.\n\nAnother issue is that the transfer function of a seismograph must be accurately characterized, so that its frequency response is known.  This is often the crucial difference between professional and amateur instruments.  Most instruments are characterized on a variable frequency shaking table.\n\nStrong-motion seismometers\nAnother type of seismometer is a digital strong-motion seismometer, or accelerograph. The data from such an instrument is essential to understand how an earthquake affects man-made structures, through earthquake engineering. The recordings of such instruments are crucial for the assessment of seismic hazard, through engineering seismology.\n\nA strong-motion seismometer measures acceleration. This can be mathematically integrated later to give velocity and position. Strong-motion seismometers are not as sensitive to ground motions as teleseismic instruments but they stay on scale during the strongest seismic shaking.\n\nStrong motion sensors are used for intensity meter applications.\n\nOther forms\n\nAccelerographs and geophones are often heavy cylindrical magnets with a spring-mounted coil inside.  As the case moves, the coil tends to stay stationary, so the magnetic field cuts the wires, inducing current in the output wires.  They receive frequencies from several hundred hertz down to 1\u00a0Hz.  Some have electronic damping, a low-budget way to get some of the performance of the closed-loop wide-band geologic seismographs.\n\nStrain-beam accelerometers constructed as integrated circuits are too insensitive for geologic seismographs (2002), but are widely used in geophones.\n\nSome other sensitive designs measure the current generated by the flow of a non-corrosive ionic fluid through an electret sponge or a conductive fluid through a magnetic field.\n\nInterconnected seismometers\nSeismometers spaced in a seismic array can also be used to precisely locate, in three dimensions, the source of an earthquake, using the time it takes for seismic waves to propagate away from the hypocenter, the initiating point of fault rupture (See also Earthquake location).  Interconnected seismometers are also used, as part of the International Monitoring System to detect underground nuclear test explosions, as well as for Earthquake early warning systems. These seismometers are often used as part of a large scale governmental or scientific project, but some organizations such as the Quake-Catcher Network, can use residential size detectors built into computers to detect earthquakes as well.\n\nIn reflection seismology, an array of seismometers image sub-surface features.  The data are reduced to images using algorithms similar to tomography.  The data reduction methods resemble those of computer-aided tomographic medical imaging X-ray machines (CAT-scans), or imaging sonars.\n\nA worldwide array of seismometers can actually image the interior of the Earth in wave-speed and transmissivity.  This type of system uses events such as earthquakes, impact events or nuclear explosions as wave sources.  The first efforts at this method used manual data reduction from paper seismograph charts.  Modern digital seismograph records are better adapted to direct computer use.  With inexpensive seismometer designs and internet access, amateurs and small institutions have even formed a \"public seismograph network\".\n\nSeismographic systems used for petroleum or other mineral exploration historically used an explosive and a wireline of geophones unrolled behind a truck.  Now most short-range systems use \"thumpers\" that hit the ground, and some small commercial systems have such good digital signal processing that a few sledgehammer strikes provide enough signal for short-distance refractive surveys.  Exotic cross or two-dimensional arrays of geophones are sometimes used to perform three-dimensional reflective imaging of subsurface features.  Basic linear refractive geomapping software (once a black art) is available off-the-shelf, running on laptop computers, using strings as small as three geophones.  Some systems now come in an 18\" (0.5 m) plastic field case with a computer, display and printer in the cover.\n\nSmall seismic imaging systems are now sufficiently inexpensive to be used by civil engineers to survey foundation sites, locate bedrock, and find subsurface water.\n\nFiber optic cables as seismometers \nA new technique for detecting earthquakes has been found, using fiber optic cables.\nIn 2016 a team of metrologists running frequency metrology experiments in England observed noise with a wave-form resembling the seismic waves generated by earthquakes. This was found to match seismological observations of an  earthquake in Italy, ~1400\u00a0km away. Further experiments in England, Italy, and with a submarine fiber optic cable to Malta detected additional earthquakes, including one 4,100\u00a0km away, and an  earthquake 89\u00a0km away from the cable.\n\nSeismic waves are detectable because they cause micrometer-scale changes in the length of the cable. As the length changes so does the time it takes a packet of light to traverse to the far end of the cable and back (using a second fiber). Using ultra-stable metrology-grade lasers, these extremely minute shifts of timing (on the order of femtoseconds) appear as phase-changes.\n\nThe point of the cable first disturbed by an earthquake's p-wave (essentially a sound wave in rock) can be determined by sending packets in both directions in the looped pair of optical fibers; the difference in the arrival times of the first pair of perturbed packets indicates the distance along the cable. This point is also the point closest to the earthquake's epicenter, which should be on a plane perpendicular to the cable. The difference between the p-wave/s-wave arrival times provides a distance (under ideal conditions), constraining the epicenter to a circle. A second detection on a non-parallel cable is needed to resolve the ambiguity of the resulting solution. Additional observations constrain the location of the earthquake's epicenter, and may resolve the depth.\n\nThis technique is expected to be a boon in observing earthquakes, especially the smaller ones, in vast portions of the global ocean where there are no seismometers, and at a cost much cheaper than ocean bottom seismometers.\n\nRecording\n\nToday, the most common recorder is a computer with an analog-to-digital converter, a disk drive and an internet connection; for amateurs, a PC with a sound card and associated software is adequate. Most systems record continuously, but some record only when a signal is detected,\nas shown by a short-term increase in the variation of the signal, compared to its long-term\naverage (which can vary slowly because of changes in seismic noise), also known as a STA/LTA trigger.\n\nPrior to the availability of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media. A \"Helicorder\" drum was a device used to record data into photographic paper or in the form of paper and ink. A \"Develocorder\" was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film. The recorded film can be viewed by a machine. The reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand. After the digital processing has been used, the archives of the seismic data were recorded in magnetic tapes. Due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias, large number of waveforms from the archives are not recoverable.\n\nSee also\nAccelerometer\nGalitzine, Boris Borisovich\nGeophone\nInge Lehmann\nIRIS Consortium\nJohn Milne\nPacific Northwest Seismic Network\nPlate tectonics\nQuake-Catcher Network\nRichard Dixon Oldhamn\nRichter magnitude scale\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nThe history of early seismometers\n The Lehman amateur seismograph, from Scientific American- not designed for calibrated measurement.\n Sean Morrisey's professional design of an amateur teleseismograph Also see Keith Payea's version Both accessed 2010-9-29 Morrissey was a professional seismographic instrument engineer.

The device is typically composed of a strong base and a seismometer, which typically uses a weight and pendulum to detect vibrations in the ground. Seismometers are important tools in seismology, a branch of geophysics that studies earthquakes and their waves. Seismometer readings are used to understand more about the nature of earthquakes and other seismic events, and to predict potential disasters. The earliest seismometers were based on a tilt sensor that measured the angle of the ground relative to the horizon, then converting the measured tilt into a proportion of the intensity and magnitude of an earthquake. This type of device was used by the ancient Chinese to measure earthquakes in the second century BC. Modern seismometers, however, have undergone a significant evolution. Digital seismometers, also known as digital seismographs, are much more advanced than their predecessors. They utilize a variety of methods, including motion sensors and accelerometers, for measuring ground motion generated by seismic waves. Different types of digital seismometers have various capabilities, with some being able to measure both horizontal (from side to side) and vertical (from top to bottom) motion. Modern seismometers are also very sensitive in order to accurately measure motion, and can detect vibrations that are partially caused by human activities such as construction and traffic. They can also detect ground tremors caused by natural phenomena such as landslides and earthquakes. This information can be used by seismologists and engineers to understand more about the underlying causes of an earthquake and to make predictions about future seismic events. Seismometers are also helpful in detecting underground nuclear tests and other activities of humans. The data collected by the seismometer can be used to detect any potential nuclear tests that are conducted underground, therefore helping to reduce the chance of an international nuclear incident. In addition to providing seismic information, seismometers can also be used in energy exploration. By detecting vibrations from deep beneath the surface of the Earth, seismometers can help detect underground deposits of oil and gas. This type of data can be used for geologic mapping and for locating areas of high petroleum potential. Seismometers are an invaluable device for usage in research, energy exploration, and for predicting the effects of seismic activity. As technology develops and becomes more advanced, the capabilities of seismometers have also greatly improved. They have become an essential tool in the fields of geophysics, energy exploration, and in helping to protect humans from harm caused by natural phenomena such as earthquakes.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 231826}

The Salton Sea was originally created as an accident when the Colorado River flooded in the spring of 1905. Consequently, it rapidly filled in an area of the desert that had been dry for centuries and became a natural wonder known as the Salton Sea. Prior to the accidental filling of the Salton Sea, this area was an almost apocalyptic wasteland featuring scorching temperatures and barren land. The salty body of water quickly began to attract birds and fish and over the years became a fisherman\u2019s paradise, as well as a sought-after destination for birdwatchers. The fresh water provided life to the formerly desolate landscape. In the early 1940s, the nearby town of Salton City was born to capitalize on the newfound wealth, and with it the rise of the Salton Sea. For the first few decades of the Salton Sea's existence, it was understandably seen as a miracle in the desert, albeit a short lived one. However, over time, the water of the Salton Sea began to fill up with salts and minerals from the Colorado River, making it increasingly more saline. In the late 1950s, rising salinity levels began to take a toll on the Sea's inhabitants, resulting in the decreasing abundance of game fish and migratory birds, and eventually leading to the complete disappearance of certain species. Over time, the rising salinity levels of the Salton Sea continued to worsen and it passed the minimum safe threshold for healthy freshwater fish. The sea was in danger of becoming a desolate wasteland once again, with minimal life inhabiting its shores. Residents of nearby towns, in an effort to try and save the popular body of water, attempted to restore the Salton Sea with fresh water sources, but due to the cost and complexity of the project, few meaningful improvements were ever made. In the end, the miracle in the desert known as the Salton Sea eventually met its demise. The increasing salinity levels combined with significantly reduced inflow from the Colorado River caused an unexpected and irrevocable change that, in the end, could not be saved. Today, the former miracle of the desert stands as a reminder of what once was.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 64258200}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paris meridian\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Paris meridian is a meridian line running through the Paris Observatory in Paris, France \u2013 now longitude 2\u00b020\u203214.02500\u2033 East. It was a long-standing rival to the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian of the world. The \"Paris meridian arc\" or \"French meridian arc\" (French: la M\u00e9ridienne de France) is the name of the meridian arc measured along the Paris meridian. \n\nThe French meridian arc was important for French cartography, inasmuch as the triangulations of France began with the measurement of the French meridian arc. Moreover, the French meridian arc was important for geodesy as it was one of the meridian arcs which were measured in order to determine the figure of the Earth via the arc measurement method. The determination of the figure of the Earth was a problem of the highest importance in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the Earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.\n\nHistory\n\nFrench cartography and the figure of the Earth \n\nIn the year 1634, France ruled by Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, decided that the Ferro meridian should be used as the reference on maps, since El Hierro (Ferro) was the most western position of the Ptolemy's world map. It was also thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of Paris. The astronomers of the French Academy of Sciences, founded in 1666, managed to clarify the position of El Hierro relative to the meridian of Paris, which gradually supplanted the Ferro meridian. In 1666, Louis XIV of France had authorized the building of the Paris Observatory. On Midsummer's Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building's outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north\u2013south. French cartographers would use it as their prime meridian for more than 200 years. Old maps from continental Europe often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom.\n\nA French astronomer, Abb\u00e9 Jean Picard, measured the length of a degree of latitude along the Paris meridian (arc measurement) and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1668\u20131670. The application of the telescope to angular instruments was an important step. He was the first who in 1669, with the telescope, using such precautions as the nature of the operation requires, measured a precise arc of meridian (Picard's arc measurement). He measured with wooden rods a baseline of 5,663 toises, and a second or base of verification of 3,902 toises; his triangulation network extended from Malvoisine, near Paris, to Sourdon, near Amiens. The angles of the triangles were measured with a quadrant furnished with a telescope having cross-wires. The difference of latitude of the terminal stations was determined by observations made with a sector on a star in Cassiopeia, giving 1\u00b0 22\u2032 55\u2033 for the amplitude. The terrestrial degree measurement gave the length of 57,060 toises, whence he inferred 6,538,594 toises for the Earth's diameter.\n\nFour generations of the Cassini family headed the Paris Observatory. They directed the surveys of France for over 100 years. Hitherto geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the magnitude of the Earth considered as a sphere, but a discovery made by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form. This astronomer, having been sent by the Academy of Sciences of Paris to the island of Cayenne (now in French Guiana) in South America, for the purpose of investigating the amount of astronomical refraction and other astronomical objects, observed that his clock, which had been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes and a half daily at Cayenne, and that in order to bring it to measure mean solar time it was necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line (about 1\u204412th of an in.). This fact, which was scarcely credited till it had been confirmed by the subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes on the coasts of Africa and America, was first explained in the third book of Newton\u2019s Principia, who showed that it could only be referred to a diminution of gravity arising either from a protuberance of the equatorial parts of the Earth and consequent increase of the distance from the centre, or from the counteracting effect of the centrifugal force. About the same time (1673) appeared Christiaan Huygens\u2019 De Horologio Oscillatorio, in which for the first time were found correct notions on the subject of centrifugal force. It does not, however, appear that they were applied to the theoretical investigation of the figure of the Earth before the publication of Newton's Principia. In 1690 Huygens published his De Causa Gravitatis, which contains an investigation of the figure of the Earth on the supposition that the attraction of every particle is towards the centre. \n\nBetween 1684 and 1718 Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Jacques Cassini, along with Philippe de La Hire, carried a triangulation, starting from Picard's base in Paris and extending it northwards to Dunkirk and southwards to Collioure. They measured a base of 7,246 toises near Perpignan, and a somewhat shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had an amplitude of 2\u00b0 12\u2032 9\u2033, obtained 56,960 toises for the length of a degree; while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6\u00b0 18\u2032 57\u2033, they obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, with the degree diminishing with increasing latitude, the Earth must be a prolate spheroid. This conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of Newton and Huygens, and accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other \u2014 one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a high latitude. Thus arose the celebrated , to the Equator and to Lapland, the latter directed by Pierre Louis Maupertuis.\n\nIn 1740 an account was published in the Paris M\u00e9moires, by Cassini de Thury, of a remeasurement by himself and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille of the meridian of Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five stations. The results previously obtained by Giovanni Domenico and Jacques Cassini were not confirmed, but, on the contrary, the length of the degree derived from these partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with increasing latitude.\n\nThe West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc \nCesar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de Thury completed the Cassini map, which was published by his son Cassini IV in 1790. Moreover, the Paris meridian was linked with international collaboration in geodesy and metrology. Cesar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de Thury (1714-1784) expressed the project to extend the French geodetic network all around the world and to connect the Paris and Greenwich observatories. In 1783 the French Academy of Science presented his proposal to King George III. This connection and a proposal from General William Roy led to the first triangulation of Great Britain. France and Great Britain surveys' connection was repeated by French astronomers and geodesists in 1787 by Cassini IV, in 1823-1825 by Fran\u00e7ois Arago and in 1861-1862 by Fran\u00e7ois Perrier.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1798 Pierre M\u00e9chain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre surveyed the Paris meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona (see meridian arc of Delambre and M\u00e9chain). They extrapolated from this measurement the distance from the North Pole to the Equator which was 5 130 740 toises. As the metre had to be equal to one ten-millionth of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,296 lignes of the Toise of Peru (see below) and of the double-toise N\u00b0 1 of the apparatus which had been devised by Lavoisier and Borda for this survey at specified temperatures.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Paris meridian's arc was recalculated with greater precision between Shetland and the Balearic Islands by the astronomer Fran\u00e7ois Arago, whose name now appears on the plaques or medallions tracing the route of the meridian through Paris (see below). Biot and Arago published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of \"Bases du syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique d\u00e9cimal ou mesure de l'arc m\u00e9ridien compris entre les parall\u00e8les de Dunkerque et Barcelone\" (Basis for the decimal metric system or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona) by Delambre and M\u00e9chain.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero directed the survey of Spain. From 1870 to 1894 the Paris meridan's arc was remeasured by Perrier and Bassot in France and Algeria.  In 1879, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero for Spain and Fran\u00e7ois Perrier for France directed the junction of the Spanish geodetic network with Algeria.  This connection was a remarkable enterprise where triangles with a maximum length of 270\u00a0km were observed from mountain stations over the Mediterranean Sea. The triangulation of France was then connected to those of Great Britain, Spain and Algeria and thus the Paris meridian's arc measurement extended from Shetland to the Sahara.\n\nThe fundamental co-ordinates of the Panth\u00e9on were also obtained anew, by connecting the Panth\u00e9on and the Paris Observatory with the five stations of Bry-sur-Marne, Morlu, Mont Val\u00e9rien, Chatillon and Montsouris, where the observations of latitude and azimuth were effected.\n\nGeodesy and metrology \nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Wilhelm von Struve invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52\u00b0 and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. Notably the geodetic standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the toise, of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for Bouguer and De La Condamine as their standard of reference in the French Geodesic Mission, conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa.\n\nAlexander Ross Clarke and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung and the General Conference of the association proposed the metre as a uniform length standard for the Arc measurement and recommended the establishment of an International Metre Commission.\n\nThe Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Metre Convention was signed in 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. The first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures was the Spanish geodesist Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the International Geodetic Association (German: Internationale Erdmessung) and Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the International Geodetic Association gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung proposed to select the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian in the hope that Great Britain would accede to the Metre Convention.\n\nFrom the Paris meridian to the Greenwich meridian \nThe United States passed an Act of Congress on 3 August 1882, authorizing President Chester A. Arthur to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world. Before the invitations were sent out on December 1, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways' General Time Convention and Managing Editor of the Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways, had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883 across the nation. Although this was not legally established until 1918, there was thus a strong sense of fait accompli that preceded the International Meridian Conference, although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference.\n\nIn 1884, at the International Meridian Conference in Washington DC, the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the prime meridian of the world. San Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against. France and Brazil abstained. The United Kingdom acceded to the Metre Convention in 1884 and to the International Geodetic Association in 1898. In 1911, Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert stated in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica :\n\n\"According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, a [the equatorial radius of the Earth] = 6,377,935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15. [...] The net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the meridian of Greenwich is nearer the mean than that of Paris (Helmert, Gr\u00f6sse d. Erde).\"\n\nThe French clung to the Paris meridian as a rival to Greenwich until 1911 for timekeeping purposes and 1914 for navigation. To this day, French cartographers continue to indicate the Paris meridian on some maps.\n\nFrom wireless telegraphy to Coordinated Universal Time \nWith the arrival of wireless telegraphy, France established a transmitter on the Eiffel Tower in order to broadcast a time signal. The creation of the International Time Bureau, seated at the Paris Observatory, was decided upon during the 1912 Conf\u00e9rence internationale de l'heure radiot\u00e9l\u00e9graphique. The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an international convention. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of World War I. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the International Commission of Time, one of the commissions of the then newly founded International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nFrom 1956 until 1987 the International Time Bureau was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of Atomic Time were taken over by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the celestial reference frame and the Earth's rotation in order to realize the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) were taken over by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) which was established in its present form in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).\n\nThe Arago medallions \n\nIn 1994 the Arago Association and the city of Paris commissioned a Dutch conceptual artist, Jan Dibbets, to create a memorial to Arago.  Dibbets came up with the idea of setting 135 bronze medallions (although only 121 are documented in the official guide to the medallions) into the ground along the Paris meridian between the northern and southern limits of Paris: a total distance of 9.2 kilometres/5.7 miles. Each medallion is 12\u00a0cm in diameter and marked with the name ARAGO plus N and S pointers.\n\nAnother project, the Green Meridian (An 2000 \u2014 La M\u00e9ridienne Verte), aimed to establish a plantation of trees along the entire length of the meridian arc in France. Several missing Arago medallions appear to have been replaced with the newer 'An 2000 \u2014 La M\u00e9ridienne Verte' markers.\n\nEsoteric interpretations \n\nIn certain circles, some kind of occult or esoteric significance is ascribed to the Paris meridian; sometimes it is even perceived as a sinister axis. Dominique Stezepfandts, a French conspiracy theorist, attacks the Arago medallions that supposedly trace the route of \"an occult geographical line\". To him the Paris meridian is a \"Masonic axis\" or even \"the heart of the Devil.\"\n\nHenry Lincoln, in his book The Holy Place, argues that various ancient structures are aligned according to the Paris meridian. They even include medieval churches, built long before the meridian was established according to conventional history, and Lincoln finds it obvious that the meridian \"was based upon the 'cromlech intersect division line'.\" David Wood, in his book Genesis, likewise ascribes a deeper significance to the Paris meridian and takes it into account when trying to decipher the geometry of the myth-encrusted village of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau: The meridian passes about 350 metres (1,150\u00a0ft) west of the site of the so-called \"Poussin tomb,\" an important location in the legends and esoteric theories relating to that place. A sceptical discussion of these theories, including the supposed alignments, can be found in Bill Putnam and Edwin Wood's book The Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau - A mystery solved.\n\nThe meridian line, dubbed the \"Rose Line\" by author Dan Brown appeared in the novel The Da Vinci Code.\n\nSee also \n French cartography\n Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790)\n Principal Triangulation of Great Britain\n Meridian arc\n History of geodesy\nHistory of the metre\nSeconds pendulum\n Struve Geodetic Arc\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n   Better formatted mathematics at Wikisource.\n The Arago medallions on Google Earth\n Full Meridian of Glory: Perilous Adventures in the Competition to Measure the Earth: history of science book by Prof. Paul Murdin\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian, by Graham Dolan\n\nNamed meridians\nGeography of Paris\nGeography of France\nHistory of Paris\nPrime meridians\nGeodesy\nMetrology\nGeography of England\nGeography of Spain\nGeography of Algeria\nParis Observatory", "machine_text": " The Paris Meridian (Meridian of Paris) is a line of longitude that runs through the French Capital of Paris, is the zero degree reference line for all French cartography, and is described as being at 30 minutes longitude east of Greenwich. Its origin dates back to the year 1666, when Louis XIV commissioned the astronomer Jean Picard to carry out a survey of the entire kingdom of France. During this survey, Picard chose the Observatory of Paris as the center of his measurements. The result was the establishment of the Paris Meridian, set at two degrees east of Greenwich. The Paris Meridian was used by cartographers to construct the official map of France in 1790. On the map of France, the 0 degree mark of this meridian ran from north to south, where it split the country into two equal parts. The meridian has subsequently been used to divide France into d\u00e9partements and as the baseline for the national grid system of metric coordinates. For the international community, the Paris Meridian was initially used as the standard of reference for longitude in 1884, when the International Meridian Conference agreed to adopt the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian for the world. Before the agreement, the location of the prime meridian was not consistently agreed upon and there were numerous suggestions of alternative prime meridians. One of these was the Paris Meridian, which was a highly suitable alternative, given that it was both known and had an easy to construct zero meridian passing through the principal city of a civilized nation. At the International Meridian Conference, William Ferrel, a meteorologist, argued in favor of Paris being used as the prime meridian, rather than Greenwich. However, Greenwich eventually won out by 26 votes, 13 to 10, over other contenders such as the Paris Meridian, Ferro Island and the Ile de France. Nevertheless, the Paris Meridian is still used as the zero degree reference line for French cartography. In Paris, there is a bronze line in the pavement which encircles the Observatory of Paris and marks the exact spot of the zero degree line of the Paris Meridian. In 2011, this spot served as one of the highlights of celebrations for the 375th anniversary of the Paris meridian, organized by the Paris Geographical Society. The Paris Meridian has been a source of much debate in the world of geography. In 1747, it was the center of a debate between Jean-Dominique Cassini and Pierre-Charles Br\u00fchl on the calculation of longitudes, which has been referred to as the \"Paris Meridian Affair\". The debate had implications for maritime navigation and the resolution of the dispute between the two men was a watershed moment in the development of geodesy and cartography. Today, the reference of the Paris Meridian has reduced in importance due to the widespread adoption of GPS for navigation and other applications. Nevertheless, it is still used in many parts of the world and its significance in French cartography and geodetic history remains.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2770302}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ducati Desmosedici\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ducati Desmosedici is a four-stroke V4 engine racing motorcycle made by Ducati for MotoGP racing. The series nomenclature is GP with the two-digit year appended, such as Desmosedici GP10 for 2010. In 2006 Ducati made a short production run of 1,500 street-legal variants, the Desmosedici RR.\n\nBackground \nDucati abandoned the Grand Prix racing scene at the start of the 1970s. For many years the 500 class was essentially a class for two-stroke motorcycles, an engineering technology that was far removed from the four-stroke road-going machines sold by Ducati. Technical rules changed in 2002, giving priority to four-stroke machinery and turning the 500 class of World Road Racing into the MotoGP Championship. This convinced Ducati to make a much-awaited return to the track in the new MotoGP class.\n\nDucati history is classically based on 90\u00b0 V-twin (or L-twin) engines, using desmodromic valve technology. Initially, Ducati considered the possibility of creating a MotoGP 'super-twin', taking advantage of the MotoGP regulations that give twin-cylinder machines a considerable weight reduction over four, five or six-cylinder bikes. However, analysis indicated that a twin-cylinder engine would not have been able to produce the required amount of power, without excessively increasing the number of revs. A twin would have had to rev at over 17,000\u00a0rpm, but this would require a very short stroke and a very large bore, as a result producing possible combustion problems.\n\nThe basis of the design of the Desmosedici engine therefore is two classical Ducati L-twins next to each other, making a Double L-twin with two-cylinder Stroking at the same time (also called Twin Pulse). With four valves per cylinder, the total number of valves is sixteen \u2013 Desmosedici means desmodromic distribution with sixteen valves shortened in Italian.\n\nDesign had started in 2001, the bike was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the following seasons MotoGP World Championship. Vittoriano Guareschi, the Ducati Corse test-rider, followed every phase of the Desmosedici's development process from early testing to track debut and the project's evolution. In 2007, Ducati's pilot Casey Stoner, riding a Desmosedici, obtained Ducati's first MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nIn early 2021, Ducati rider Johann Zarco set the highest trap speed record in competition practice on the Desmosedici.\n\nGP3 \nWhile still fully committed to Superbike racing, the Ducati Marlboro Team of Loris Capirossi and Troy Bayliss would compete in all rounds of the 2003 MotoGP championship. The Desmosedici GP3 quickly scored a series of results with Loris Capirossi, who stepped onto the podium in the opening round of the championship in Japan and won the GP Catalunya in Barcelona. Riders Capirossi finished fourth in the final championship standings and Bayliss sixth; while Ducati finished second overall in the Manufacturers' standings.\n\nGP4 \nIn 2004 the Desmosedici GP4, again in the hands of Capirossi and Bayliss, underwent a series of major modifications. A large part of the season went by before the bike became competitive, but the season concluded with both riders on the podium.\n\nGP5 \n\nThe GP5 version lined up for Ducati's third season in MotoGP, with Bayliss replaced by the Spanish rider Carlos Checa. Thanks to a collaboration agreement with Bridgestone, Ducati could finally contribute to the development of new tyres and by the end of the season the Desmosedici became a competitive machine. Bridgestone found that hard tyres suited the bike more than softer tyres to create grip, allowing it to spin the rear wheel gave better control. Capirossi took two wins in the Grand Prix of Japan at Motegi and in the Malaysian GP at Sepang, while Checa scored a brace of podium finishes.\n\nGP6 \nLaunched at the Italian skiing resort of Madonna di Campiglio, the GP6 is a lighter and more powerful version of the GP5. Involving better aerodynamics and a better fuel tank position, most importantly, although more powerful, the engine delivery was smoothened to make the bike more rideable. This made the bike slower on top speed, but quicker into, around and out of corners.\n\nThe new rider with Capirossi was Spanish rider Sete Gibernau. After encouraging winter tests, the Desmosedici GP6 took its first win of 2006 in the opening GP at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, followed by a podium in Qatar. Capirossi led the championship for a short while, but at the start of the Grand prix de Catalunya at Barcelona, Gibernau's bike collided with Capirossi's after Gibernau braked too late and compressed his brake lever further after impacting it on the back of Capirossi's bike. Both riders ended up injured and in the hospital, with Gibernau sustaining a broken collar bone, and both missed the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen. Capirossi returned at the British Grand Prix, while Gibernau was replaced by German Alex Hofmann for the Dutch Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, and also the Czech Grand Prix after undergoing additional surgery. With Gibernau  sidelined for the final round of the season at Valencia following a collision with Casey Stoner, Ducati recalled Bayliss, who was recently crowned World Superbike champion. The race was won by Bayliss, his first MotoGP victory, with Capirossi taking second place for the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish.\n\nGP7 \nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to cap motors to a maximum displacement of 800\u00a0cc. In response, Ducati built the GP7. Its specifications were: 800\u00a0cc bike, double L-Twin motor (4 Cylinder Twin Pulse).\n\nDucati started its project to build an 800\u00a0cc MotoGP bike extremely early and according to Ducati's racing chief Filippo Preziosi, by August 2006 Ducati had already built twenty 800\u00a0cc engines with various specifications. In addition, an early version of the bike was track tested for the first time during early May 2006. Public testing with the bike began at the Brno Track, where Loris Capirossi had won the day before riding the GP6, on the 21st of August. Capirossi's lap times on the prototype GP7 were only 1.4 seconds off his track record time set on the 990\u00a0cc GP6.\n\nFurther testing of the GP7 in Motegi, Japan, revealed that the 800\u00a0cc machine could run faster laps than the higher-displacement 990\u00a0cc bikes, and held nearly a second advantage over the next fastest 800\u00a0cc bike, a Honda ridden by Dani Pedrosa.\n\nMotoGP's 800\u00a0cc era officially began with the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed advantage over the rest of the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, realised that \"unfortunately, there was too much difference between (our) bikes in the straight\" and \"Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati.\" These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly by the end of the year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season.\n\nGP8 \n\nAn update of the GP7 design, Ducati's entry for the 2008 MotoGP World Championship was tested first in February 2007.\n\nFor purposes of avoiding chatter which was encountered on some occasions with GP7, the rigidity of the GP8's frame was altered, although further details of relevant modifications are not disclosed. In addition, in an attempt to reduce an effect described as \"pumping\", some modifications to the bike's suspension geometry were made.\n\nAs with its predecessor the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800\u00a0cc engine with desmodromic actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power compared to that of the GP7.\n\nThroughout 2007, Ducati tested a special fuel-saving clutch arrangement which disengaged the clutch during braking and reduced fuel consumption, however the arrangement was not incorporated in the GP8 as various advanced lubricants and fuels used with the GP8 are believed to provide comparable fuel savings, while decreasing internal engine friction and increasing maximum power.\n\nIn race trim, the bike recorded an official top speed of  at the 2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nGP9 \nThe GP9 was Ducati's entry for the 2009 MotoGP World Championship. Ducati began testing it on track prior to May 2008.  On 9 June 2008, Ducati publicly rolled out the Desmosedici GP9 for testing at Circuit de Catalunya.\n\nA distinctive feature of GP9 is its carbon fibre chassis, representing a departure from Ducati's traditional steel trellis chassis. Although carbon fibre chassis were tried in mid 1980s, currently no other MotoGP racing team uses them.\n\nGP10 \nOn January 15, 2010, Ducati introduced the GP10 for the 2010 MotoGP season. Development concentrated on improving engine longevity, to keep within new engine restrictions, and rideability. Most notably, the GP10 makes use of a big-bang firing order for the first time since the Desmosedici changed from the 990\u00a0cc to the 800\u00a0cc engine capacity. Ducati also redesigned the fairing, first seen at the 2009 Estoril round.\n\nGP11 \nOn January 12, 2011, Ducati introduced the GP11 for the 2011 MotoGP season. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP12 \nOn March 19, 2012, Ducati unveiled the GP12 for the 2012 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season which incorporated new displacement standards of up to 1,000\u00a0cc in capacity. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP16 \nThe Desmosedici GP16 was unveiled in February 2016. It ran the first two pre-season tests with race riders Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone without a livery. Ducati's MotoGP boss Gigi Dall'Igna describes the 2016 Desmosedici as an \"evolution\" of its recent challengers. The GP16 was still the fastest bike in a straight line with its extra power. The winglets remained from the previous year, albeit now coloured to match the predominantly white and red Desmosedici.\n\nIn the 10th round of the season in Austria, Ducati dominated all sessions. Andrea Iannone and Andrea Dovizioso qualified 1st and 3rd respectively. In the race, Ducati used their lack of wheelies and extra power to stretch out a gap to Jorge Lorenzo after some laps. The two bikes stayed together, with Dovizioso in first for most of the race. But Iannone out-braked him and took the lead into the penultimate corner of the last lap. The win was the first for Iannone in MotoGP and his first since Moto2 Italy 2012. The win was the first for Ducati (and any other manufacturer than Honda or Yamaha) since Casey Stoner won for the team in 2010 Australian Grand Prix. Dovizioso finished in 2nd place to mark the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish since the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nIn the 17th round of the season at the newly resurfaced Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, Dovizioso took his second pole of the year in wet conditions. At the start, he fell back to 4th while Iannone, who had qualified in 6th place, led briefly before falling to 2nd place. He stayed there till he crashed at Turn 9. That left Valentino Rossi with Dovizioso at the front and Jorge Lorenzo in a distant 3rd place. Rossi ran wide at turn 1 some laps later and fell back by around 1+ seconds per lap. 'DesmoDovi' held on for his first win with Ducati and his first win since his victory at Donington Park with the Repsol Honda Team in 2009.\n\nDesmosedici RR \n\nThe Desmosedici RR is a road-legal version of the Desmosedici, first delivered in early 2008.\n\nComplete MotoGP results\n\nMotorcycle summary\nThese results are accurate up to the 2021 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nWorld Championship titles:\nRiders: 1 (Casey Stoner )\nTeams: 2 (Ducati Marlboro Team , Ducati Lenovo Team )\nConstructors: 3 (, , )\n\nRaces won: 58\n2003: Capirossi 1 (1 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 2 (2 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 3, Bayliss 1 (4 in total)\n2007: Stoner 10, Capirossi 1 (11 in total)\n2008: Stoner 6 (6 in total)\n2009: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2010: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2016: Iannone 1, Dovizioso 1 (2 in total)\n2017: Dovizioso 6 (6 in total)\n2018: Dovizioso 4, Lorenzo 3 (7 in total)\n2019: Dovizioso 2, Petrucci 1 (3 in total)\n2020: Dovizioso 1, Petrucci 1 (2 in total)\n2021: Miller 2, Mart\u00edn 1, Bagnaia 4 (7 in total)\n\nPoles: 55\n2003: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 2, Gibernau 1 (3 in total)\n2007: Stoner 5 (5 in total)\n2008: Stoner 9 (9 in total)\n2009: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2010: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2014: Dovizioso 1 (1 in total)\n2015: Dovizioso 1, Iannone 1 (2 in total)\n2016: Dovizioso 2, Iannone 1 (3 in total)\n2018: Lorenzo 4, Dovizioso 2, Miller 1 (7 in total)\n2020: Zarco 1 (1 in total)\n2021: Bagnaia 6, Mart\u00edn 4, Zarco 1 (11 in total)\n\nDucati Desmosedici results\n(key) (results in bold indicate pole position; results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nNotes\n\n1 Being his final MotoGP race, Capirossi switched numbers for Valencia as a memorial to his fallen countryman Marco Simoncelli, killed at Sepang, by racing with No. 58 that Simoncelli used, instead of his normal No. 65.

The bikes are based on the same desmodromic valve arrangement of Ducati's flagship race-winning Superbike models, albeit with an all-new frame, aerodynamic bodywork and a designed weight of just 160kg. The Ducati Desmosedici was launched in 2003 and was the first MotoGP four-stroke production racer. It revolutionized the two-wheel class and was the benchmark for all the bikes that followed it. The Desmosedici is powered by a 998 cubic centimetre 90-degree liquid-cooled V4 engine that produces 209-213 horsepower depending on the MotoGP track and the tyre allocation in a given race. The engine is mated to a cassette type 6-speed transmission which is located at the rear of the bike and uses a slipper clutch to ensure positive engagement with the rear wheel. The Desmosedici uses a Pankl Racing Systems-developed lightweight titanium frame, \u00d6hlins suspension components, and weighs just 160kg. The Desmosedici proved to be a winning design and the bike gave Ducati their first MotoGP win in 2003 at the Dutch TT, ridden by Troy Bayliss. The Desmosedici also won the Manufacturer's Championship in 2007, in addition to individual riders' championships in both 2007 (Casey Stoner) and 2008 (Nicky Hayden). The Ducati Desmosedici was the first MotoGP bike to feature a four-stroke V4 engine. The bike was an instant success and has been an important factor in the success of Ducati in MotoGP. The bike was retired after the 2011 season as the technical regulations of MotoGP changed and four-stroke bikes were replaced by MotoGP bikes featuring inline-4 engines. Ducati have since built a special version of the Desmosedici for the Superbike World Championship. This special version was developed from the 2003-2011 version of the Desmosedici and features a modified frame, suspension, engine, valve timing and electronics. The Ducati Desmosedici is an iconic and legendary MotoGP bike that has been used by some of the greatest riders in the history of the sport. Its cutting-edge design, proven Championship-winning performance and enduring legacy have made it a bike that will be remembered in the history books for some time to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2456422}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Linda Ronstadt discography\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The discography of Linda Ronstadt, an American rock, pop and country artist (who also recorded in other genres, such as light opera and traditional Mexican music), consists of 24 solo studio albums, one live album, numerous compilation albums, and 63 singles. Widely recognized as the reigning \"Queen of Rock\", Ronstadt is estimated with 100 million record sales worldwide. According to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she has sold 30 million certified albums in the United States, making her the 9th best-selling female solo artist in the country. Billboard ranked her as the 67th Greatest artist of all time. \n\nAfter recording three albums with her folk rock band, The Stone Poneys, Ronstadt debuted on Capitol Records as a solo artist with 1969's Hand Sown ... Home Grown. Her final album was released in 2006. Between 1970 and 1973, Ronstadt released three studio albums: two on the Capitol label, Silk Purse (1970) and Linda Ronstadt (1971); and one on the Asylum label, Don't Cry Now (1973). Developing a country rock sound similar to that of the Eagles, Ronstadt recorded 1974's Grammy-winning Heart Like a Wheel, which sold over two million U. S. copies and spawned the #1 hits \"When Will I Be Loved\" and \"You're No Good\". Her next album was 1975's Prisoner in Disguise, which followed a similar musical style and contained a top five cover of \"Heat Wave\". Released in 1976, Hasten Down the Wind featured two Ronstadt-composed originals and established Ronstadt as the first ever female recording artist to release three million-selling albums. Its biggest hits were a cover of Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be The Day\" and a reworking of Willie Nelson's \"Crazy\". The album won Ronstadt her second Grammy Award. \n  \nHer 1977 release, Simple Dreams, followed a more rock-oriented format. It went triple platinum in the United States and produced two simultaneous top five hits: the platinum-certified \"Blue Bayou\" and \"It's So Easy\". Additional hits from the album included \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\", \"Tumbling Dice\", and the Top 10 country hit \"I Never Will Marry\". The following album, Living in the USA included a cover of Chuck Berry's \"Back in the U.S.A.\". It also contained a cover of the Motown classic \"Ooh Baby Baby\" which crossed over to R&B radio. In addition to the conventional Asylum release that is listed below, special limited-edition releases were also made of this album in red vinyl and picture disc. \"Just One Look\" was the album's third hit single.\n\nRonstadt's first disc of the 1980s was the New Wave-styled Mad Love. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard album chart and quickly became her seventh million-selling album in a row. It produced Top 10 singles with \"How Do I Make You\" and the scorching \"Hurt So Bad\".  \"Get Closer\", regarded as her final Rock album, followed in 1982.  Four music videos were filmed for this album, all were popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel.  On April 24, 1980, Ronstadt recorded a concert at Hollywood's Television Center Studios for HBO, to coincide with the release of Mad Love. 12 hand-picked performances by Ronstadt were later released in her only live album, Live in Hollywood on February 1, 2019. In 1983, Ronstadt changed musical directions towards big band jazz and traditional pop music, recording What's New, which was certified Triple Platinum in the United States. It was succeeded by 1984's Lush Life and 1986's For Sentimental Reasons (both Platinum-certified).\n\nTo celebrate her Mexican American heritage, Ronstadt recorded the Spanish-language album Canciones de Mi Padre in 1987, which sold more than two million copies in the U.S. and won Ronstadt another Grammy Award.  It stands as the best-selling non-English language record in U.S. music history. The same year, she also teamed with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton for the collaborative album Trio, which spawned four Top 10 country music hits, including the number 1 single, \"To Know Him Is To Love Him\". Her 1989 release, titled Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind, was Ronstadt's first pop music album in seven years. It produced two Grammy Award-winning duets with Aaron Neville on the Billboard Hot 100: the Gold-certified number 2 hit \"Don't Know Much\" and the number 11 hit \"All My Life\". Both songs were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits.\n\nAfter releasing two less successful Spanish-language albums in the early 1990s, Ronstadt returned to more contemporary music with 1993's New Age-styled Winter Light. It was followed by Feels Like Home, a return to country rock. Her Grammy-winning album of children's lullabies was issued in 1996 and had strong sales. Her 1998 release, We Ran, featured more rock-oriented album material. In 1999, Ronstadt reunited with Harris and Parton for Trio II, which won Ronstadt her eleventh competitive Grammy Award and nineteenth Gold album.

Both names translate literally to \"Japanese stringed instrument.\"\n\nAccording to Shint\u014d myth as written in the Kojiki, the yamatogoto played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first wagon or yamatogoto is born.\n\nThe instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known koto, the yamatogoto is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the yamatogoto's strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate.\n\nToday, the instrument is used only in the Shint\u014d ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.\n\nReferences\nClark, Mitchell (2005). \"Sounds of the Silk Road: Musical Instruments of Asia.\" Boston: Museum of Fine Arts Publications.\n\nJapanese musical instruments\nZithers\nKagura\nSacred musical instruments\nGagaku", "machine_text": " The Yamatogoto (\u5c71\u53d6) is a bowed string instrument from Japan dating back to around the 9th century CE. It is part of the classical tradition of Japanese instruments. The Yamatogoto is a 7-string instrument made of wood, with frets and a bridge similar to the Shamisen. It is often tuned in a major pentatonic tuning with perfect fourths between the strings. The Yamatogoto has a large resonator, resembling a half-moon shape on which the strings are strung. It is held between the legs when playing and the player plucks the strings with a bachi (plectrum). The Yamatogoto is used in a variety of musical contexts, from classical concerts to modern pop. It plays an important role in Japanese noh, a form of classical Japanese musical drama. Here, a Yamatogoto accompanies the actors and narrators as they perform their chants and songs. The instrument also plays a role in traditional and folk music, often accompanying chants, ceremonial music, and storytelling. It is also heard in gagaku, Japanese court music for ritualistic ceremonies. Gagaku is made up of ancient Asian traditions and modern Near Eastern influences, and the Yamatogoto is one of the instruments used to create this fusion of sound. Given its long history and associations with traditional culture, the Yamatogoto is sometimes used in accompaniment with shamisen and koto to depict an image of traditional Japan. In modern times it has been played by popular groups such as the Min'yo Connection, who give new life to traditional instrumentation. The Yamatogoto is a fascinating instrument, combining classical sounds with modern interpretations. Its use in a variety of musical styles and contexts makes it a fascinating instrument to explore and a vital component of the broader Japanese musical tradition.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2286630}

Colloquially known as \"Cap\", the club is one of the \"Big Four\" eating clubs at Princeton (the others are The Ivy Club, University Cottage Club, and Tiger Inn). Members are selected through a selective process called bicker. Sometimes known as \"the Illustrious Cap and Gown Club,\" it was the first of the currently selective eating clubs to accept women. Though personalities of eating clubs certainly change throughout the years, Cap and Gown is described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise as \"anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful.\"\n\nCap was the most bickered eating club in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. It has been the most selective club since 2013, with 287 students bickering in Spring 2019, thirty-five percent of whom were offered membership.\n\nHistory\nCap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to have stayed in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today.  A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, the Cap and Gown Club Board of Trustees unanimously approved a new financial aid policy that provides a grant to every member of Princeton University financial aid, guaranteeing that no member on full financial aid pays any out-of-pocket costs for club membership.\n\nNotable Cap and Gown alumni include Dean Cain '88, Brooke Shields '87, and Donald Rumsfeld '54.

The mosque overlooks the main street of Prizren and is a dominant feature in the town's skyline.\n\nSinan Pasha Mosque was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990 by the Republic of Serbia.\n\nHistory \n\nSofi Sinan Pasha started construction of the mosque in either 1600 or 1608. Sofi Sinan Pasha, an Albanian and former beylerbey and kaymakam in Bosnia should not be confused with grand vizier Sinan Pasha, who built the Sinan Pasha Mosque in the nearby city of Ka\u010danik.\n\nIt is widely considered that the stones used to build the mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery founded by Serbian Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an. In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the mosque. The monastery, which was abandoned after the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, had fallen to ruins by the 17th century. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in 1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan.\n\nDescription \n\nThe mosque covers roughly  by  and is square in shape. It has one large dome and another smaller half-dome that covers the mihrab, which is painted and has a stalactite hood. The mosque's walls are  thick and its minaret, which is topped by a conical structure covered by lead, is  in height.\n\nThe walls and dome inside Sinan Pasha Mosque were painted in the 19th century, mostly of floral patterns and Qur'an verses. The minbar is painted with floral motives. Both the large dome and the half-dome of the mosque are covered with lead. The stone flooring of the mosque and the carpentry are original.\n\nPreservation concerns \nRain, which over time has entered the mosque via holes in the roof, has caused the loss of some original paintings on the walls and has led to the detachment of some of the wall plaster. Stones of the fa\u00e7ade have faced weathering.\n\nAbdullah G\u00ebrguri worked on a series of repairs of the murals, particularly in the 1970s.\n\nIn early 2000 the cost to rehabilitate the building was estimated at about \u20ac500,000 by UNESCO.\n\nManuscripts and use of building controversy \nThe Prizren municipality intended to build a library within the mosque in order to preserve not only the original Ottoman manuscripts found in the mosque, but also other valuable ones that can be found all over Kosovo. However, the Islamic Union of Kosovo filed a lawsuit against the Prizren Municipality in order to not allow the mosque to become a museum, but instead to have it continue to be a religious building.\n\nSee also \nList of mosques in Kosovo\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\nMosques in Prizren\nOttoman mosques in Kosovo\nReligious buildings and structures completed in 1615\n1615 establishments in the Ottoman Empire\n17th-century mosques\nCultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)\nMonuments and memorials in Kosovo", "machine_text": " The Sinan Pasha Mosque (also known as the \u0106arshija Mosque) is an Ottoman mosque located in the city of Prizren, Kosovo.

The mosque is named after Sinan Pasha, the 5th Ottoman governor of Kosovo, who ordered its construction in 1615. The mosque was built entirely out of stone, with a rectangular structure measuring 37 m by 25 m, and two tall minarets. The main prayer hall is covered by a large dome, and flanked by two half-domes with barrel vaults. Inside the prayer hall, the walls and the domes are decorated with frescoes painted in the traditional Islamic style, as well as with geometric and floral motifs in blue and gold. Additionally, the facade of the mosque is decorated with calligraphic inscriptions which call for prayer, while the interior walls contain inscriptions describing the life of Sinan Pasha and his achievements. The mosque is located in the Prizren old town, in the bazaar \u0106arshija, where Sinan Pasha built his own mansion and his own fountain. The bazaar and the fountain are still in place and regularly visited by tourists. The mosque also contains the mausoleum of Sinan Pasha and his family. The Sinan Pasha Mosque was, and still is, of great importance as a reflection of traditional Islamic life in the Balkans.

The cabinet was a centre-right coalition and had a substantial majority in the House of Representatives with prominent Catholic politician Victor Marijnen the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in the previous cabinet serving as Prime Minister. Protestant Leader Barend Biesheuvel served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and was given the portfolio of Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs.\n\nThe cabinet served in the middle of the tumultuous 1960s, domestically it had to deal with the counterculture and economic changes following the discovery of the Groningen gas field and it had to deal with the fallout of the marriage between Princess Irene and carlist Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma and it was able to implement several major social reforms to health insurance and the public broadcasting system, internationally the disbandment of the Netherlands New Guinea was finalized. The cabinet suffered several major internal conflicts, and fell just 19 months into its term on 27 February 1965 following a conflict over the implantation of Commercial Broadcasting and continued in a demissionary capacity until it was replaced with the Cals cabinet.\n\nTerm\nThe natural gas reserves, recently found in Slochteren were a considerable boost for the economy. This, combined with labour shortage led to a rise in wages and the attraction of foreign workers. Despite this being the second cabinet without socialist Labour Party, the building up of a welfare state, that was started after World War II, continued with the introduction of minimum wages in 1964 and the national health service.\n\nIn 1965, measures were taken against commercial television stations transmitting from the North Sea.

It was a majority left-wing coalition, which consisted of the Catholic People's Party (KVP), the Labour Party (PvdA), the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Political Reformed Party (SGP). This cabinet was a very short-lived one and was considered one of the weakest Dutch cabinets ever. It was only in office for less than 2 years. The first Marijnen cabinet was formed by Prime Minister Jan Marijnen, who was appointed by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands on 24 July 1963. It was a coalition of the three main Christian parties (KVP, ARP and SGP) and theLabour Party (PvdA). This cabinet was mainly focused on implementing the decentralized governmental structures. This process of decentralisation had already been initiated but was not yet complete. One of the foremost priorities of the Marijnen cabinet was to continue the process of decentralisation. The Marijnen cabinet didn't manage to make much progress in developing policies or implementing reforms. During his term as prime minister, Jan Marijnen was frequently absent from cabinet meetings and did not always take part in the debates. This caused it to be called the \"sleeping cabinet\" due to its lack of action. During its term, the cabinet implemented the first income tax reform since 1919, as well as the dismantling of the agricultural monopoly. It also created the Advisory Council on Science and Technology, which was established to support technological development in the Netherlands. Despite some successful reforms, the Marijnen cabinet was mostly known for its lack of action and its weak leadership. Its decision-making often lacked clarity and direction, which made it difficult for it to enact policies or implement reforms. This resulted in a lack of support and trust from opposition parties. On 14 April 1965, the cabinet resigned due to a crisis in the KVP. Prime Minister Jan Marijnen had not included the KVP in the talks on the formation of the new cabinet, and this caused a crisis in the party. As a result, the cabinet resigned in order to resolve the crisis and provide a new government. The new coalition was then formed by the KVP, PvdA, ARP and the People's Movement. The Marijnen cabinet is widely seen as one of the weakest cabinets in the Dutch history. The lack of clear leadership and the reclining state of the government, as well as the cabinet's short duration, have obscured its legacy. It is remembered for its lack of action and achievements, and as one of the weakest cabinets in the Dutch political history.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8347039}

It is an updated form of the Qing magua, itself a more fashionable adaptation of the riding jacket once worn by Manchu horsemen.\n\nName\nT\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the clothes' Chinese name, written as  in traditional characters and as  in the simplified characters now used in mainland China. Its spelling may vary a little in other romanizations or dialects. It is also sometimes translated as a  or jacket.\n\nAlthough the name of the jacket in English and Chinese suggests an origin during (or at least reference to) the Tang period of Chinese history, it was actually intended by its designers to mean a \"Chinese\" outfit. In fact, \u201cTangzhuang\u201d is basically the Chinese style of dress in the late Qing Dynasty. The origin of the term \u201cTangzhuang\u201d also has a taste of \u201cexport to domestic sales\u201d. Foreigners call \u201cChina town\u201d as \u201cTang People Street\u201d, and naturally call Chinese clothing \u201cTangzhuang\u201d. In southern China and among the Chinese diaspora, dialects like Cantonese refer to ethnic Chinese\u2014as opposed to all Chinese nationals\u2014as \"Tang people\" rather than \"Han\". It is thus also sometimes translated as a  After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call the garment the \"new tangzhuang\" or  but neither name lasted. Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of traditional Chinese clothing.\n\nHistory\n\nMagua\n\nThe tangzhuang is an adaption of the Manchu \"horse jacket\" (magua), a waist- or three-quarter-length front-opening jacket or surcoat. This was initially worn\u2014usually in a dark blue color\u2014by Manchu horsemen, but became mandatory for Han officials' clothing under the Qing Empire. Over time, it evolved from a protective apron for the changshan into an item of Chinese fashion in its own right and even a mark of imperial favor. Its use then spread among the common Han, including among the Chinese diaspora abroad. \n\nFollowing the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the \"Mao suit\" (Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n zhu\u0101ng) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts. After the fall of the Gang of Four in the late 1970s and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s, traditional clothing began to experience a revival in mainland China. Variants of the magua became noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s.\n\n2001 APEC Summit\n\nIn 1993, US president Bill Clinton tried to bring trade talks back on track by inviting the heads of the APEC member economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented each with a leather bomber jacket bearing the APEC logo as a memento. The next year, Indonesia followed suit and presented batik shirts; the world leaders then humored Suharto's request that they wear them for a group photo. The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present traditional and representative clothes from their cultures, and the leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of solidarity.\n\nAhead of the first occasion of China's hosting the summit in 2001, state-run media acquainted the Chinese with the custom, prompting speculation as to what China's \"traditional clothes\" might be: Mao suits had been displaced by western-style suits; minority groups often had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of Han clothing (h\u00e0nf\u00fa) had varied from dynasty to dynasty, with the most recent Qing forms heavily influenced by the Manchus and their oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40 presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year, their foreign origin or political connotations led officials to select an \"ambiguously traditional\" design by Shanghainese clothiers Li Jianqin (, L\u01d0 Ji\u00e0nq\u00edn) and Yu Ying (t s Y\u00fa Y\u012bng) and by five others at Qinyi (t s Q\u00edny\u00ec F\u00fash\u00ec) and the Shanghai Garment Group (t s Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei F\u00fazhu\u0101ng J\u00edtu\u00e1n). \n\nThe jackets given to the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made from silk supposedly artificially enhanced to be stronger, softer, more wrinkle-resistant, more water-absorbent, and better ventilated, with longer-lasting and brighter colors. They featured cotton knotwork instead of buttons and a design of peonies surrounding the letters \"APEC\". The jackets were handmade but not personally sized; instead, they were fitted using stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available in case those measurements were mistaken. The leaders had a choice among scarlet, azure, green, brown, maroon, and black versions; each came in a matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an off-white silk shirt to wear beneath it. The 20 attendees\u2014the leaders of all the APEC member economies except \"Chinese Taipei\"\u2014mostly opted for the red-and-black or blue-and-gold design and wore the jackets to their meetings at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum on 21 October 2001 and for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" afterwards that closed the event.\n\nTangzhuang craze\nThe tangzhuang's use as the representative unisex Chinese clothing for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" immediately led to its more widespread popularity, spreading from Beijing to other large towns around the country as far afield as Lanzhou in Gansu by the next Chinese New Year. This \"tangzhuang craze\" (t s t\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng r\u00e8) saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become fashionable daily wear for both sexes, which gave a large boost to the domestic silk industry. The original designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to capitalize on their creation's popularity, but the fad was short-lived and most had moved on by 2004.\n\nSubsequent history\n\nEven after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place in Chinese fashion. It remained in common use among Jiang Zemin's clique and the nouveau riche, but more especially became a menswear staple on the mainland and abroad for traditional Chinese holidays alongside western and Mao-style suits.\n\nThe tangzhuang\u2014and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing\u2014is also credited by members of the hanfu movement with having inspired their cause and a revival of actual traditional Han clothing, despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin. (Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with Japanese kimonos and Ming clothes with Korean hanboks.)\n\nChina used the \"Tang suit jackets\" again for its 2014 APEC summit, but with an updated style in maroon, green, and blue that The Guardian unflatteringly compared to Star Trek uniforms.\n\nStyle\n\nThe APEC jackets were intended to reflect \"both traditional Chinese flavor and modern ideals\". They have straight Mandarin collars, similar to those on the changshan and magua that gave the style its name. Unlike the traditional 2D \"flat-cutting\"  p\u00edngmi\u00e0n c\u00e1iji\u01cen) process used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D \"solid-cutting\" (t s l\u00ect\u01d0 c\u00e1iji\u01cen) process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ draping, darts, and set-in sleeves cut separately from the rest of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional Chinese designs. The original version also employed shoulder pads to give a stronger silhouette.\n\nAlthough the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial fibers, silk tangzhuang have since outsold those made from cotton and other materials. Tangzhuang are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red or blue. The brocade is often decorated with a repeated pattern of embroidery. Common designs involve the repetition of auspicious Chinese characters such as f\u00fa (, \"happiness\") or sh\u00f2u (t, s, \"longevity\") for good luck and good wishes. Tangzhuang are usually fastened with decorative knotwork instead of buttons.\n\nTangzhuang are usually considered menswear but they may also be worn by women, as by New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark at APEC 2001.\n\nSee also \n Chinese clothing\n Hanfu, also meaning \"Han clothing\"\n Ru - Chinese upper garment\n Chinese button knot\n Color in Chinese culture\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n\nChinese clothing\nJackets\n21st-century fashion", "machine_text": " Tangzhuang (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u88c5; traditional Chinese: \u7cd6\u88dd; pinyin: t\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng) is a style of traditional Chinese dress originating from the late Qing dynasty, during the rule of the Guangxu Emperor. It is considered to be an iconic example of Chinese folk clothing, and it remains popular today, often worn at special events or celebratory occasions. The Tangzhuang style is characterized by its bright colors, intricate embroidery, and contrasting palettes. It usually consists of wide-legged, wide-waisted trousers, and a long, coat-like tunic that is usually made from cotton or silk fabrics. The most recognizable feature of tangzhuang is its collar style, which is often styled in a butterfly shape with contrast color embroidery. Many styles also have decorative elements such as frogs (Chinese buttons) and squares up and down the front. Tangzhuang originated from the Manchu people of Northeast China in the late 19th century and was popularized by Empress Dowager Cixi in the early 20th century. The tunic was originally the Han Chinese k\u00ea-tone, and was introduced to the Manchu court by Empress Dowager Cixi. She believed that the k\u00ea-tone style was too casual to be suitable for royalty, and so she modified it to make a more formal garment fitting for court. She made the front of the tunic flatter, and added the wide-waisted trousers, giving it the distinctive Manchu look. The bright colors of tangzhuang are more closely associated with the wearing of traditional Chinese clothing for special occasions such as weddings, New Year's celebrations, or other festive events. The colors symbolize good luck and fortune, and some colors are even said to ward off evil spirits. For example, red is associated with strength and good luck, while yellow is associated with courage and victory. Today, tangzhuang can be seen worn by many people in modern Chinese culture. It is a fashionable trend for both men and women, with more modern styles adopting the traditional patterns and colors for a more modern feel. It is also popular for brides to wear tangzhuang on their wedding day, as a sign of respect and as a way to show off their traditional Chinese heritage. Tangzhuang is an iconic example of Chinese folk clothing, and it has been adopted into modern fashion in both China and other parts of the world. It is considered a fashionable way to show respect for Chinese culture, and it is often worn at special events or celebratory occasions. As modern fashion trends continue to evolve, it is likely that tangzhuang will remain a favorite among Chinese people, and will continue to be popular in both modern and traditional circles.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10983937}

Released in 1992, the album contains four pieces, each scored for a unique ensemble of instruments. The ensemble is stocked with virtuosic soloists playing unfamiliar instruments, including oboe, English horn, string quartet, and marimba. Beaser's interest in a variety of folk and classical traditions is reflected in his writing, particularly in his use of polytonality, polyphonic structures, and passages mixing elements of modal and atonal tonalities. Each of the four pieces features some kind of soloist, and their interaction with the larger ensemble provides a unifying element. The first piece, \"Lament of the Pines,\" is a two-movement piece scored for a combination of strings, oboe, and English horn. The opening section is an expression of mourning; the oboe's sorrowful solo is complemented by the strings' somber chords. In the second movement, the second voice, a chorale sung by the strings, emerges with a cheerful and lively tone, lightening the sentiment of the first. The second work, \"Garden Music,\" is written for four marimbas in a large and complex texture. The marimbas move together in a similar way as a chamber orchestra, opening and closing movements in unison. This piece is characterized by its lively rhythm, virtuosic polyphonic writing, and its varied dynamic coloring. The third piece, \"Arioso for Oboe and Strings,\" utilizes the solo oboe and string quartet to build a bright, lyrical piece. The solo line of the oboe is complemented by the string quartet interweaving harmonic and consonant material into the texture. The fourth, and final, piece, \"Farewell to Ireland,\" is a simple and tune-like piece. Composed as a traditional Irish folk melody, the piece is arranged in a more classical texture, utilizing the oboe as a soloist. Featuring some of the finest contemporary composers, 4 (Ensemble) Compositions 1992 displays virtuosic writing with a variety of instrumentations, styles, and colors. By embracing a range of folk, chamber, and classical traditions, Beaser creates a unique and captivating album.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31928127}

The lyrics refer to heaven as a \"place where nothing ever happens\", and describe a bar, a party, and a kiss.  The song has been called \"the calm after their unusual ominous storm\" by AllMusic as well as something \"psychologists would certainly have a field day with\" by author and The Guardian journalist Ian Gittins.\n\nDave Bell, writing for quarterly UK magazine Ceasefire, argued that the song \"epitomises pop as Samuel Beckett might write it: tedious, beautiful and desperate\".\n\nCover versions \nIn 1996 the song was covered by Jimmy Scott who also made it the title track of his album, Heaven.\n\nThe song was covered by Eric Burdon on his 2004 album My Secret Life and in 1985 by Simply Red for their album Picture Book.\n\nIn 1980, a german cover named \"Der Weg in die Ferne\" was recorded by Joachim Witt for his album Silberblick.\n\nReferences\n\n1979 songs\nTalking Heads songs\nEric Burdon songs\nSimply Red songs\nSongs written by David Byrne\nSong recordings produced by David Byrne\nSong recordings produced by Brian Eno\nSongs written by Jerry Harrison\nSongs written by Chris Frantz\nSongs written by Tina Weymouth\nSong recordings produced by Jerry Harrison\nSongs about Heaven", "machine_text": " Heaven is a song by American post-punk band Talking Heads, released as a single in 1982. It later appeared on the band's fourth studio album, Speaking in Tongues, which was released later that year. Heaven was written by lead singer David Byrne and produced by Talking Heads with Brian Eno. Heaven is a midtempo funk-fusion song with sparse instrumentation. The song's anthemic chorus features Byrne singing with a multi-tracked vocal choir. The lyrics describe Byrne's view of a possible heavenly afterlife, and express ambivalence about it. The chorus also includes variations on the phrase \"Heaven, is a place where nothing ever happens\". They were intended to suggest both the beauty and dullness of a peaceful, non-existence in the afterlife. The song's jazzy guitar is by Adrian Belew, and the bass by Tina Weymouth. The single featured the album version on one side and the \"Nightclub Version\" on the other, which was extended and had additional production by John Potoker. In concert, the song included intro and outro sections with improvisations by Belew featuring a fusion of jazz and funk guitar. Heaven was generally well received by critics. Penny Valentine of Smash Hits called it \"a conversationally droll slice of avant-garde pop that drills to the spiritual heart of life\", while other reviews likened it to earlier Talking Heads songs like \"Once in a Lifetime\". It fared well commercially in the United States, topping the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart and becoming a moderate hit on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, however, it only reached number 99 on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was filmed featuring the band walking around in an abandoned building. Heaven is seen as a classic Talking Heads song, along with songs like \"Psycho Killer\" and \"Burning Down the House\". It has also been featured prominently in cult films like Stranger Than Paradise and True Stories, as well as in a 2020 episode of the popular Netflix series Stranger Things.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13120897}

This concept has been explored extensively in literature, films, television, video games, and other forms of media. The vision of future worlds typically centers on technological and socio-economic advances that have drastically changed the way people live, work, and play. Whether depicting a utopian paradise of advancement or a dystopian wasteland of destruction, all versions of the future promise a glimpse into the potential that lies in store for humanity. If not for the constant refinement and evolution of technology, many of the imagined futures presented in books, movies, and video games would not be possible. Examples of future worlds presented in media are plentiful. In literature, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or George Orwell's 1984 explore the potential of societies vastly different from our own. In film, Joss Whedon's Serenity, Christopher Nolan's Inception, and James Cameron\u2019s Avatar offer fascinating visions of the future. Television series such as Star Trek, Babylon 5, and Battlestar Galactica are also noteworthy in this regard. Video games are perhaps the medium most closely associated with the concept of future worlds. Examples such as Bioshock, Half-Life 2, and Mass Effect all feature visually stunning environments where the player experiences life outside of our reality. In each of these, the player is tasked with wandering through unknown and highly advanced environments full of unique challenges. Future worlds in media are often used to explore the potential consequences of humanity\u2019s behavior over time. By leaving familiar surroundings and entering a world not yet realized, readers, viewers, and players can see firsthand the potential options available to society and its future inhabitants. In this way, future worlds can be seen as a kind of warning against the dangers of unchecked progress and ambition. Although always highly speculative, future worlds have become an integral part of the human experience in the modern age. By immersing oneself in an unknown reality that promises to be greater than anything which has come before, we can gain a glimpse of how our current actions and decisions may shape the future of our species.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46274436}

Born in Fukuoka prefecture, Teshima began his career as a cartoonist at an early age, becoming an influential figure in the development of post-war avant-garde art. He is best known for his experimental films, which showcased the unique framework of his narrative style and were often created in collaboration with other filmmakers. The hallmark of these films was their unpredictable and ambiguous storyline, which made them stand out among his contemporaries. In the 1950s, he created the first self-made abstract film, which featured hand-colored animation made from water-based paints, painted directly onto film. He also experimented with the use of a primitive form of Special Effects, utilizing long, continuous film strips and stop-motion techniques. He also blended these techniques with his own rotoscoping techniques, creating some of the most visually striking animation of the era. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Teshima continued to explore the realm of experimental and avant-garde film making, creating works that explored themes of spirituality, surrealism, and art. He became especially adept at creating experimental music videos, and directed many for bands and singers, such as the Beatles and Pink Floyd. His work in this genre earned him international recognition, and in 1974 he was the recipient of the Grand Prix at the Venice International Film Festival. In the following years, he continued to expand his repertoire and explore the outer edges of video art, craftsmanship, and animation. His influence was but only beginning to be seen at the time of his death in 1989, and his legacy has been celebrated ever since. Shiro Teshima is remembered as one of the most influential and innovative minds in the history of experimental animation, whose work has had a lasting impact upon the video art movement.

In her lectures, Chiao Chiao stressed on the combination of modern architecture and Chinese culture, clearly departing from the traditionalism of the Imperial architecture in her own country. She favored the ideas of Rationalism and Modernism, including the notion of 'comprehensive form' and 'vertical integration', essential components of the avant-garde movement. Through her writing, Chiao Chiao also addressed the issue of harmonizing urban development with its natural environment, as well as exploring the ways of conducting low-cost housing. In 1996, Chiao Chiao moved to the United States and established the Chiao Chiao Institute in Virginia, to promote Chinese architectural development. In her research, Chiao Chiao also studied how globalisation influences traditional urban-regional planning and architecture in China, externalising the influences of a developing capitalist economy. In 2004, Chiao Chiao put forward the \u2018Water Drop\u2019 approach, emphasizing the importance of retaining an organic relationship between urban and rural areas, incorporating 'software and hardware resources of rural space'. She argued that new rural space should be designed taking into consideration the traditional customs of rural area, and that modern city should not be a copy of Western urban model, but instead integrating both Chinese and Western elements. Chiao Chiao\u2019s thought and theory have inspired many Chinese young architects and urban planners to bring Chinese traditional culture into the modern design and development of the city. Currently, Chiao Chiao is a frequent traveller, giving lectures and conferences all over the world. Her work and thought provides an important insight into the intricate relationship between Chinese culture and modern architecture, highly impacting Chinese post-modernist architecture.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14217738}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Snyder, New York\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Snyder (originally Snyderville) is a hamlet within the town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, United States that is part of the Buffalo \u2013 Niagara Falls metropolitan area.  The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo and points to the east in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nAs of 2009, the hamlet had several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions.  The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college.  The Snyder community has above-average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region.  The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet.\n\nThe traditional definition of the hamlet is the \"Snyder\" postal service area, now merged into the 14226 zip code.  However, using United States Census Bureau-based data, which does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the modern definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snyderville  and subsequently Snyder.  Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County.  As newlyweds, they moved to a log cabin on a farm on the 4301 Main Street location of Amherst Central High School.  The Schenck family moved to Amherst at the corner of Main Street and Harlem Road in 1821. Abraham Snyder arrived from Pennsylvania in 1823 and moved to a spacious frame house in the late 1830s. His son Michael rose to prominence. John Schenck, Michael Snyder's cousin, built the hamlet's first house and later built the first store in 1837, which was the year the hamlet was first established.\n\nIn 1830, a stagecoach was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and Batavia, and sometimes Albany, and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street. By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory. Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the stagecoach line along Main Street.  In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the Amherst Bee, which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper. L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883.\n\nIn 1892, an electric trolley, which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 62, into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's streetcar system.  This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the \"country\".  This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs. In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street/Harlem Road area, including blacksmith shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain. In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live closer to each other in new subdivisions.\n\nGeography\n\nSnyder is located in the southern part of Amherst, which is located in Erie County.  As a hamlet it has no formal boundaries, but was originally defined by the area served by its post office.  The traditional boundaries of the hamlet are Getzville and\nBrantwood Road on the west, Sheridan Drive, also known as New York State Route 324, on the north, I-290, known as the Youngmann Expressway/I-90, known as New York State Thruway on the east, and the Cheektowaga town line along Wehrle Drive east of Harlem Road and then Winspear Avenue on the south.\n\nWhen defining the Snyder community market area using census data, the western boundary extends a little further to include parts of the hamlet of Eggertsville, which was built around the Main Street and Eggert Road intersection, with a western boundary from north to south of Millersport Highway, also known as New York State Route 263, Longmeadow Road, Westfield Road, Main Street, LeBrun Road, and Eggert Road.  When defined this way, Snyder includes (using a Main Street and Harlem Road origin, starting with the northwest quadrant, and moving clockwise) census block groups 1\u20133 from census tract 94.01; census block groups 3 & 4 from census tract 94.02; census block groups 3\u20135 from census tract 95.02; and census block groups 1, 3\u20135 from census tract 95.01.  The center of town at Main Street and Harlem is at an elevation of .\n\nThe business district is located between Burroughs Drive to the east and Campus Drive to the west on Main Street.  In this region, the Snyder Fire Department, the Eggertsville-Snyder Branch of the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library (4622 Main Street), the Amherst YMCA (4433 Main Street), and the Main Harlem Plaza as well as the former location of the United States Postal Service office for the 14226 zip code that includes Snyder and the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville are located.  The post office for the zip code was formerly located at Main Street and Chateau Terrace with a 25 Chateau Terrace address until May 1, 1990.\n\nHarlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts.  Sheridan Harlem Plaza and adjacent commercial property are located at the north end of Harlem. Both Kensington Avenue and Wehrle Drive intersect the southern part of the Snyder portion of Harlem in a commercial region that extends into Cheektowaga.  The Harlem\u2013Kensington commercial district is historic.  The fourth commercial district is located in the eastern edge of the hamlet at the intersection of Main Street and Kensington Avenue near the entrance to the Youngmann Expressway. The extended Snyder community has additional commercial areas along the highly commercial Sheridan Drive and on Millersport Highway.\n\nTransportation\nSnyder is bounded by I-290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this interstate highway that are both less than a  from the Main and Harlem center of town.  This provides direct access to the I-90 (The New York State Thruway) and continuing south on Harlem to the New York State Route 33 a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I-90.  The community is also serviced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which provides three different bus routes (30, 48, and 49) connecting directly to the light rail Buffalo Metro Rail along Main Street to the west.  All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to Erie Community College (north campus), the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Transit Road (New York State Route 78).  The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations.\n\nHistorically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street.  In 1836, the street became a Macadam toll road.  On  April 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsville  to the east.  It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings: Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive and Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard.  The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918.  Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005.  These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area.\n\nWillard Genrich built the Lord Amherst Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I-290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses.\n\nEconomy\n\nSnyder is an affluent and well-educated community in Metropolitan Buffalo.  The residential population consists mostly of large single family homes on individual lots.  The 2000 United States Census average household income of $87,700 ($ today) far exceeds the Buffalo regional average of $57,400 ($).  The Snyder population declined from 14,294 to 13,875 while the number of households increased from 5,469 to 5,574 between the 1990 United States Census and the 2000 United States Census.  During the decade the number of children age 5\u201317 and adults age 35\u201354 grew significantly while the young adults age 18\u201334 and adults over the age of 55 declined sharply.  The number of housing units grew from 5,662 to 5,739. 1990 housing was 82.5% single-family housing.  The busiest ATM in the entire Buffalo region is in Snyder.\n\nThe traditionally defined Snyder portion of Main Street had 180 businesses as of January 2002. The town has two theatres: MusicalFare Theatre, a not for profit corporation on the Daemen College campus, and ComedySportz Buffalo.\n\nStarting in the 1950s zoning laws required that all new buildings be set back from the street and have private on-site parking.  The 21st Century zoning laws date back to 1976.\n\nGovernment\nThere is no formal Snyder government.  The hamlet, like the rest of the town of Amherst, is served by the Town of Amherst Government and receives municipal services from the town.  It is serviced by entities such as the Amherst Police Department, Snyder fire department and the Town of Amherst Highway Department, although Main Street and Harlem Road are serviced by the New York State Department of Transportation.  Residents of Amherst, including those in Snyder, pay taxes both to the Town of Amherst and the County of Erie.  However, the town tax is solely a school tax and the county collects the remaining town taxes for municipal services.\n\nEducation\n\nAmherst Central High School, the town's public high school, is located at 4301 Main Street, just west of the business district.  The school started when the new Amherst school district was created in the late 1920s.  Previously students from Eggertsville and Snyder either attended Bennett High School at 2885 Main Street in Buffalo or what is now called Williamsville South High School at 5950 Main Street in Williamsville and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Williamsville Junior and Senior High School.\n\nDaemen College is located across from the high school at 4380 Main Street.  Amherst Middle School (formerly Amherst Junior High School), the town's public middle school, is located two blocks south of the High School at 55 Kings Highway.  Additionally, the Stenograhic Institute-Western New York at 4525 Main Street, which offers undergraduate degrees, is found in the business district.\n\nOther schools located in the district include Smallwood Drive Elementary School (K-5), Park School of Buffalo (Pre-K-12), and Christ The King School (Pre-K-8). Park has been located in Snyder since 1922.  Smallwood is public; Park is private and Christ The King is a Roman Catholic school.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSnyder Homepage\nAmherst homepage\nEggertsville-Snyder branch of the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library\n\n1837 establishments in New York (state)\nPopulated places established in 1837\nBuffalo\u2013Niagara Falls metropolitan area\nHamlets in New York (state)\nHamlets in Erie County, New York", "machine_text": " Snyder, New York is a hamlet located in the town of Cheektowaga, in Erie County, New York.

The hamlet was named after early settler James Snyder, who was a prominent figure in the early development of the town. He bought a large parcel of land and began to develop it into farmland. He later sold the land to local farmers who began to build homes, stores, schools, and also established a post office in the early 1900s. The hamlet has several small businesses, including restaurants and auto repair shops, as well as a small post office. The area is also home to a number of churches, including the Our Lady of Czestochowa and St. Andrew Lutheran churches. Snyder is located just a few minutes away from Buffalo Municipal Airport, making it easily accessible to travelers. It is also close to the village of Williamsville and the cities of Amherst and Tonawanda. Besides the businesses and churches, Snyder also has recreational opportunities. The nearby Ellicott Creek is a popular spot for fishing and canoeing in the summer months while Ellicott Creek Park offers swimming, basketball, and tennis courts. The area also has a number of golf courses and numerous hiking and biking trails. Snyder is home to a number of historical sites, including the Snyder-Trenchard House, a Victorian-style home built in the late 19th century. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is now open to the public for tours.

It was founded in 1792 by Thomas Biddulph and John Fenton, who wanted to secure the future of the British monarchy. They were the forerunners of the Tory Party. The Confederacy was built upon two main concepts: a belief in the superiority of the British government, and an opposition to the Radical movement that had arisen in the wake of the French Revolution. The group sought to preserve the established order, including the House of Commons, the Houses of Lords and the common law. To this end, the Confederacy sought to forestall any further political change by using its influence in Parliament to prevent the passing of radical reforms and to oppose what it perceived as a weakening of national security. The Confederation also supported a number of established practices, including the continuation of hereditary privilege, the subordination of colonial territories, and the maintenance of an hierarchical social structure. The Confederacy was not a political party; it was an informal network of political operators, united only by their shared adherence to conservative ideals. Its members were mostly Conservative politicians, but also included many Dissenters and members of the aristocracy. Members of the group enjoyed considerable influence and power in the post-revolutionary era, and their views often had an impact on the development of British politics, economics, and social policy. The influence of the Confederacy began to wane in the early 19th century, as reformist movements gained momentum and the Tory Party became the dominant force in British politics. The dissolution of the Confederacy in 1802 signaled the end of its era of political significance. Nevertheless, its conservative legacy was felt for many decades, serving to define a distinctively conservative position in British politics and to shape the reactions of many prominent Tories to the ideas of the 19th and early 20th centuries.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41570151}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Auguste Rodin\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Ren\u00e9 Rodin (12 November 184017 November 1917) was a French sculptor generally considered the founder of modern sculpture. He was schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work. Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, and deeply pocketed surface in clay. He is known for such sculptures as The Thinker, Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell.\n\nMany of Rodin's most notable sculptures were criticized, as they clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modeled the human body with naturalism, and his sculptures celebrate individual character and physicality. Although Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, he refused to change his style, and his continued output brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.\n\nFrom the unexpected naturalism of Rodin's first major figure \u2013 inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy \u2013 to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, his reputation grew, and Rodin became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His student, Camille Claudel, became his associate, lover, and creative rival. Rodin's other students included Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, and Charles Despiau. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.\n\nBiography\n\nFormative years\nRodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age 10. Between ages 14 and 17, he attended the Petite \u00c9cole, a school specializing in art and mathematics where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections, and Rodin expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite \u00c9cole that he met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.\n\nIn 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Entrance requirements were not particularly high at the Grande \u00c9cole, so the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. He left the Petite \u00c9cole in 1857 and earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.\n\nRodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of peritonitis in a convent in 1862, and Rodin was anguished with guilt because he had introduced her to an unfaithful suitor. He turned away from art and joined the Catholic order of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and sensed his lack of suitability for the order, so he encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. Rodin returned to work as a decorator while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail and his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion significantly influenced Rodin.\n\nIn 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he stayed for the rest of his life, with varying commitment. The couple had a son named Auguste-Eug\u00e8ne Beuret (1866\u20131934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the French National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family, as poverty was a continual difficulty for him until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked him to join him in Belgium, where they worked on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.\n\nRodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop since he could not afford castings. His relationship with Carrier-Belleuse had deteriorated, but he found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of Donatello and Michelangelo. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction. Rodin said, \"It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture.\" Returning to Belgium, he began work on The Age of Bronze, a life-size male figure whose naturalism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheatingits naturalism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.\n\nArtistic independence\n\nRose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. Charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.\n\nRodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural pieces in the style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.\n\nIn 1880, Carrier-Belleuse\u00a0\u2013 then art director of the S\u00e8vres national porcelain factory\u00a0\u2013 offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.\n\nThe artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer L\u00e9on Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.\n\nRodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.\n\nIn 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor Alfred Boucher in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions as well as creating her own works. Her Bust of Rodin was displayed to critical acclaim at the 1892 Salon.\n\nAlthough busy with The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.\n\nIn 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's \"double life\". Claudel and Rodin shared an atelier at a small old castle (the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Islette in the Loire), but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, \"I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.\"\n\nClaudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and brother that she was sane.\n\nWorks\n\nIn 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken Nose, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighborhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece was not a traditional bust, but instead the head was \"broken off\" at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the \"unfinishedness\" that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.\n\nEarly figures: the inspiration of Italy\nIn Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.\n\nIn 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics\u00a0\u2013 commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event\u00a0\u2013 and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work The Vanquished, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on The Age of Bronze, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin's words, \"man arising from nature\". Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind \"just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject\".\n\nIts mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so naturalistic that Rodin was accused of surmoulage\u00a0\u2013 having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to \"a statue of a sleepwalker\" and called it \"an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type\". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs\u00a0\u2013 what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.\n\nA second male nude, St. John the Baptist Preaching, was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of surmoulage by making the statue larger than life: St. John stands almost . While The Age of Bronze is statically posed, St. John gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground\u00a0\u2013 a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, \"display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively\".\n\nDespite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.\n\nRegardless of the immediate receptions of St. John and The Age of Bronze, Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of surmoulage. The artistic community knew his name.\n\nThe Gates of Hell\n\nA commission to create a portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.\n\nHe conceived The Gates with the surmoulage controversy still in mind: \"...I had made the St. John to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined...to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life.\" Laws of composition gave way to the Gates''' disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin's meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.The Gates of Hell comprised 186 figures in its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and The Prodigal Son.The Thinker (originally titled The Poet, after Dante) was to become one of the best-known sculptures in the world. The original was a  high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the Gates' lintel, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While The Thinker most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical Adam, the mythological Prometheus, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of The Thinker, stressing the figure's rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.\n\nThe Burghers of Calais\n\nThe town of Calais had contemplated a historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the army of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.\n\nRodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart. Though the town envisioned an allegorical, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.\n\nIn 1889, The Burghers of Calais was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing , and its figures are  tall. The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could \"penetrate to the heart of the subject\". At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.\n\nThe committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.\n\nCommissions and controversy \n\nCommissioned to create a monument to French writer Victor Hugo in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of artist and muse. Like many of Rodin's public commissions, Monument to Victor Hugo was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, The Times in 1909 expressed that \"there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers\". The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe\u00a0\u2013 a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work\u00a0\u2013 to express courage, labor, and struggle.\n\nWhen Balzac was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 rejected the work, and the press ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, \"there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang.\" A modern critic, indeed, claims that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.\n\nThe monument had its supporters in Rodin's day; a manifesto defending him was signed by Monet, Debussy, and future Premier Georges Clemenceau, among many others. In the BBC series Civilisation, art historian Kenneth Clark praised the monument as \"the greatest piece of sculpture of the 19th Century, perhaps, indeed, the greatest since Michelangelo.\" Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail.\n\nOther works\n\nThe popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.\n\nPortraiture was an important component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).\n\nLater, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician George Wyndham (1905), Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906), socialist (and former mistress of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII) Countess of Warwick (1908), Austrian composer Gustav Mahler (1909), former Argentine president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1911).\n\nHis undated drawing Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head is one of the works seized in 2012 from the collection of Cornelius Gurlitt.\n\nAesthetic\n\nRodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.\n\nRodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in The Thinker is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of The Thinker, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: \"What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.\"\n\nSculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments\u00a0\u2013 perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head\u00a0\u2013 took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.\n\nRodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. \"Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.\" Charles Baudelaire echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer Gluck, and wrote a book about French cathedrals. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized Van Gogh, and admired the forgotten El Greco.\n\nMethod\nInstead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: \"While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.\"\n\nHe described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through \"all the stages of art's evolution\": first, a \"Byzantine masterpiece\", then \"Bernini intermingled\", then an elegant Houdon. \"The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of Elan Vital. The Hand of God is his own hand.\"\n\nAfter he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as The Thinker), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.\n\nSince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.\n\nAs Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold The Walking Man (1899\u20131900), which was exhibited at his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio\u00a0\u2013 a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 St. John the Baptist Preaching he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.\n\nWithout finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices\u00a0\u2013 along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-naturalistic surface\u00a0\u2013 that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.\n\nLater years (1900\u20131917)\n\nBy 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.\n\nRilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such guests as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. A British journalist who visited the property noted in 1902 that in its complete isolation, there was \"a striking analogy between its situation and the personality of the man who lives in it\". Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the H\u00f4tel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.\n\nUnited States\n\nWhile Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of The Burghers of Calais, he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. However, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846\u20131924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849\u20131918).\n\nThe next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.Bust of Dalou and Burgher of Calais were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier Charles Yerkes (1837\u20131905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.\n\nOther collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840\u20131924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell. In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor's life. After Hallowell's death, her niece, the painter Harriet Hallowell, inherited the Rodins  and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.\n\nGreat Britain\nAfter the start of the 20th century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist Alphonse Legros, had introduced him to the poet William Ernest Henley. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain. (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a bust of Henley that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)\n\nThrough Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom he found further support. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.\n\nAfter the revitalization of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president. In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers. He replaced its former president, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, upon Whistler's death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of Albert Ludovici, father of English philosopher Anthony Ludovici, who was private secretary to Rodin for several months in 1906, but the two men parted company after Christmas, \"to their mutual relief.\"\n\nDuring his later creative years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.\n\nFifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. They married on 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February. Rodin was ill that year; in January, he suffered weakness from influenza, and on 16 November his physician announced that \"congestion of the lungs has caused great weakness. The patient's condition is grave.\" Rodin died the next day, age 77, at his villa in Meudon, \u00cele-de-France, on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nA cast of The Thinker was placed next to his tomb in Meudon; it was Rodin's wish that the figure served as his headstone and epitaph. In 1923, Marcell Tirel, Rodin's secretary, published a book alleging that Rodin's death was largely due to cold, and the fact that he had no heat at Meudon. Rodin requested permission to stay in the Hotel Biron, a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.\n\nLegacy\nRodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the H\u00f4tel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order L\u00e9gion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.\n\nRodin restored an ancient role of sculpture\u00a0\u2013 to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject\u00a0\u2013 and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women\u00a0\u2013 to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.\n\nRodin had enormous artistic influence. A whole generation of sculptors studied in his workshop. These include Gutzon Borglum, Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, Camille Claudel, Charles Despiau, Malvina Hoffman, Carl Milles, Fran\u00e7ois Pompon, Rodo, Gustav Vigeland, Clara Westhoff and Margaret Winser, even though Brancusi later rejected his legacy. Rodin also promoted the work of other sculptors, including Aristide Maillol and Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 whom Rodin once called \"the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors.\" Other sculptors whose work has been described as owing to Rodin include Joseph Csaky, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Bernard, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Jacques Lipchitz, Pablo Picasso, Adolfo Wildt, and Ossip Zadkine. Henry Moore acknowledged Rodin's seminal influence on his work.\n\nSeveral films have been made featuring Rodin as a prominent character or presence. These include Camille Claudel, a 1988 film in which G\u00e9rard Depardieu portrays Rodin, Camille Claudel 1915 from 2013, and Rodin, a 2017 film starring Vincent Lindon as Rodin. Furthermore, the Rodin Studios artists' cooperative housing in New York City, completed in 1917 to designs by Cass Gilbert, was named after Rodin.\n\nForgeries\nThe relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.\n\nTo deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts\u00a0\u2013 the maximum number that can be made from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.\n\nIn the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8\u00a0million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze \u00c8ve, grand modele\u00a0\u2013 version sans rocher sold for $18.9\u00a0million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture\u00a0\u2013 especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.\n\nA number of drawings previously attributed to Rodin are now known to have been forged by Ernest Durig.\n\n Citations \n\n General sources \n\n (Online Essay)\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n Corbett, Rachel (2016).

He is known for creating some of the world's most iconic sculptures, including The Thinker, The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. He is often associated with the Impressionist, Expressionist, and Symbolist movements in art and is credited with introducing a naturalistic style to sculpture. Rodin was born in Paris in 1840 and received his first artistic instruction at a young age. He studied at the Carpenters Company School of Art in Paris and later the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In 1875 he became a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts. During the 1880s he created a series of highly acclaimed sculptures, which made him famous throughout the world, including The Burghers of Calais and The Age of Bronze. His work was often marked by its realistic depictions of the human body. Rodin was also an innovator in his use of materials. He was one of the first sculptors to use cast iron and bronze, and he was one of the precursors to the modern art of welding. He also explored new techniques to create intricate surfaces, and his sculptures often incorporated mix media such as plaster, stone, and wood. He continued to explore these different techniques until his death in 1917. Throughout his career, Rodin worked on a number of major commissions including his most famous work The Gates of Hell. This vast and ambitious sculpture which incorporated over 200 figures took him nearly 30 years to complete. He also designed monuments for famous figures such as poet Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and French statesman Victor Hugo. Rodin was an incredibly influential artist whose work inspired generations of artists to come. His work deeply inspired 20th-century Expressionist and Surrealist works and has been the subject of numerous films, books, and exhibitions. He had a profound effect on modern sculpture and his works remain some of the most recognizable and celebrated pieces of art in the world. Today, his sculpture is displayed in museums across the world, including the Rodin Museum in Paris.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2065}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Morpeth, Northumberland\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Morpeth is a historic market town in Northumberland, North East England, lying on the River Wansbeck. Nearby towns include Ashington and Bedlington. In the 2011 census, the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017, up from 13,833 in the 2001 census. The earliest evidence of settlement is believed to be from the Neolithic period, and some Roman artifacts have also been found. The first written mention of the town is from 1080, when the de Merlay family was granted the barony of Morpeth. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. The de Merlay family built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid 1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1200, but the opening of the railways in the 1800s led the market to decline. The town's history is celebrated in the annual Northumbrian Gathering.\n\nMorpeth is governed by Northumberland County Council and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards \u2013 North, Kirkhill and Stobhill \u2013 for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. Morpeth railway station is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused several rail crashes. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with Morpeth Town A.F.C. having been the winner of the FA Vase in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools, a high school and seven first schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth's Carlisle Park, the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four floral clocks in England.\n\nHistory \nMorpeth was founded at a crossing point of the River Wansbeck. Remains from prehistory are scarce, but the earliest evidence of occupation found is a stone axe thought to be from the Neolithic period. There is a lack of evidence of activity during the Roman occupation of Britain, although there were probably settlements in the area at that time. The first written reference is from 1080 when William de Merlay was rewarded for his part in suppressing a rebellion in Northumbria with \"the Barony of Morthpeth stretching from the Tyne to the Coquet\". Morpeth is recorded in the Assize Rolls of Northumberland of 1256 as Morpath and Morthpath, and was also archaically spelt Morepath. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain; \"moor path\" has been suggested in reference to its historical position on the main road from England to Scotland, with the marshes around the modern-day Carlisle Park having been suggested to be the \"moor\" in question. Another possible meaning is that the name derives from the Old English pre-7th-century compound mor\u00f0-p\u00e6\u00f0 or Morthpaeth, meaning \"murder path\", in remembrance of \"some forgotten\" slaying on the road, although some old documents suggest that this meaning is a fallacy.\n\nThe barony of Morpeth was granted to the de Merlay family in around 1080, and by 1095 a motte-and-bailey castle had been built by William de Merlay. It is uncertain whether there was any settlement at Morpeth at the time that the barony was created, and documents relating to the foundation of an abbey in 1137 refer to the 'new town of Morpeth'.  Newminster Abbey, located on the outskirts of Morpeth, was founded in 1138 by William's son, Ranulf de Merlay, lord of Morpeth, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, as one of the first daughter houses of Fountains Abbey. King John granted a market charter for the town to Roger de Merlay in 1200. It became one of the main markets in Northern England by the mid 1700s and by the mid 18th century was one of the key cattle markets in England selling cattle driven by drovers over the border from Scotland; however, the opening of the railways made transport to Newcastle easier in the 19th century, and the market accordingly declined. The market is still held on Wednesdays.\n\nThe town was badly damaged by fire set by the barons in 1215 during the First Barons' War, in an attempt to block the military operations of King John. Whilst it is common report that the motte-and-bailey castle was burnt down by King John in 1216  and a new Morpeth Castle was built later in the 13th century by Ranulph de Merlay, to the south of Haw Hill, there is no firm evidence that King John destroyed the castle and an alternative narrative suggests that the second castle was in fact 'completed by William de Merlay (the 2nd) in the year of his death' (c.1170).  In the 13th century, a stone bridge was built over the Wansbeck in Morpeth, to the west of the current bridge, replacing the ford previously in use in Morpeth. For some months in 1515\u201316, Margaret Tudor (Henry VIII's sister) who was the Queen Consort of Scotland (James IV's widow), had laid ill in Morpeth Castle, having been brought there from Harbottle Castle. The only remains of the castle are the inner gatehouse, which was restored by the Landmark Trust, and parts of the ruined castle walls.\n\nIn 1540, Morpeth was described by the royal antiquary John Leland as \"long and metely well-builded, with low houses\" and \"a far fairer town than Alnwick\". During the 1543\u201351 war of the Rough Wooing, Morpeth was occupied by a garrison of Italian mercenaries, who \"pestered such a little street standing in the highway\" by killing deer and withholding payment for food. In 1552, William Hervey, Norroy King of Arms, granted the borough of Morpeth a coat of arms. The arms were the same as those granted to Roger de Merlay, but with the addition of a gold tower. In the letters patent, Hervey noted that he had included the arms of the \"noble and valyaunt knyght ... for a p'petuall memory of his good will and benevolence towardes the said towne\".\n\nMorpeth was a borough by prescription, but received its first charter of confirmation from Charles II. The corporation it created was controlled by seven companies: the Merchant Tailors, the Tanners, the Fullers and Dyers, the Smiths, the Cordwainers, the Weavers and the Butchers. This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. During the Second World War, RAF Morpeth, an air-gunnery training school, opened at nearby Tranwell.\n\nThe town and the county's history and culture are celebrated at the annual Northumbrian Gathering. \nThe gathering is held over a weekend in mid-April and includes the Border Cavalcade and Pageant. The 50th gathering took place in 2017.\n\nGovernance \nMorpeth has two tiers of local government.\n\nThe lower tier is Morpeth Town Council, which has 15 members. Morpeth is a civil parish with the status of a town. For the purposes of parish elections the town is divided into three wards: North, Kirkhill and Stobhill, each returning five town councillors. Each ward also elects one County Councillor. In May 2021, the political make up of the Town Council was ten Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two Green and one Labour member.\n\nThe upper tier of local government is Northumberland County Council, which meets at County Hall in Morpeth. Since April 2009 the county council has been a unitary authority. Previous to this there was an intermediate tier, the non-metropolitan district of Castle Morpeth, which has been abolished along with all other districts in the county. The county council has 67 councillors, of whom three represent Morpeth, one each from the electoral wards of Morpeth Kirkhill, Morpeth North and Morpeth Stobhill. The 2017 and 2021 County Council elections both elected three Conservative councillors for the three wards.\n\nClimate \nCockle Park, located slightly north of Morpeth, contains a Met Office weather station, founded in 1897.\n\n2008 and 2012 floods\n\nOn 6 September 2008, Morpeth suffered a severe flood, causing damage to 1,000 properties and leading 400 residents to be evacuated. The town's flood defences were breached after 12 hours, when a month's worth of rain fell on Morpeth.\n\nIn September 2012, flooding occurred again, causing damage to properties, although floodwaters were reportedly  shallower than in 2008.\n\nFlood defences\nWork on flood defences started in 2013 in response to the 2008 floods. New flood defences were built in the town centre and a dam with a storage reservoir was built on the Mitford Estate. A second \u00a327m dam was completed in May 2017 to reduce flooding from the Cotting Burn and marked the completion of the Morpeth flood defence plan.\n\nTransport \nThe A1, the longest numbered road in the UK, used to pass through Morpeth until the bypass was opened in 1970. Morpeth's railway station is on the main East Coast Main Line which runs between London and Edinburgh. To the south of the station is a sharp curve which has been the scene of several train crashes. A non-passenger line operates between Morpeth and Bedlington. A former line, closed in 1966, ran west from Morpeth to Scots Gap (from where there was a branch line to Rothbury), then west to Redesmouth, and lastly south to Hexham.\n\nEducation \n\nThe local state school, King Edward VI School, was originally founded as a chantry school in the early 14th century and was located in the Morpeth Chantry. The school was refounded in 1552 by royal charter as the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, being commonly referred to as the Morpeth Grammar School by locals. The school was renamed to King Edward VI Grammar School by 1947 and in the 1970s lost its grammar school status, becoming a comprehensive under the current name.\n\nThe town has two middle schools, Newminster and Chantry, which are built next door to one another. It also has several first schools: Abbeyfields First School in Kirkhill, Morpeth First School in Loansdean to the south of the town, Stobhillgate First School in the Stobhillgate housing estate, and Morpeth All Saints' Church of England-aided First School in Lancaster Park, which is located north of the town. Additionally, St. Robert's R.C. First School, a primary school for Roman Catholics, is located in Oldgate, Morpeth.\n\nReligious sites\n\nChurch of England\nThe ancient Church of England parish church of Morpeth is St Mary's at High Church, which was the main Anglican place of worship in the area until the 1840s. The church is mostly in the 14th century style. The grave of Emily Wilding Davison lies in St Mary's graveyard.\n\nIn 1843, a public meeting was called to address the lack of attendance at the church, and it was found that the walk to the current church, then on the southern edge of the town, was too much for many of the parishioners. From this meeting, it was decided to build a new church in the town centre and accordingly, the church of St James the Great was consecrated for worship on 15 October 1846. Benjamin Ferrey designed the church in a \"Neo-Norman\" style, based on the 12th century Monreale Cathedral, Sicily.\n\nA third parish church, St Aidan's, was founded as a mission church in 1957, located on the Stobhill estate on the south-east of the town.\n\nRoman Catholic Church\nMorpeth's Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to St Robert of Newminster, was built off Oldgate on land adjacent to Admiral Lord Collingwood's house. It opened on 1 August 1850 and was consecrated by the Right Reverend, William Hogarth, Bishop of Samosata (later Bishop of Hexham). Collingwood House is now the presbytery (residence) for the priest in charge of the Church.\n\nUnited Reformed Church\nMorpeth has had a Presbyterian ministry since 1693. Their first service was held in a tannery loft in the town in February 1693 and in 1721 a chapel was built in Cottingwood Lane, which still exists as a private home. The construction of St. George's United Reformed Church began in 1858 and the first service in the new building was held on 12 April 1860. The Church stands immediately to the north of the Telford Bridge and is in the style of the early English era, containing a stained glass rose window and an octagonal spirelet.\n\nMethodist Church\nThe present Methodist Church in Howard Terrace was opened as a Primitive Methodist place of worship on 24 April 1905. Designed by J. Walton Taylor, it was built from local quarry stone. Although the Primitive Methodists were united with the Wesleyan Church to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932, a separate Wesleyan Church continued to function in Manchester Street until 1964, when the congregations were united at Howard Terrace. The former Wesleyan Church (built in 1883) is currently used as the Boys' Brigade headquarters.\n\nSport \nMorpeth Town A.F.C., Morpeth RFC and the Morpeth Golf Club play competitively within Morpeth. In addition, the Morpeth Harriers compete in athletics. The town also offers opportunities to play sport on a non-competitive basis through facilities such as Carlisle Park, the common for playing golf and football, and the Riverside leisure centre for swimming, indoor sports and fitness gym activities. Morpeth Town A.F.C. was the 2016 winner of the FA Vase.\n\nThe Morpeth Olympic Games, a professional event consisting mainly of athletics and wrestling, were staged from 1873 until 1958, barring interruptions during the two world wars. The Games were held on the Old Brewery Field until 1896, then at Grange House Field until the First World War. After two years at the town's cricket pitch at Stobhill (1919\u201320), the Olympics moved to Mount Haggs Field until 1939, and then back to Grange House Field after the war until the end of the games in 1958.\n\nIn 1730, a racecourse was built for horse racing, which was used until 1854, when the racetrack was replaced with St. George's Hospital.\n\nThe town was the start point of the Morpeth To Newcastle Road Race. It was held annually on New Year's Day from 1902 to 2004, when insurance and policing costs became prohibitively high, and winners included Commonwealth champion Jack Holden and Olympic medallist Mike McLeod.\n\nLandmarks \n\nThe historical layout of central Morpeth consisted of Bridge Street, Oldgate Street and Newgate Street, with burgage plots leading off them. Traces of this layout remain: Old Bakehouse Yard off Newgate Street is a former burgage plot, as is Pretoria Avenue, off Oldgate. The town stands directly on what used to be the Great North Road, the old coaching route between London and Edinburgh.\n\nCarlisle Park is located on the southern bank of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth. The park has the William Turner Garden, one of the only four floral clocks in England, a statue of Emily Wilding Davison, as well as other facilities and attractions. Morpeth's Mafeking Park, at the bottom of Station Bank, was unsuccessfully put forward by locals to be listed as the smallest park in the world in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nOther landmarks are:\n\n Morpeth Clock Tower, a free-standing 17th century clock tower\n Morpeth Town Hall, originally designed by Sir John Vanbrugh (rebuilt 1869)\n Collingwood House, the Georgian home of Admiral Lord Collingwood\n Morpeth Chantry, a 13th-century chapel that now houses the town's tourist information centre and the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum\n Morpeth Castle, which stands on a hill to the south, is now operated by the Landmark Trust as holiday accommodation\n A nuclear bunker located underneath Morpeth County Hall\n A gateway on High Stanners framed by a whale's jawbone\n Ruins of Newminster Abbey, a former Cistercian abbey about one mile to the west of Morpeth\n\nNotable people \n\n Lawrence William Adamson (1829\u20131911), High Sheriff of Northumberland, who died at Linden Hall near Morpeth in 1911\n James (Jim) Alder  (born 1940), athlete, who spent his childhood in Morpeth after being adopted by Adler family\n\n Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge (1817\u20131892), founder of Bainbridge Department Store\u00a0\u2013 the first such store in the world\u00a0\u2013 in Newcastle upon Tyne, who, from 1877, lived near Morpeth at Eshott Hall\n Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham (1849\u20131931), born at Linden Hall, near Morpeth, who became private secretary to Queen Victoria and George V\n Robert Blakey (1795\u20131878), radical journalist and philosopher, born in Manchester Street, Morpeth\n\n Luke Clennell (1781\u20131840), engraver and painter, born in Morpeth\n Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood (1748\u20131810), Royal Navy Admiral.

The town is home to a range of educational facilities, including Morpeth Training College, one of the first educational establishments of its type in the North East of England. Morpeth's High Street is lined with a variety of independent shops and restaurants, many of which have been operating for generations. The town is also home to an annual carnival, first established in 1838. Morpeth has often been called the \u201cGarden Town of Northumberland\u201d due to its abundance of parks and gardens. The town\u2019s riverside meadows were once famously described by novelist Thomas Hardy as \u201cmagnificently undulating\u201d. Morpeth is also home to a number of historic sites, including Chantry House, built in the early 16th century; the Corn Exchange; and Kirkhill Tower, a late 14th century house.

It was operational from 1941 to 2000, serving as a training centre during the Second World War, and playing an important role in the Cold War. History RAF Dalton was built in 1941 as a grass airfield with three runways. During the Second World War it served as a Bomber Command station and an Operational Training Unit for Wellington bombers. After the war, it served as a training establishment for pilots, navigators and air gunners. In 1958, it became a Front Line Fighter base and in the early 1960s, No.37 Squadron moved in with its English Electric Lightning Fighter jets. Later during the Cold War, the squadron flew the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, until being disbanded in 1981. By then, the base was renowned for its air displays, having a large collection of aircraft and pilots remaining from No.37 Squadron. In the 1950s and 60s, the station had three runways, the most northerly one being the longest. At the end of the runway was a bombing range located in the Yorkshire Wolds. RAF Dalton also had a variety of domestic facilities, including a post office, cinema and two Naphill beer-cellars. The base was closed in 2000 and in December 2016, a closure ceremony was held with the attendance of members from No. 37 Squadron. In June 2019, the former airfield was sold to Stonewater, a housing provider. They plan to build 900 new homes and allocate 50% of all jobs to the local workforce. RAF Dalton will still be remembered by the locals who will forever keep the memory alive. Today, the base still retains its impressive control tower, which is open for the public to visit. The control tower is also available for private hire. The area around the former airfield is now a mix of pasture and woodland, which is used as a relaxing escape by local people.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ajmer Dargah bombing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ajmer Dargah bombing (also called the Ajmer Sharif blast) occurred on 11 October 2007, in the courtyard of Sufi maulana Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India, after the Iftar period had started. On 22 March 2017 a Special NIA Court convicted three Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharaks Devendra Gupta, Bhavesh Patel and Sunil Joshi. Sunil Joshi and Devendra Gupta were found guilty on charges of conspiracy and Bhavesh Bhai Patel was found guilty of planting the explosive on the blast site. Gupta and Patel were awarded life imprisonment. Sunil Joshi had been found shot dead in mysterious circumstances soon after the blast in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAttack\nAt 6.12\u00a0pm on 11 October 2007, an explosion occurred near a courtyard outside the Dargah of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer. Evening prayers had just concluded before the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and a crowd had gathered outside the shrine to end their fast. The bomb had been concealed in a tiffin carrier, which workers typically used to store their lunch. The blast killed 3 people and injured 17 others. Remnants of a mobile phone were retrieved from the site. Lalit Maheswari of the Ajmer police stated, \"We have recovered some mobile instruments, so we think some sophisticated device was used ...\".\n\nInvestigations\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (India) initially stated that the blast could have been the responsibility of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. The media had also initially characterized the attack as part of a conflict between ultra-conservative Islamic extremists against the Sufi-derived Islamic traditions popular in India.\n\nThe focus of investigation shifted to Hindu groups when Swami Aseemanand was arrested in the Mecca Masjid blast case in Dec 2010.\n\nOn 22 October 2010, five suspects, who had been arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad of India, were charged with conspiracy in connection to the bombing. Four of the five suspects were connected to the Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\n\nAccording to sources, Patel was part of the five-member group that planted the bomb at Ajmer Dargah. While two planters 'Harshad Solanki and Mukesh Vasani' have already been charge sheeted, Patel was part of a back-up team, including Suresh Nair and Mehul alias Mafat Bhai, which went to the site as a contingency plan to take charge of the affairs in case the two planters failed to place the bomb or developed cold feet.\n\nOn 10 October 2007, Suresh Nair, Mehul and Bhavesh Patel took a consignment of explosives from Sunil Joshi, who was later found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Godhra. They reached Vadodara on the same day and boarded a private bus for Udaipur. At Ajmer, however, the bomb was given to Solanki and Vasani planted it. Patel was also accused of having been involved in the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, but was acquitted by the court.\n\nNIA also filed another charge sheet against Swami Aseemanand, whose confession helped the agency open Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid blast and Malegaon 2006 blast cases, along with Sandeep Dangae, Bhawesh Patel, Mehul, Suresh Bhai, Ramchandra Kalsangra, Sunil Joshi and Bharat Bhai. According to the charge sheet filed, Swami Aseemanand conceived the plan to avenge Islamic attacks on Hindu temples.\n\nIn 2011, the Central Bureau of Investigation started investigating the Hindutva organisation, Abhinav Bharat on the basis of Aseemanands confession. Swami Aseemanand's named the co-founder of the far right Hindu organisation, Abhinav Bharat, \nPrasad Shrikant Purohit and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar among others as co-conspirators. The Swami in his statement also claimed that Sunil Joshi was the operational man and carried out the blast in Ajmer with the help of two Muslim boys from the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, who were given to him by Indresh Kumar.\n\nAnother individual accused in the attack was Bharat Bhai alias Bharat Rateshwar, who is also accused of financing several other Hindutva terrorist attacks such the Mecca Masjid blast and the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings. He was accused of funding and planning terrorist attacks on Muslim to avenge the attacks on Hindus in India.\n\nConviction\nOn 8 March 2017, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jaipur found guilty three ex-RSS pracharaks, Bhavesh Patel, Devendra Gupta, and Sunil Joshi (who was murdered in 2007). Both Patel and Gupta were awarded life imprisonments and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively. Swami Aseemanand and 6 other accused were acquitted, giving them the \"benefit of doubt\". At the same time, the court questioned the NIA on its clean chit to two of the other accused, Ramesh Gohil and Amit, as well as \"suspicious persons\" such as the senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar and Pragya Singh Thakur stating that it could not be done without invoking appropriate sections of CrPC. Pragya Singh Thakur later went on to be elected as Member of parliament, Lok Sabha from Bhopal in May 2019.\n\nSee also\n2006 Malegaon blasts\n2007 Samjhauta Express bombings\n2008 Malegoan & Modasa bombing\nList of terrorist incidents, 2007\nSaffron Terror\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \nIn the words of a zealot\u2026.

The attack claimed the lives of three people and injured 17, including a member of the shrine\u2019s management committee. The shrine is considered to be one of the most important Sufi shrines in the world, and is a prominent destination for Muslims and Hindus alike, who travel to pay respects to the 13th century Sufi saint, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. At approximately 6.14 pm on October 11, 2007, three bombs were detonated within the courtyard of the shrine within a span of fifteen minutes. One of the bombs exploded near a gate and caused the most damage, resulting in the deaths of three pilgrims and injuring 17, including 9 members of the shrine's management staff. Hindus and Muslims alike were appalled by the attack on the sacred shrine, with the state government of Rajasthan abruptly cancelling the famed Pushkar camel fair, out of respect for the victims and to ensure security at the Dargah. The state police force acted swiftly, and arrested one suspect, Devendra Gupta, within days of the attack, later raiding various residences of alleged accomplices. Through further investigation of the bombing, three alleged accomplices, Sunil Joshi, Sandeep V Dange and Ramchandra Kalsangra, were subsequently arrested. The four men were charged with terrorism, attempted murder and other criminal activities, including illegal possession of explosives. The case was officially closed in December 2018 with the conviction of five men. Devendra Gupta, Sunil Joshi, Sandeep V.

H. Plumptre, in Anglican bishop Charles Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers, commented that the events reported \"are common to St. Mark and St. Luke, but are not narrated\u2026 in the same order\". Free Church minister William Robertson Nicoll suggested that \"this collection is not arranged in chronological order. The connection is topical, not temporal.\" In his opinion these stories \"are an integral part of the self-revelation of Jesus by word and deed; they are demonstrations not merely of His power, but above all, of His spirit\".\n\nNew Testament scholar Dale Allison notes that, along with chapter 9, these \"merciful deeds\" performed by Jesus are all undertaken for the benefit of \"people from the margins of Jewish society or without status\".\n\nSee also \n Book of Leviticus\n Leper\n Moses\n Related Bible parts: Leviticus 14, Joshua 10, Isaiah 53, Mark 1, 4 and 5, Luke 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9, John 4\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n King James Bible - Wikisource\nEnglish Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate\nOnline Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English)\nMultiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.)\n\n \nMatthew 08", "machine_text": " Matthew 8 is the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It contains Jesus' curing of a centurion's servant, the expulsion of many demons from two men, and a stilling of the storm. In the beginning of the chapter, Jesus is approached by a centurion who asks Him to heal his servant. Jesus offers to come to the centurion's house and heal the servant Himself, but the centurion states that he is not worthy of such an honor and believes that Jesus' word alone will be enough to do the job. Jesus is impressed by the centurion's faith and says that he will not find such faith in Israel. He then heals the servant from afar. Verse 24 is the start of the stilling of the storm, when Jesus and His disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. As soon as they do, a severe storm comes upon them and Jesus is sleeping. The disciples wake Him up, scared that they will drown, yet Jesus demonstrates His power over nature by commanding the wind and the sea to be still. Instantly, the storm stops and there is a great calm. The first part of the chapter concludes with Jesus' arrival in the land of the Gadarenes. He meets two men possessed by many demons and casts them out. At the command of Jesus, the demons enter a herd of pigs, which then run down a steep bank into the sea and are drown. The second part of the chapter consists of Jesus healing many of the sick people in the region. He touches them and they are instantly healed. He also casts out many demons and is even asked to go away by the people because they are afraid of Him. Matthew 8 is a very important chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, as it is an example of Jesus' power and authority over creation. This power and authority are key points throughout the New Testament, and this chapter emphasizes it with Jesus' stilling of the storm, healing of the sick, and expelling of the demons. In addition, the centurion's faith is an example of what it means to have faith in Jesus.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4770637}

Liu was born to a prominent family in Eyang (Yixing), Jiangsu. He had an older brother, Liu Tingen (\u5289\u5ef7\u6839), who was a member of the Forum. At the age of 24, Liu passed the Imperial examinations and was appointed as a provincial official in Wangdu Prefecture (\u671b\u90fd\u7e23) in modern Hebei. In 1054, Liu was appointed as governor of Hedong (\u6cb3\u6771), a strategic port and military base in modern Shandong. During this tenure, he was faced with the complexity of Qiang nomads, who often crossed the borders and raided border regions. In 1064, Liu was appointed as a commander in the imperial army and led a detachment of troops to fight against the Tanguts of the Western Xia. Liu then played a decisive role in the Battle of Chengdu, which was a crucial battle in the war. During the battle, the Song army successfully routed the Tangut forces, routing them from their capital, Zhuozhou (\u6dbf\u5dde). In 1068, Liu was appointed to lead a naval attack on the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty, a hostile northern neighbour. He led the successful attack on the strategic ports located in the mouth of the Yalu River (\u70cf\u723e\u6d41\u6cb3). Despite inflicting heavy casualties, Liu's forces were eventually forced to retreat due to the superiority of the Jin forces.

His ambition and success earned him recognition in Harvard and he was invited to deliver addresses there on botany and natural history. By the age of forty-five, Henry had devoted much of his time and wealth to philanthropic activities, including the founding of the Sloan Foundation in 1845. The mission of the Sloan Foundation was to advance knowledge of the natural sciences and promote research in science, engineering and mathematics. Henry also wanted the Foundation to promote social reform and fund charitable activities to improve the lives of the poor. He strongly believed that scientific advancement should not be limited to the privileged classes and that everyone should have access to education and opportunity. Henry devoted the remainder of his life to expanding the Sloan Foundation. He set up the first scientific scholarships in 1851 and funded numerous educational reforms and research initiatives. His philanthropic efforts were heavily influenced by the ideals of the 19th century American Transcendental Movement and his contribution to science and society was widely appreciated. Henry Sloan passed away in 1852 after a long illness, leaving his fortune in the care of his nephew and sole heir, Edwin M. Sloan.

Kingsland Bridge is a two-span, wrought iron and masonry structure, featuring two parabolic arches, each one built with 400 tonnes of Welsh granite. The arches span a distance of 36 metres, creating a total width of 18 metres, rising far above its original foundation. At the end of the 19th century, Kingsland Bridge became a centre of community and leisure activities. A pedestrian pathway was added in the 1920s, which allowed relative freedom of movement until it was closed off to pedestrians again in the early 1990s, due to its increasing dilapidation. Despite its closure, the bridge has slowly been refurbished, in order to preserve it as a historic site. In recent years, a number of facelifts have been applied, including the installation of new lighting, balustrades and fencing, and aesthetic restoration to the masonry. Nowadays, Kingsland Bridge is a popular destination for tourists and local enthusiasts alike. Situated in a scenic area with the River Tyne running directly underneath, many people stop to appreciate its architecture and observe the river's surrounding views.

Two tanker barges were coming down empty from Sharpness, the Wyesdale H and the Wharfedale H, tied together and both being steered from the Wyesdale H. The steersman failed to see the rescue boat, as the boat had no navigation lights, and both barges collided with it. One man was saved, but the other crew member of the rescue boat was drowned.\n4 September 1990, three men were working in one of the four maintenance gantries attached to the underside of the Severn Bridge, carrying out routine maintenance work. The gantry gave way plunging the three men into the Severn. Mark Seaton (19), a painter, survived the  drop, but Robin Phelps (44) and Eric Sullivan (46) were killed.\n\nSee also\nCrossings of the River Severn\nList of shipwrecks in the Bristol Channel (for shipwrecks downstream of the Severn Bridge)\nSevern Area Rescue Association\n\nReferences\n\nRiver Severn\nSevern\nSevern\nDisasters\nDisasters", "machine_text": " The Severn is one of the longest rivers in the United Kingdom, rising in Wales and flowing through the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Avon before emptying into the Bristol Channel. Its 447 km (278 mi) long course has been witness to some major disasters in history. This is a list of some of the most notable disasters of the Severn estuary throughout the centuries. 1796: The Severn Rai Wreck - In November of 1796, a large merchant ship carrying supplies to France attempted to cross the Severn in stormy weather, which led to its sinking off the coast of Abbotsbury. The vessel, captained by William Millar, was heavily loaded with valuable cargo and could not be salvaged immediatly. 1907: The RMS Severn Grounding - In March of 1907, a passenger ship carrying around 200 passengers ran aground near Weston Super Mare due to poor visibility and strong winds. The vessel suffered substantial damage and was subsequently declared a total loss. 1944: The Bristol Channel Spitfire Incident - In October 1944, a Spitfire fighter plane piloted by Flight Sergeant William Wilkinson crashed into the Severn estuary near Lavernock Point. The body of the pilot was never found and the cause of the incident remains a mystery. 1961: Chipperfield\u2019s Circus Accident - In November 1961, a troupe of performing elephants from Chipperfield\u2019s Circus were travelling from Bristol to Cardiff on the Severn Ferry when the vessel suffered a mechanical breakdown in a storm. One of the elephants died after being thrown overboard and the others had to be rescued. 1991: Severn Bridge Collapse - In December 1991, an expansion joint in the Severn Bridge collapsed due to a build-up of corrosion, causing huge traffic delays. The bridge was closed for maintenance and was eventually rebuilt at a cost of \u00a3125 million. These are just a few of the disasters that have occurred on the Severn throughout the years. Despite its treacherous past, the Severn continues to be an important transport and trade route in the United Kingdom.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7932170}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mountains and hills of England\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The mountains and hills of England comprise very different kinds of terrain, from a mountain range which reaches almost  high, to several smaller areas of lower mountains, foothills and sea cliffs. Most of the major upland areas have been designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) or national parks. The highest and most extensive areas are in the north and west (including south-west), while the midlands, south-east and east of the country tend to be low-lying.\n\nEngland\n\nThe Kents (England's 1,000-Foot Hills)\nThe highest 3,805 hills in England, all of those between 1,000.00 feet and 1,999.99 feet, are identified and listed in the England's 1,000-Foot Peaks book, by Jeff Kent, which was published in 2021. The author called the peaks, as an entity, The Kents in honour of his parents. There are 3,805 Complete Kents and 1,640 Greater Kents, which have a relative height of at least fifty feet. All the Kents have a rank, height (in feet and metres) and a grid reference of their summits. The highest Complete Kent is Tynehead Fell, in Cumbria, at 1,999.67 feet (609.50 metres) and the tallest Greater Kent is Slack's Ridge, in the same shire, with an altitude of 1,995.41 feet (608.20 metres). The Kents are spread across 18 English ceremonial counties. Cumbria contains the most 1,000-foot peaks, with 929 Complete Kents and 389 Greater Kents, and Gloucestershire the fewest, with 5 Complete Kents and 4 Greater Kents.\n\nNorthern England\n\nLake District\n\nThe North of England includes the country's highest mountains, in the Lake District of Cumbria. This was one of the first national parks to be established in the United Kingdom, in 1951. The highest peak is Scafell Pike, , and at least three other summits exceed  making them Furth Munros. The mountains are chiefly Ordovician slates and volcanic rocks, with some limestone and outcrops of other rock types. The peaks were catalogued and described in Alfred Wainwright's seminal Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series of books, which listed 214 summits, which have subsequently become known as Wainwrights.\n\nCheviot Hills\nNorth of Hadrian's Wall and the Tyne Valley, the land rises to form the Cheviot Hills, which extend into Scotland and could probably be considered part of either the Southern Uplands or the northern Pennines. They are included in Northumberland National Park, along with Kielder Water and the Kielder Forest.\n\nPennines\n\nThe North Pennines (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, or AONB) lie south of Hadrian's Wall, and east of the Lake District, from which they are separated by the Eden Valley. These are younger rocks, mostly Carboniferous limestone, and the mountains are characterised by shallower slopes covered with moorland vegetation, culminating in Cross Fell at .\n\nSouth of this, the main line of the Pennines (often called \"the backbone of England\") continues into the Yorkshire Dales, a limestone-dominated area of broad valleys and moorland. The Yorkshire Three Peaks are some of the highest summits in the area, which became a national park in 1954.\n\nThe Yorkshire Dales end at Skipton, and a short distance to the south is a range of moors that rises up between the urban cores of Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. The range has no continuous name - the western part as far as Blackburn is called the West Pennine Moors, the eastern part north of the A646 (including the famous Ilkley Moor) is called the South Pennines, and the small area in between is known as the Forest of Rossendale. These three groups of hills are dominated by peat bogs over Millstone Grit, and merge into the northern part of the Peak District, known as the Dark Peak. These areas of West Yorkshire are marketed as \"Bront\u00eb country\", and the local landscape provided inspiration for many of the works of the Bront\u00eb sisters, including most famously, Wuthering Heights.\n\nThe Forest of Bowland AONB, in Lancashire is a western spur of the Pennines. It is separated from the surrounding Yorkshire Dales and South Pennines by the Aire Gap and Ribble Valley. The isolated Pendle Hill falls within the boundaries of the AONB.\n\nThe Peak District was another of the original national parks designated in 1951, and remains one of the most popular in the country, largely because of its proximity to several large cities. One end of the Pennine Way, the first long-distance footpath in the British Isles, is in Edale, in the Peak District, while the other end is at Kirk Yetholm, in the Southern Uplands of Scotland.\n\nThe southern part of the Peak District (White Peak), around Buxton and the Hope Valley, is another limestone area, with a number of caves, especially around Castleton. The Peak District marks the southern end of the Pennine chain, as it peters out into the lowlands of the English Midlands.\n\nHowgill Fells\nThe Howgill Fells are an area of uplands in Cumbria lying between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. The area falls within the boundaries of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and are sometimes considered as a western spur of the Pennines.\n\nOrton Fells\nThe Orton Fells are an area of limestone uplands in Cumbria lying between the Lake District and the Eden Valley. The area mostly falls within the boundaries of the Yorkshire Dales National Park with a small part lying in the Lake District National Park. Like the Howgill Fells, the area may be considered a western spur of the Pennines as it predominantly lies in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\n\nNorth York Moors\nNear the North Yorkshire coastal towns of Whitby and Scarborough, and extending inland as far as Thirsk, the North York Moors are one of the few major upland areas in eastern England. Reaching a maximum height of  at Urra Moor, the North York Moors are home to the RAF Fylingdales radar base. The Jurassic limestone rocks are rich in fossils, which are regularly exposed by erosion of the sea cliffs.\n\nMidlands\n\nThe English Midlands are predominantly flat in character, although isolated hills such as Turners Hill can command extensive views. Upland areas lie to the north and west, with parts of the Peak District extending to the north while the Shropshire Hills in the west, close to the Welsh border, reach heights of over , including the Long Mynd, Clee Hills and Stiperstones ridge. Wenlock Edge, running through the middle of the Shropshire Hills AONB, is a long, low ridge, which extends for over . Further south, the Welsh border reaches over  high, at Black Mountain, which is thus the highest point in Herefordshire.\n\nThe Malverns are made from some of the oldest rock in England (around 680 million years old) and extend some  through two West Midlands counties Worcestershire and Herefordshire as well as northern Gloucestershire in the southwest. The highest point of the hills is the Worcestershire Beacon at  above sea level (OS Grid reference SO768452).\n\nThe Cotswolds extend over , and over six counties (Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Warwickshire and Worcestershire), but centred on Gloucestershire. They reach  high at Cleeve Hill, and were designated an AONB in 1966.\n\nAreas of lower hills in the Midlands include Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire and the Lincolnshire Wolds.\n\nSouth East England\nSouth East England, including East Anglia and London, is also predominantly flat. The underlying rock is chalk, and meaningful heights are only attained in the Chiltern Hills (Haddington Hill: ), the North Wessex Downs (Walbury Hill: ), the North Downs (Leith Hill: ) and the South Downs (which includes the chalk cliffs at Beachy Head and Seven Sisters).\n\nSouth West England\n\nSouth of Bristol and Bath, the Mendip Hills (Black Down: ) are the first group of hills in South West England. The Purbeck Hills (and their continuation onto the Isle of Wight) line the south coast, and a number of other groups of hills are also present in the area: the Quantock Hills (Will's Neck: ), Blackdown Hills, Dorset Downs, Salisbury Plain and Cranborne Chase. Glastonbury Tor, although of only modest height (), is significant for its claimed association with Arthurian legend.\n\nThe highest and largest upland areas in the south-west are, however, the moors of the South-west Peninsula. Exmoor, in northern Somerset, and abutting the Bristol Channel, reaches  at Dunkery Beacon, and is famous as the setting of Lorna Doone. Dartmoor, in Devon, reaches over  (High Willhays: ), and was the landscape for The Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nBodmin Moor, further to the south-west, is smaller (Brown Willy: ), and is perhaps best known for the Beast of Bodmin Moor. Like Dartmoor, it is a granite plateau, whereas Exmoor is formed from Devonian sediments.\n\nSee also\nHill lists in the British Isles\nList of English counties by highest point\nList of Hewitts and Nuttalls in England\n\nReferences", "machine_text": " Mountains and hills of England are a range of elevations in the form of hills and mountains in the nation of England.

It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is closely related to the species Malva sylvestris and Malva parviflora. The plant grows in maritime bluffs, sand dunes and similar environments, forming low-growing mats up to 1m in diameter. The plant is an erect annual herb with an erect stem and generally reaching heights of 20 to 100 cm tall when mature.The leaves have a mallow-like flavor and are usually heart-shaped, often with toothed edges, and are 4 to 15 cm long and 3 to 12 cm wide. Flowers are bright purple or pinkish in colour, with five leaflets around 5\u201313 cm in diameter. The flowers feature five petals and a calyx that is green when young and later turns purplish. When in bloom, the plant's flowers create a carpet of purple over the islands. The edible leaves of M. assurgentiflora are tasty, albeit limited, and can be used in salads and similar dishes. The fruits also have culinary potential, with a flavor similar to strawberries. The fruits are edible but because of their high levels of oxalic acid and mucilage, should not be ingested in large amounts. The Island Mallow is a nit-fixing species and therefore can act as a soil improver, reducing the growth of weeds and improving soil fertility. As the plant grows in maritime dunes, it can stabilise dune systems and prevent erosion by wind and sea. The plant also provides habitat and food for local invertebrates, forming an important part of coastal meadows. In addition, the flower production of this species provides an important food source for other wildlife species. Birds, bees, and other small animals such as the Island Mallow Snail (Succinea californiensis) can all benefit from the plant's nectar and fruits. Although Malva assurgentiflora is threatened on the California Channel Islands, it is a hardy species that grows in various conditions, excluding areas of high salinity or extreme temperatures. Populations of the species have been successfully established in Hawaii, Australia, and New Zealand, suggesting that it may be suitable for cultivation in most temperate regions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9694506}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Heirs of Empire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Heirs of Empire is a 1996 military science fiction novel by American writer David Weber. It is the third novel in the Dahak trilogy, after the de facto duology of Mutineers' Moon and The Armageddon Inheritance. Heirs of Empire is a stand-alone work that focuses on the adventures and travails of the fraternal twin children of Emperor Colin MacIntyre (who defeated the eponymous mutineers and the Achuultani incursion in  The Armageddon Inheritance) and their three friends. In 2003, it was republished in the omnibus volume, Empire from the Ashes.\n\nPlot summary \n\nThe story opens approximately 20 years after The Armageddon Inheritance. The human race has largely recovered from the Siege of Earth by the Achuultani and the Bia system is being slowly re-colonized and its defenses re-activated. In short, the Empire is largely at peace, busy assimilating the technological advances of the Fourth Empire and building and manning a fleet to take the war back to the Achuultani and the master computer controlling them. The captured Achuultani have prospered; with the aid of cloning, their ranks have swollen and they have colonized a planet called Narhan, which was unsuitable to humans by reason of its heavy gravity - for this reason they have renamed themselves the Narhani. They are fervently loyal to the reborn Empire and Colin, enraged by the perversion of their race by the master computer. Brashieel's clone-child (Brashieel is now the head Narhani) Brashan, is one of Sean and Harriet MacIntyre's closest friends (Sean and Harriet being Colin and Jiltanith's two children).\n\nThe only flies in the ointment are the worrying fact that some of Anu's agents remain at large, and that a small but increasingly violent faction that considers the Narhani to be minions of the anti-christ and want to kill all Narhani; these two factions are secretly working against the Emperor.\n\nInto this volatile situation step Sean, Harry, Brashan, Sandy (daughter of Hector MacMahan and Ninhursag), and Tamman (the son of Amanda Tsien and Tamman), who have all enlisted in Battle Fleet.\n\nAfter graduation from the Academy, the four depart on a newly constructed planetoid warship, Imperial Terra, for their midshipman cruise. Unbeknownst to them, one of Anu's former minions, Lawrence Jefferson, had worked his way up to Lieutenant Governor of Earth, and has commenced his plan to become Emperor through assassinating everyone ahead of him in the line of succession. Under his instructions, Jefferson's personal band of religious terrorists, \"The Sword of God\", takes one of the planetoid's programmer's family hostage, and order him to sabotage Imperial Terra. The task is accomplished, and the programmer and his family are all murdered to cover it up.\n\nThe Imperial Terra departs on its maiden voyage, but partway through deliberately loses control of its core tap, as the dead programmer had instructed. However, Dahak had surreptitiously inserted a command with equal priority to the sabotage command which states that the lives of 2 certain midshipmen and their friends must be preserved. Imperial Terra reconciles these conflicting orders by first jettisoning the four aboard a well-stocked and capable (but not FTL-capable) battleship moderately near some uncharted systems and only then destroying itself and its crew of 80 thousand.\n\nLater, Sandy, Harry, Brashan, Sean, and Tamman arrive at the nearest potentially inhabited system. They barely survive the onslaught of a quarantine system, and decide to sneak onto the life-bearing world the space-borne Imperial weaponry seem to be protecting.  Amazingly, it seems that the bio-weapon that had killed the Fourth Empire had missed this world.\n\nAfter landing and investigating the ruins of a high-tech enclave, the five piece together the true history of the planet the indigenous inhabitants call \"Pardal\".\n\nOnce, Pardal had been an out-of-the-way minor planet of the Empire. Because it was out of the way, its governor managed to shut down the mat-trans system before Pardal was infected by the bio-weapon when the first warnings went out across the hypercoms, and also to devise with her chief engineer an extremely effective quarantine system. However, even as they hunkered down behind their orbital defenses, the hypercom  continued to operate \"like a comlink to hell\" (pg 255), broadcasting the prolonged death of the Empire, and even more devastatingly, messages from worlds like Pardal which were fooled by the bio-weapon's long incubation period into thinking they were safe. The horrified backlash by Pardal's populace centered on destroying Pardal's technological infrastructure, and erasing all scientific accomplishment and knowledge more advanced than the Dark Ages, so another such horror could never arise. The civil and military authorities concentrated on creating a global theocracy (reminiscent of the Catholic Church) dedicated to the suppression of technological advancement and to the maintenance of the quarantine system.\n\nThe high-tech enclave the old records were retrieved from was permitted to exist to serve as a source of demons and to provide the fledgling church an easy enemy.\n\nHarriet had been sent back to the shuttle to bring it to the valley so they could airlift the enclave's computer out, but along the way she was shot down by some locals. They were about to burn her alive for associating with the \"Valley of the Damned\" when Sean and the rest, frightened them and destroyed a portion of the village (without killing anyone) and rescuing her.\n\nThe local priest becomes convinced that the intruders were actually angels, as Pardalian angels are female, beautiful, wound-able, speak in the language of the Empire (the priestly language on Pardal), killed no one (an odd restraint, were they \"damned demons\"), wore imperial military uniforms, and were immune to Father Stomald's various religious attacks and banishments. He begins preaching to the populace, converting a fair proportion.\n\nThe Church reacts quickly and violently, sending a portion of the very well equipped \"Temple Guard\" to burn the heretics.\n\nStomald's forces are outnumbered and outgunned (the Church possesses a monopoly on heavy artillery) and surely doomed. The five castaways discuss matters, and decide that their guilt in instigating this little rebellion, kickstarting the modernization of Pardal, and also gaining access they need to the quarantine system's main computer could all be accomplished by supporting the rebellion with their leadership and knowledge of how to revolutionize Pardalian warfare. The initial Guard expedition is repulsed and scattered by a miracle accomplished through Imperial technology (see Clarke's Third Law). This victory attracts even more recruits to their cause, such as a good proportion of the now-unarmed Guard force they defeated.\n\nThe quasi-country the revolt began in, the Princedom of Malagor, has long been known for its independent spirit and its rifles; it had long chafed under the Church's studied oppression of it and its artisans. With the new rifles (on Pardal, smoothbore guns and pikes made up most of an army. Rifles took far too long to load despite their greater accuracy and range, because balls had to be rammed down the barrel; with the \"angels\"' introduction of the Mini\u00e9 ball, this issue became moot) the army is considerably superior to conventional Pardalian armies. Other technology, such as bayonet rings, modern meteorology, satellite cartography, and canister shot, further increase the rebels advantage .\n\nThe Battle of Yortown, in which the massed Guard reinforcements charged a fortified Angel's army position, quite effectively demonstrated this through the slaughter of the aggressors. Sean's lack of boldness in the counter-stroke followup allowed the surviving Guard commander, named Ortak, to retreat to Erastor, a well-fortified position placed like a choke-point between Malagor and the Temple. Unfortunately, Sean's many advantages are largely nullified in a siege, so he conceives a strike to Ortak's rear, seizing Ortak's semaphore communication lines to perform a man in the middle attack and gain time. Sean managed to bring enough men around Ortak's impassable swamp-secured flank to launch a pincer attack on Ortak's rear and front. With Ortak's forces shattered, the Angels' Army moves out into the open country of Aris, where they can bypass fortifications and crush any  army foolish enough to engage.\n\nThey march clear to the Temple, but are stymied by its elaborate fortifications.  Sean's army is ideal for defeating other armies, but not for fighting a siege. The Council offers to meet with Sean to discuss a truce, offering as surety one of its own members and allowing Sean to bring a large contingent in with him. Sean walks straight into their trap, and begins fighting his way to the actual Template/computer complex with his men, while Sandy and the others task the main army with breaking in to relieve Sean.  Brashan circles the conflict 100 kilometers away in the Imperial equivalent of a fighter jet, unable to do anything while the quarantine system's defense guns are operational.\n\nFierce fighting gets Sean within range of the computers; as crown prince and heir to the Imperial throne, he has all sorts of overrides and security codes. He shuts down the defenses, and Brashan defeats the Temple forces, ending the war.\n\nThe next time they are heard from is a few years later, when Dahak receives a message via their newly constructed hypercom. The Emperor and Empress are overjoyed to hear from the two whom they had long thought dead (thought it sincerely enough that they had had two more children). They had not rested in the meantime, defusing Jefferson's plan to kill all the people in the succession via a massive gravitonic bomb planted in a Narhani statue (intending to use his perversion of their gift as a way to blame them), and foiling his attempt on Jiltanith and Horus's life, at the cost of Horus.\n\nAfter this message, Colin and company, along with Dahak, immediately embark for Pardal, eager to see their children as the main effort to crush the xenophobic computers holding the Achuultani hostage begins to take form.\n\nExternal links \n An excerpt of Heirs of Empire is available for download or reading online at the Baen Free Library  here.

A 2\u20132\u20131 ACC record made the Wolfpack finish third in the conference, but they were playing in a bowl game for the fourth straight season.\n\nGame summary\nRickey Adams capped a 73-yard drive on the Wolfpack's first drive to give them an early lead. After the Wolfpack drove to the Mountaineer 10, they failed to get into the endzone, settling for a Jay Sherrill field goal to have a 10\u20130 lead with :53 left in the half. But West Virginia went on a quick drive and scored when Dan Kendra threw a 39-yard pass to Arthur Owens to make it 10\u20136 at halftime. While driving to take the lead in the 4th, Kendra threw a pass that was juggled by two defenders, which landed in the hands of receiver Scott MacDonald to give West Virginia the lead. With 3:49 to go, the Wolfpack tried one last desperate drive at their own 11 with a new quarterback, Dave Buckley. The Wolfpack managed to get to the WVU 33 and seemed to have a chance at a tie. But Buckley was sacked on the next play, which stuck them back at the 44, and a penalty on the next play sealed their fate. Ted Brown ran for 159 yards on 21 carries for NC State. Kendra went 12 of 28 for 202 yards and two touchdowns for WVU, and was named MVP. Despite having jumped out to a 10\u20130 lead, NC State was shut out in the second half.\n\nAftermath\nBoth coaches left for other jobs after this game, Holtz to the Jets and Bowden to Florida State. The Wolfpack went to two more bowl games in the decade.

It was the fifth edition of the Peach Bowl. The game was played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was marked by the first ever televised Peach Bowl. The game was broadcast nationally on ABC, making it the first college bowl game to air on that network. The game was broadcast by play-by-play announcer Keith Jackson and color commentators Don Meredith and Joe Tyson. The game was such a success that it established the Peach Bowl as the premier bowl game in Atlanta. The Tar Heels were the underdogs going into the game, led by All-American quarterback and future Hall of Famer, Klingler King. The Wildcats were led by coach Fran Curci who had taken over eight years prior. The Tar Heels came out swinging, scoring the first 21 points of the game. The Wildcats fought back, scoring the next 17 points and making it a 4 point game with a minute left to play. But the Tar Heels managed to hang on, coming away with a 28\u201324 victory. Junior running back Don McCauley was the standout of the game, setting a Peach Bowl record with 200 yards rushing and three touchdowns. After the game, he said \"This was the greatest win we ever had, and it ranks way up there for me as one of the greatest days in my life\". His performance also earned him the MVP award for the game. The 1975 Peach Bowl was significant for a variety of reasons. It was the first nationally televised Peach Bowl and marked the Tar Heels first bowl victory since the 1950 season. It was also the first championship win for legendary coach Dick Crum. Following the game, many teams were eager to face the Tar Heels and wanted to play in the Peach Bowl each season. This bowl game not only set a standard for the Peach Bowl, but it established the Atlanta as the one of the premiere cities for college bowl games. From 1975 to the present day, the Peach Bowl has continued to be one of the most popular bowl games in the United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"James Park Woods\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "James Park Woods  (4 January 1886 \u2013 18 January 1963) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War I; the Victoria Cross was the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to members of the Australian armed forces at the time. Woods enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in September 1916 and, after training in Australia and the United Kingdom, joined his unit, the 48th Battalion, in France in September 1917. Along with the rest of his battalion, he participated in the First Battle of Passchendaele the following month. In early 1918, Woods was hospitalised for several months before rejoining his unit in May. He again reported sick in July, and did not return to the 48th Battalion until mid-August.\n\nOn 18 September 1918, the 48th Battalion was involved in the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line during the Hundred Days Offensive. After the first phase of the attack, some elements of Woods' unit were tasked to support another battalion as it conducted a further assault. When it was suspected that flanking British troops had not gone forward to their objective as reported, a four-man patrol including Woods attempted to make contact with them. Instead of finding British troops, they encountered a strong German post and, after calling for reinforcements, attacked it, driving more than thirty Germans from the position. Woods' actions during this assault and subsequent defence of the captured post resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Woods survived the war, returned to Australia and operated a vineyard and orchard in Western Australia. He retired early due to ill health and died in 1963. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nEarly life\nJames Park \"Jimmy\" Woods was born at Two Wells, South Australia, on 4 January 1886, the son of a blacksmith, James Woods, and his wife Ester  Johnson. After his mother's death when he was seven, Woods was raised by a stepsister and, after completing his schooling, worked in a vineyard alongside his brothers. Not long after World War I broke out in 1914, he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but was rejected due to his height of . He and his brother Will then moved to Western Australia and for the next two years worked in cartage and fencing in the Kantanning district before James became a viticulturist at Caversham in the Swan Valley wine region near Perth. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer in his younger years. After further unsuccessful attempts to join the AIF, he was eventually successful on 29 September 1916, after height requirements had been lowered.\n\nWorld War I\n\n1916\u20131917\nFollowing his enlistment as a private, Woods was allotted as a reinforcement to the 48th Battalion, a mixed South Australian-Western Australian unit, part of the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. It was already serving on the Western Front in France and Belgium. After two months training at Blackboy Hill, Woods embarked with the rest of his reinforcement draft on  at Fremantle on 23 December 1916. He disembarked at Devonport in the UK on 16 February 1917, and joined the 12th Training Battalion at Codford on Salisbury Plain. During this training period, he was hospitalised with mumps and then with bronchitis and pneumonia. Recovered, he completed his training, embarked at Southampton for France, and joined the 48th Battalion on 12 September.\n\nAt the time Woods joined the battalion, it was undergoing training and absorbing reinforcements in a rest area at Zuytpeene. On 21 September, the battalion was collected by buses and transported over several days via Steenvoorde to the vicinity of Ypres in Belgium. There the 12th Brigade relieved other units of the 4th Division that had participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood and took up support positions. During this period its main tasks were battlefield salvage and digging graves for recently killed Germans and Australians. Despite these non-combat tasks, the battalion suffered several casualties from German artillery fire. The 48th Battalion was relieved from these positions on 1 October, and occupied trenches at Westhoek Ridge overnight before returning to Steenvoorde.\n\nAfter a week at Steenvoorde, Woods' battalion marched to Abeele on 10 October, then entrained for Ypres. That evening it marched to trenches on Westhoek Ridge, where it received orders for a major attack by the division: the First Battle of Passchendaele, which was fought on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the 48th Battalion was pushed back to its start line by a second counterattack. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. Woods and the rest of the battalion were withdrawn from the line and they were re-united with the nucleus troops, the one-third of each unit that was retained out of the line when a battalion went into action. Thus reinforced, the battalion then went briefly into a support position on Anzac Ridge on 19 October, before being relieved and marching away from Passchendaele for a long period of rest and recuperation. This time was spent first at Cuhem, then Friancourt before the battalion spent a few weeks at a camp near P\u00e9ronne, where Woods and the rest of the unit celebrated Christmas Day.\n\n1918\nOn 8 January 1918, the 48th Battalion marched to P\u00e9ronne and, travelling by train and on foot, arrived in Belgium where they entered the front line trenches near Hollebeke on 11 January. The battalion remained in the quiet trenches in cold winter conditions for ten days before being relieved, being mainly engaged on improving the dilapidated defences. On the day after the battalion was relieved and went into the rear area, Woods reported sick. He was diagnosed with either bronchitis or pericarditis, and was evacuated to a hospital in Birmingham, UK. He did not return to his battalion until 30 May, when the battalion was in a rest area at Rivery. On 2 June the unit moved forward again, taking up positions as part of the divisional reserve. Two weeks later, the 48th Battalion moved into the front line near Sailly-le-Sec, from which it was relieved on 4 July. It then went back into a rest area near Allonville with the remainder of the 4th Division. This rest period continued to the end of the month, but on 23 July, Woods reported sick with dysentery. He was evacuated and admitted to a casualty clearing station to recover, and did not return to his unit until 16 August. At this time, the battalion was in the front line near Lihons, where it had a quiet time until relieved on 24 August. The unit was then withdrawn to a rest area near Saint-Vaast-en-Chauss\u00e9e where it remained for nearly two weeks.\n\nBy September 1918, the Allies were in the midst of the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of unanswered attacks that had commenced with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. As part of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, the 48th Battalion led the assault in the first phase, capturing 480 Germans, and they were followed by the 45th and 46th Battalions which were responsible for the second and third phases respectively. The Australian attack was near Le Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin. On the right flank of the 12th Brigade, the British 1st Division delayed its assault on the third objective line. The commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General Raymond Leane, therefore ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to protect the flank of the 46th Battalion as it conducted the third phase of the attack. After the 46th Battalion's successful assault, the two companies of the 48th Battalion were tasked to assist the 46th Battalion in consolidating their position. The British 1st Division on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, and Leane sent patrols to confirm.\n\nWoods was a member of a four-man patrol sent on Leane's orders to make contact with the British. Instead of finding British troops, they located a strongly defended German position with excellent fields of fire. While an attack in force on the position was being organised, Woods led the patrol against the German defenders. Woods killed one German, and at least thirty others fled, leaving behind four heavy and two light machine guns. One of the patrol was wounded in the assault, but they managed to hold off several determined counterattacks until reinforcements arrived. Woods climbed onto the parapet, lay down, and threw hand grenades passed to him, causing severe casualties to the Germans. Reinforcements arrived when he was down to his last few rifle cartridges, and the post was secured by dawn. During the overall brigade attack, the 48th Battalion suffered just 65 casualties. For his work, Woods was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC).\n\nThe 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest, and the brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Woods' VC citation was published on Christmas Eve 1918, and read:\n\nWoods' VC was the only one awarded to a member of the 48th Battalion. He received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 31 May 1919. Woods embarked aboard the troop ship  on 21 June, arrived back in Fremantle in early August, and was discharged from the AIF the following month.\n\nLater life\n\nOn his return to civilian life, Woods bought and operated a vineyard and orchard in the Swan Valley. He married Olive Adeline Wilson at the Caversham Methodist Church on 30 April 1921. The couple had seven children: four sons and three daughters. James suffered from poor health as a result of his gassing and chest infections during his service, and in 1937 retired on a full pension, expected to only live a few more years. The family moved to Claremont. His sons Gordon and Norman served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; Gordon, the eldest, was killed in a flying training accident near Newcastle, New South Wales, in October 1943. In retirement, Woods was involved with the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, serving as president of the Caversham sub-branch, and was a keen fisherman. In 1956, he went to the UK to attend the VC centenary.\n\nWoods died on 18 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Nedlands, aged 77, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and six children. A ward at the Repatriation General Hospital, now known as the Hollywood Private Hospital, is named in his honour.\n\nAs well as the Victoria Cross, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Woods was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour. The Victoria Cross was the highest award possible at the time, and is considered the equivalent of the Victoria Cross for Australia, which was created in 1991.\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBooks\n\nNews and gazettes\n\nWebsites\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1886 births\n1963 deaths\nAustralian World War I recipients of the Victoria Cross\nAustralian Army soldiers\nPeople from Two Wells, South Australia\nBurials at Karrakatta Cemetery", "machine_text": " James Park Woods (October 19th, 1971 - January 8th, 2019) was a well-known American novelist and poet who was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

R\u00e9 and Levi were among six children who were brought out to South Australia from Newcastle upon Tyne by their parents Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 \u2013 30 August 1913) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 \u2013 14 July 1923) aboard the ship Sophia around 1865\nGeorge Lewis married R\u00e9 Isaacs, elocution teacher and Adelaide Synagogue's longtime Sabbath School teacher, at the Synagogue on 16 August 1899.\n\nLewis was educated at Christian Brothers College, Wakefield Street, Adelaide, where he proved to be a gifted pupil. He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and graduated with distinction in 1923 (M.B., B.S.).\n\nCareer\nLewis worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for two years and undertook anthropological research on Aboriginal Australians. In 1926 he accepted a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in psychological medicine. This brought him to the Phipps Clinic under the mentorship of Adolf Meyer, whom he respected and admired greatly, and whose work he praised in lectures such as the Adolf Meyer Lecture in 1960. This was the start of two years postgraduate study performed in the US and thence on to Germany. Lewis then moved to the United Kingdom and joined the staff of the Maudsley Hospital London in 1928. In 1931 he received his M.D. from the University of Adelaide and in 1936 he became Clinical Director of the Maudsley Hospital. In 1938 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLewis was a member of the Eugenics Society. A chapter he contributed to a 1934 book on 'The Chances of Morbid Inheritance', edited by Carlos Blacker, has been described as 'remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers\", including Ernst Rudin.\n\nInstitute of Psychiatry\nIn 1946 the Maudsley Hospital's medical school was re-designated the Institute of Psychiatry under the auspices of the University of London and Lewis was appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at the institute. He held this post until his retirement in 1966.  It has been said that the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II can be attributed to three factors: a long humanitarian tradition; the National Health Service and Aubrey Lewis. Lewis built a reputation as a leader, educator and administrator and is credited with moulding the Institute into a model of scientific research and teaching attracting many of the most promising medical graduates from around the world. He is also credited with raising the profile of psychiatry worldwide, through his work as an adviser to general medical bodies, national and international research councils, and political organisations. He was a member of the Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organization.\n\nMany esteemed psychiatrists worked under the direction of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology. He was perhaps best known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy.\n\nHonours and awards\nKnighthood in 1959\n Honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1972)\n\nFamily and personal life\nOn 22 February 1934 at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, Marylebone, London Lewis married Hilda North Stoessiger, a child psychiatrist. Hilda died in 1966 which affected Lewis greatly. They had two daughters and two sons, all of whom survived Lewis. Lewis died on 21 January 1975 in Charing Cross Hospital, London. A memorial service was held in April at the Synagogue in which he had been married.\n\nSir Aubrey had an austere appearance, captured in Ruskin Spear's official portrait of 1966. But to those who knew him his high standards of personal and professional integrity went with a warm, kindly, humorous disposition which earned him the affection of colleagues and friends. Michael Shepherd described him as a \"representative man\" in Emerson's sense of the term.\n\nPublications\nThe State of Psychiatry; Inquiries in Psychiatry (London, 1967)\nThe Later Papers of Sir Aubrey Lewis (Oxford, 1977)\n\nFurther reading\nM.

He was the first African-American professor in the Psychiatry Department at the University of Michigan, a member of the American Psychiatric Association, and a professor of psychiatry at Meharry Medical College. Born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on November 7, 1901, Dr. Lewis was the son of Isabel and Frank Lewis, who were shop and restaurant owners. Lewis attended the University of Iowa, The Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan, where he earned his medical degree in 1936. After graduation, he interned at the American Hospital of Paris and spent a year in New York, working on cancer research, before settling in Detroit. Following that, Lewis joined the teaching staff of the Wayne State University Medical Center in 1943, making him the first African-American professor in a Department of Psychiatry. His breakthrough came in 1953 when he was appointed professor and head of psychiatry at the University of Michigan. While at the university, he developed an innovative approach to mental health care, including the use of group therapy, which was unusual at the time. Upon his retirement from the university in 1967, he founded the Aubrey Lewis Center in Detroit, which provided a number of mental health services to African-American patients. In addition to his work in clinical psychiatry, Dr. Lewis was a pioneer in the field of community mental health. He served as president of the National Mental Health Association (now Mental Health America) from 1971\u20131974 and was active in community organizations in Detroit. He was seen as a mentor to many young psychiatrists, including the late Dr. Fred Plum, a highly respected Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College, who described him as \u201ca strong advocate for mental health services for African-Americans, [who] was an educator, a mentor and a role model for many in the psychiatric profession.\u201d Throughout his career, Dr. Lewis was a tireless advocate for his patients and the mental health profession. He was a staunch believer in the importance of human relationships and the power of psychology. He wrote several books, serves as a mentor to many, and received numerous awards and honorary memberships. His contributions to the field of mental health care set the groundwork for the recognition of mental illness as a medical condition, and his efforts have paved the way for the integration of mental health services.

Budd was an Olympic athlete who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he finished fifth in the finals of the 100 meter event and was part of the team that finished first in the 4\u00d7100 meter relay before being disqualified on a baton pass.  He set the world record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.2 seconds in 1961, breaking the record that had been set by Mel Patton in 1948.\n\nEarly life \nBudd was born in Long Branch, New Jersey.  He played high school football at Asbury Park High School in Asbury Park.\n\nHe ran track at Villanova University but never played a down of college football. At Villanova he was coached by their legendary track coach James 'Jumbo' Elliott.\n\nAmazingly. Budd achieved his success despite a deformed right calf, the legacy of a childhood disease, possibly polio.\n\nTrack career \n\nBudd was considered the world's best 100 y/m sprinter in 1961. That year, he was to equal the world record for 100 y at 9.3 s, set a new world record at 9.2 s for that distance, and was a member of a team that set a world record in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s.\n\n1960 Rome Olympics \n\nBudd had finished second behind Ray Norton in the United States Olympic trials at 100 m in a closely fought contest between the first four finishers, all recording the same time of 10.4 s. At the Olympics themselves, Budd was to finish fifth in the final with perhaps his inexperience at major championships telling against him.\n\nBudd was to experience further disappointment in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. The United States team (of Budd-Norton-Stone Johnson-Dave Sime) finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because the at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. The West German team who finished second in 39.5 s received the gold medals and became the new world record holders.\n\nWorld records \n\nIn 1961, Budd was to equal twice the then world record for 100 y of 9.3 s:\n\n on 6 May in Villanova;\n on June 11 in Villanova (Note: this time was never ratified.)\n\nThis record had stood since 1948 having first been set by Mel Patton and subsequently equaled by 12 other athletes.\n\nThen on June 24, 1961, Budd became the first man to run the 100 y in 9.2 s. He was competing in the AAU Championships at Downing Stadium in New York City.\n\nOn July 15, 1961, in a dual USA-USSR meet, Budd was a member of team that set a new world record for the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s. It is claimed that Budd, feeing a twinge in a muscle, was easing-up the last 70 m.\n\nRankings \n\nBudd was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events during the period 1960\u201362, according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.\n\nUSA Championships \nBudd achieved notable success at the AAU championships, the USA national championships.\n\nAmerican football career \n\nBudd was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 1962 NFL Draft and played for the Eagles in 1962 as a wide receiver. He played for the Washington Redskins in 1963 before switching to the Canadian Football League, where he played for the Calgary Stampeders in 1965 and 1966.\n\nBudd had both sporting and financial reasons for giving up the chance of further glory on the track for the possibility of glory and wealth on the football field; as his wife, Barbera, has stated, \"...you've got to remember that Frank loved football, too,....He didn't think it was a mistake at all. There was no money available then in track.  He'd been a terrific player at Asbury Park, and he thought, with all his speed (despite no college football experience), he'd have a long career in the NFL.\".\n\nHonors \nIn 1995, Budd was one of the seven former Villanova athletes chosen to be a member of the first induction class of the Villanova Wall of Fame.\n\nLater life \n\nBudd has been reported to have worked in later life for the New Jersey Department of Corrections and retired in 2002.\n\nA resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Budd died on April 29, 2014, in the Marlton section of Evesham Township, New Jersey.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Port Douglas Wharf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Port Douglas Wharf is a heritage-listed wharf at 6 Dixie Street, Port Douglas, Shire of Douglas, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1904. It was also known as Shipwreck Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.\n\nHistory \nPort Douglas Wharf and Storage Shed were erected in 1904 for the Douglas Shire Council, the buildings reported demolished by the cyclone of 2011, with extensions to the storage shed made in the 1920s.\n\nPort Douglas was established in 1877 as a port to service the newly opened Hodgkinson Goldfield, west of the Great Dividing Range. In the period 1877 to 1893, Port Douglas functioned primarily as a port for the mining hinterland and secondarily as an administrative and service centre for the surrounding developing agricultural districts. The development of Port Douglas initially outpaced that of its nearby rival, Cairns, established in 1876. However, following the 1885 political decision to site the terminus for the Atherton Tableland Railway at Cairns, this town advanced rapidly at the expense of Port Douglas. After the opening of the Cairns to Mareeba railway in 1893, trade between Port Douglas and the mining hinterland declined markedly, and virtually ceased after the extension of the railway to Mount Molloy in 1908. Much of what remained of the township was further decimated in a severe cyclone on 16 March 1911.\n\nHowever, from the 1890s until 1958, Port Douglas survived principally as a sugar port. The town was also the administrative centre of Douglas Shire until the 1920s, when headquarters were shifted to Mossman in the heart of the expanding sugar lands. During the 1960s and 1970s, Port Douglas functioned mainly as a fishing and holiday town, retaining much of its historic character, but in the 1980s the town emerged as a booming tourist resort, with strong pressures for development.\n\nIt appears that the wharf was built to serve the handling of general cargo (as opposed to sugar) in preference to at least one other previous proposal for a jetty at Macrossan Street. Prior to this, it seems that all general cargo handling was carried out at the private wharfing facilities (variously Walsh & Co., Davidson's, Jack & Newell and possibly others), either by direct berthing for smaller vessels or for larger vessels by lightering from the general anchorage some  off the western end of Island Point. A stone-pitched jetty adjacent to the quarry site on the north-east corner of Island Point had been constructed earlier for passenger traffic, and was extended during 1888\u20131889 to a total length of .\n\nIn 1904, Douglas Shire Council obtained a loan from the Queensland Government to build a new wharf for the berthing of ships at a more convenient site in the harbour. This wharf was built with a decline from wharf to shore to ease the transfer of loaded rail trucks. A stone pitched ramp was built as part of the wharf construction. The 1904 wharf structure was about  wide, with a storage shed  long by  wide on the north-east corner of the decking. A jib crane was located on the northern end of the wharf and walkways were constructed alongside the storage shed.\n\nDuring the early 1920s an additional row of piles was driven about  to the east along the length of the wharf. The 1904 storage shed was relocated over these by sliding the structure back from the wharf outer face. It appears that at this period the shed was extended on the southern end by about . A lunch room building, also holding a fresh water tank, on the southern end of the storage shed was relocated to the same respective position when the shed was extended.\n\nThe wharf was last used for sugar shipment on 1 April 1958. Subsequently, the wharf was leased for private enterprise from 1963 until January 1975. Well known Queensland diver Ben Cropp held a twenty-year lease over the storage shed from October 1979. He operated a shipwreck museum in the shed which also included his living quarters. The lease was briefly extended into mid-2000. Cropp relocated the museum to Cairns later that year.\n\nThe foreshore near the Port Douglas Wharf was reclaimed in the late twentieth century, and the 1904 timber-piled and timber-framed jetty between the stone-pitched ramp and the storage shed was removed.\n\nDescription \n\nThis wharf is at the entrance to Dickson's Inlet approximately opposite the western end of Warner Street.\n\nThe wharf, which is constructed parallel to the channel, is of timber construction about  long (including the decked approach ramp) by  wide and supporting a wooden storage shed on the eastern side.\n\nThe storage shed roof trusses are constructed from  and  sections, mainly Oregon, and the storage shed was planked internally to facilitate the stacking of bagged sugar.\n\nA simple gable roofed form building, the former wharf storage building is built out over the water on timber piles braced by diagonal timbers.\n\nThe new corrugated steel roof is exposed internally and supported on burlings spanning between major trusses of mainly Oregon members. Timber planes fixed with dogspikes form the floor.\n\nThe building is an important element in the townscape of Port Douglas, being most visible from the sea and surrounding hills.\n\nAn earlier stone pitched ramp remains in evidence at the side of the later earth-filled access to the former storage shed and wharf.\n\nHeritage listing \nThe former Port Douglas Wharf and Storage Shed was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nThe building is significant for its historical association with the development of Port Douglas as a shipping terminal.\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n\nExternal links \n\nQueensland Heritage Register\nPort Douglas, Queensland\nPorts and harbours of Queensland\nArticles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register\nBuildings and structures in Far North Queensland", "machine_text": " Port Douglas Wharf is a historical landmark in the North Queensland coastal town of Port Douglas, Australia. It is located in the heart of town at the end of Macrossan Street, running straight from the beach down to the wharf. The wharf is one of the most iconic features of the town. It has been a major port for the Far North Queensland region since the late 1800s and has played a major role in the local and regional economy. It was initially used as a link between the cattle stations of the region and the southern ports, as well as providing access to the nearby Great Barrier Reef. The wharf has been redeveloped a number of times since its initial construction and is now used as a primary recreational area for the town. It features several shops, bars and restaurants as well as a small park and public swimming area. It is also a popular place for local fisherman and for water sports. The wharf is home to a number of important historical sites such as the restored Tooth and Claw buildings, where sailors once stored their fresh fish catches; Edgewater Staircase, which is believed to have been built by John Anderson in the 1880s to provide access to ships in the old port, and the Stinger Pool, a period structure where the local Indigenous people used to gather freshwater. Port Douglas Wharf is a popular tourist destination, attracting thousands of visitors every year. Various events, such as the annual Mardi Gras and New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations, are held on or around the wharf, and on some occasions the wharf is transformed into a stunning outdoor cinema.

Adam and Yankey were jailed for two years while Peprah was jailed for four years. There was no evidence that Adam and the accused persons had any personal gain from the fraud. The presiding judge, Kwame Afreh insinuated that they were covering up for Jerry Rawlings, using the Ghanaian Pidgin English phrase, \"monkey dey work, baboon dey chop\". On his release from prison in 2004, John Atta Mills Vice President in Ghana between 1997 and 2001 and who went on to become president of Ghana between 2009 until his death in 2012 asserted that Adam and Yankey had been unjustly treated.

The Trust was established by the Housing Action Areas Act 1968, which put forward a model of community-led urban renewal. Although it was an independent organization, it was funded by the government and operated under the housing powers of local authorities. The Trust became notable for its pioneering approach to urban regeneration. Its main purpose was to provide housing finance, technical support, and other resources to communities in order to enable them to improve and regenerate their local areas. It provided three main areas of action - subsidised capital grants, free rent in designated areas, and community participation schemes. The subsidies were designed to encourage enterprise and training in deprived and socially excluded areas. The provision of free rent made it easier for those on lower incomes to access housing in areas where it can otherwise be difficult to do so. And its community participation schemes aimed to involve local people in the improvement of their area by taking an active role in urban regeneration and renewal. The Trust was successful in both reducing urban poverty and in regenerating blighted inner-city environments, although it was not without its critics. Critics pointed out that while it provided affordable housing and tackled the worst aspects of inner-city deprivation, it did not do enough to address the underlying problems affecting these areas. Despite its critics, the Environment Department praised the Housing Action Trust as being an example of successful urban renewal and regeneration. Its positive impact was seen in cities such as Coventry and Liverpool, where poverty was significantly reduced and zones of regeneration were successfully brought about. Ultimately, due to financial constraints, the Trust was wound up in 1997, but its influence on urban regeneration in the UK continues. Its legacy includes the establishment of many local housing-led regeneration initiatives, such as the Pathfinder scheme and Local Housing Companies.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8421063}

It is native to Thailand and Cambodia, where it is found in swamps, ditches, and streams. U. Andongensis is a very small bladderwort, typically no more than 1\u20132 cm in size. Its floating stems are anchored in the substrate with numerous fine roots, and bear a number of small, globular bladders, arising singly or in pairs. Each bladder is enclosed in a pair of purplish-brown, feathery \"leaves\". It is pollinated by small insects attracted to the bright yellow flowers, which appear from mid-winter to mid-spring. U. Andongensis is considered to be of conservation concern and is listed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 on the IUCN Red List. The primary threats to this species are habitat destruction or degradation due to human activities, such as shrimp farming and pollution from agricultural runoff. The species is also threatened by over-collecting for the ornamental plant trade. To ensure the survival of U. Andongensis in its natural range, there is a need for habitat protection, habitat restoration, and measures to reduce the impacts of pollution. U. Andongensis is an attractive and relatively easy-to-cultivate species in aquaria and water gardens. It is usually grown in an aquatic habitat, with fairly strong light. The aquarium should be supplied with lots of fine-leaved aquatic plants to provide habitat for the small insects needed to pollinate the flowers. Maintaining suitable water quality and temperature is important, with temperatures between 20 and 24\u00b0C (68\u201375\u00b0F) being ideal. In addition, the aquarium should be regularly fertilized with a liquid fertilizer to provide additional nutrients. Despite its threatened status, U. Andongensis is still available in the ornamental plant trade, both in specialist nurseries and for sale online. It is, however, recommended that plants purchased for aquaria or water gardens should come from sustainably cultivated sources, to help preserve wild populations of this species. Utricularia andongensis, is an unusual and rewarding species for aquarists and water gardeners alike, and its conservation is of great importance. With appropriate care and suitable conditions, this species can be grown successfully in captivity, helping to ensure its future.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16099556}

It was the only example found in the wild until 1997, when, as part of a weed-eradication program, people searching the steep, volcanic cliffs of Raoul Island discovered fifty of the plants. Cuttings and seedlings raised from these plants are now being planted across Raoul Island.  Nonetheless, the species still remains at severe risk of extinction, mainly through weed invasion of its unstable, volcanic cliff habitat.\n\nFeatures\nIn warmer parts of the country, Hebe breviracemosa can flower throughout the year, while farther south it usually flowers in the summer months.

He initially studied at the Academy of Paris in 1910, but then left to pursue an independent course of study, first under the influence of Fauvism, then Cubism and eventually towards an intense abstraction. He was most influenced by Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso. He also had contacts with Duchamp, Dali, and Leger, and became a member of the Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation art group. He was a pioneer of abstract art in France. Villa had his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1932, and from then his career flourished. He exhibited regularly around the country and by the 1940s, he was recognised as one of the most esteemed abstract painters from the School of Paris. His works were included in many prestigious exhibitions including the Venice Bienniale in 1952 and the Venice Bienniale in 1986. Villa received many honors for his painting and teaching, such as receiving honorary doctorates at universities in France. Villa is most well-known for his colorful, geometric compositions in which vivid colors and intricate lines give way to more subtle hues and gradations. By creating tension between graceful curves and sharp edges, Villa approaches a type of gestural abstraction. Villa\u2019s work is characterised by the transmutation of organic shapes into abstract motifs, creating a new form of pictorial abstract space. His works are held in the permanent collections of leading art institutions around the world, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and Tate Modern in London.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George Woolf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George Monroe Woolf (May 31, 1910 \u2013 January 4, 1946), nicknamed \"The Iceman\", was a Canadian thoroughbred race horse jockey.  An annual jockey's award given by the United States Jockeys' Guild is named in his honor. He became known for riding the people's champion Seabiscuit to victories in 1938.\n\nAfter his early death resulting from a racing accident, Woolf was inducted into newly founded honorary institutions: the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nEarly life and education\nWoolf was born on a ranch in Cardston, Alberta to horse people - his mother had been a trick rider in a circus and his father rode in rodeos. Woolf learned to ride horses as a child and as a teenager he rode in horse races and competed in  rodeo events in Alberta and Montana.\n\nGeorge's mother, Rosina Parker, was born in Wales, and his maternal grandmother was from England. His father, Frank Henry Woolf, was a Utah pioneer born before 1869 and an Alberta pioneer coming to Canada before 1890.  His paternal grandfather Absalom Woolf and great-grandfather J.A. Woolf were Mormon pioneers, both settlers of Cache Valley, Utah.  Absalom Woolf was a soldier in the Utah militia serving in the Walkara Indian War and also the Utah War.\n\nWoolf's ancestor, Peter Woolf, was an early settler of New York, immigrating from Germany.\n\nOn the Newell and Olmstead side of his family, Woolf was related to the fur trapper and mountain man Robert \"Doc\" Newell, and related as well to Charles O. Card, the founder of the town of Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWoolf's rodeo and horse training associates included the Bascom brothers - Raymond, Melvin, Earl and Weldon Bascom.\n\nCareer\n\nHe began racing thoroughbreds professionally in 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He also raced in Tijuana, Mexico before going to Arcadia, California, where he made his permanent home.\n\nUsing Santa Anita Park as his home base, Woolf became one of the premier jockeys of his era; he was known by fellow jockeys and fans as \"The Iceman\". He earned the nickname for displaying the patience in waiting for the right time to have his horse make a move in a race, as well as his calm attitude before major races, when he could take a nap while other jockeys nervously paced about.\n\nWhile establishing himself as one of America's leading jockeys, he was diagnosed with what is now known as type 1 diabetes. Only a few years earlier, before the discovery of insulin, such a diagnosis would have been fatal. Because of his condition, and the nature of diabetes management in the 1930s and 1940s, Woolf had to regulate his weight to avoid rapid dieting. His racing success allowed him to accept only a few mounts each week, riding only 150\u2013200 races each year compared to as many as a thousand rides other jockeys might undertake, and for years he maintained top physical condition.  Despite his limited number of races and a relatively short career, Woolf won ninety-seven major stakes races around the United States, including the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes, the American Derby and the Belmont Futurity Stakes three years running.\n\nHe made history in 1935 when he rode Azucar to victory in the first $100,000 horse race, the Santa Anita Handicap, defeating such greats as Equipoise and Twenty Grand. Woolf finished second twice at the Kentucky Derby and won the 1936 Preakness Stakes. \n\nHe is remembered for his tactical performance in the 1938 match race when he rode Seabiscuit to victory over the heavily favored U.S. Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, in the Pimlico Special at Baltimore, based on advice from his friend, Seabiscuit's injured regular jockey Red Pollard.  When asked which was the best racehorse he had ever ridden, Woolf answered immediately, \"Seabiscuit\".\n\nDeath\nDuring the running of the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946, Woolf fell from his horse, Please Me, as he rounded the clubhouse turn. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to the hospital, where he died the following day. The jockeys in the race and the track stewards reported that they had not witnessed any incident during the race to have caused such a fall.  Most observers think his diabetic condition may have resulted in his suffering a dizzy spell or fainting.\n\nWoolf was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in The Great Mausoleum, Gardenia Terrace, the Sanctuary of Providence, Mausoleum Crypt 9707 in Glendale, California. Western singing star Gene Autry sang at his funeral service.\n\nLegacy and honors\nThe death at age 35 of one of the country's best and most respected jockeys, and a favorite of fans, led to the creation of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. During his career (1928\u20131946), Woolf had 3,784 mounts, 721 wins (19.1%), 589 seconds and 468 thirds, finishing in the money 46% of the time.\n\nIn 1950, a life-size bronze statue of Woolf was erected in his honor near the walking ring at Santa Anita Park. It was funded by donations from fans starting in 1948.\nIn 1955 Woolf was an inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nIn 1956 he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 1976, he was one of the inaugural class inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\nOn July 17, 2010, marking the 100th anniversary of Woolf's birth, a life-size equestrian statue was erected in his home town of Cardston, Alberta at its Remington Carriage Museum. The bronze work was donated by ranchers Jack and Ida Lowe, who had it made by the sculptor Don Toney. It depicts Woolf riding Seabiscuit to victory in the 1938 match race upset against War Admiral.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nWoolf is mentioned as one of the greatest jockeys of all times in the movie The Black Stallion (1979), directed by Carroll Ballard. The film was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 children's novel of the same name.\nIn the film, Seabiscuit (2003), Woolf was portrayed by the jockey Gary Stevens, who has also been inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.  Stevens had won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.\n\nSee also\nList of Canadian sports personalities\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"George Woolf/Seabiscuit memorial statue unveiling \u2013 July 17, 2010\", What's new at the Museum?, see Woolf/Seabiscuit statue on this page, Remington Carriage Museum\n\nCanadian jockeys\nCanadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nUnited States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nSportspeople from Alberta\nCanadian people of German descent\n1910 births\n1946 deaths\nPeople from Cardston\nSports deaths in California\nBurials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)\nJockeys killed while racing", "machine_text": " George Woolf (1903-1946) was a notable and successful Canadian-born jockey that is widely acknowledged to have been one of the greatest jockeys in horse racing history. Woolf began his racing career at the age of 16 in and went on to win three Santa Anita Derbies, two Santa Catalina Stakes, two Hollywood Gold Cups and the Whitney Handicap. Woolf was also the jockey of Triple Crown winner, Citation. After his family immigrated to Canada, Woolf began his racing career at the Rocky Mountain track near Calgary. In 1921, he rode at the Oklahoma City track and caught the eye of the racing secretary, who soon had seen enough to offer Woolf a job in California. In 1924, Woolf won his first race in the United States and began riding at Santa Anita Park shortly thereafter. At Santa Anita, Woolf won 22 consecutive races in 1927, the first of his many competitive and successful feats. He went on to win three Santa Anita Derbies, two Santa Catalina Stakes, two Hollywood Gold Cups, and the Whitney Handicap. In 1948, Woolf won his last race at Santa Anita, 21 years after winning his first. Woolf earned a great deal of fame and was dubbed the Iceman of the Turf because of his cool temper and his ability to remain level-headed during a race. He was also known as the \"King of the West\" because of his incredible success in the area. He was known to be a forward thinker and a great judge of horses. In 1928, Woolf earned the right to ride the great Triple Crown winner, Citation for the entire series of races. He also rode Seabiscuit in the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap and defeated War Admiral by four lengths. In 1946, Woolf contracted pneumonia and died as a result of complications from the illness. His death, though tragic, was acknowledged in a poignant and respectful fashion by the horse racing community. As a tribute to Woolf's career, Santa Anita Park held the George Woolf Memorial Race annually from 1951 until 2008. The race was open to geldings only, and runners were required to base their race plan on Woolf's riding style, which was to wait patiently until the final stretch before making a move. In 2009, the race was combined with several other minor stakes races under a new format known as the BetfairTVG Horseracing Triple. George Woolf is one of the most iconic figures in horse racing, and his legacy lives on through the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, which is given annually by the Jockey's Guild to the most outstanding jockey. In 2010, Woolf was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1945547}

Placid is a high school misfit whose ambition is to become \"normal\" and accepted by his peers. Half-hearted attempts at conforming however, don't do the trick and Placid's true individualism and talents eventually win out. The movie follows Placid as he is sent to an alternative school after being expelled from regular school for disruption. It's here that the title of the movie is taken literally, with Placid becoming increasingly angry at being referred to as a \"freak\", so he decides to take matters into his own hands. He swaps his colourful clothes for suits and becomes a major success, impressing everyone around him. Placid's newfound success however, is met with disapproval by those closest to him. His friend, Margy, dislikes his ambitious attitude, while Placid's parents, played by Garry McDonald and Miranda Richardson, think he's sold out. Ultimately though, the film isn't about ambition or fitting in but rather self discovery as Placid eventually realizes that the most important thing is being true to yourself regardless of what others think. The Rage in Placid Lake had it's world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2003, where it was met with enthusiastic responses from both audiences and critics.

A series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a \"Plinian Core Flat\" [deprecated].\n\nAs a result, a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012. New formal requirements, additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation, as well as to align it with the processes of TDWG, the world reference body for biodiversity information standards.\n\nA new version, Plinian Core v3.x.x was defined. This provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios. New elements to deal with aspects such as IPR, related resources, referenced, etc. were introduced, and elements already included were better-defined and documented.\n\nPartner for the development of Plinian Core in this new phase incorporated the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP, Brazil).\n\nA \"Plinian Core Task Group\" within TDWG \"Interest Group on species Information\" was constituted and currently working on its development.\n\nLevels of the standard \nPlinian Core is presented in to levels: the abstract model and the application profiles.\n\nThe abstract model (AM), comprising the abstract model schema(xsd)  and the terms' URIs, is the normative part. It is all comprehensive, and allows for different levels of granularity in describing species properties. The AM should be taken as a \"menu\" from which to choose terms and level of detail needed in any specific project.\n\nThe subsets of the abstract model intended to be implemented in specific projects are the \"application profiles\" (APs). Besides containing part of the elements of the AM, APs can impose additional specifications on the included elements, such as controlled vocabularies.  Some examples of APs in use follow:\n Application profile CONABIO\n Application profile INBIO\n Application profile GBIF.ES\n Application profile Banco de Datos de la Naturaleza.Spain\n Application profile SIB-COLOMBIA\n\nRelation to other standards \nPlinian incorporates a number of elements already defined by other standards.

The facility consists of a network of underground tunnels, structures and laboratories spread out on eight buildings, with a total of over 60 test cells. Plinian Core is designed to house a series of large scale experiments involving explosives, ranging from low to high explosives. Plinian Core also houses a radiochemistry laboratory that provides a suite of facilities for the study of radiochemistry and radioactive material. The facility is most notably used to investigate the initiation of nuclear weapons, and is one of only two facilities in the United States dedicated to complete testing of nuclear weapons in a safe and secure manner. These experiments include the first test experiments of modern day thermonuclear weapons, and contribute to the overall knowledge of how volatile materials interact. Plinian Core is located at the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands and was constructed for testing nuclear weapons during the US occupation of the Marianas islands in the late 1940s. Since its establishment, the site has also been heavily used for weapons research and development, including development of chemical and biological weapons. The facility is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory. It is currently used for research in the fields of hazardous material testing, high explosives safety, and law enforcement training and is subject to strict safety guidelines by the Department of Energy. Plinian Core is regarded as an important asset to the US Government's explorations in the field of nuclear weapons research and development. The facility has greatly contributed to the knowledge of how dangerous materials can interact, and is of great importance in advancing security in the international community.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 49236889}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"St David's Church, Barmouth\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "St David's Church is a Church in Wales church by the harbour of Barmouth, Gwynedd, west Wales. It is part of the Bro Ardudwy Ministry Area.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\nAs late as 1824, the parish church, St Mary's, Llanaber was the only Anglican place of worship in the area. At that time, the numbers of tourists and visitors was increasing and the Rector, Rev. T G Roberts, saw the necessity of building a new church for the English worshippers. So, in 1824, he convened a vestry meeting of the Churchwardens and the most influential church people of the district to discuss the advisability of erecting a Chapel of Ease. It was resolved to apply to the Bishop of Bangor for his permission, but the bishop only gave his assent on the condition that the cost of the building should be defrayed by voluntary subscription. The rector accomplished this task having immediately commenced collecting necessary funds.\n\nConstruction\nThese efforts on behalf of the church were rewarded and on 4 December 1830 Reverend Roberts was able to submit a plan and particulars of the proposed sanctuary. The church designed by Edward Haycock of Shrewsbury is a neat Cruciform structure built in the later style of English architecture and contains accommodation for 470 people of which 230 places were to be free, in consideration of a grant of \u00a3300 from the Incorporated Society for Building and Repairing Churches and Chapels.\n\nThe church was built at the southern end of Barmouth, on a site that was formerly a ship building yard. At the time of the erection of the church there was a great deal of opposition to the site; the opposing faction contending that sand-drifts would make the approach practically inaccessible.\n\nFor some years after the erection of this church, sand-drifts did indeed prove a source of great annoyance to the worshippers. A resident of Barmouth, Mr Black (author of 'A Picturesque Tour') exclaimed that St David's Church was very badly situated. Over time, the effects of sand-drifts eased and then ceased altogether.\n\nSupport\nAmong the chief supporters of the Anglican church in Barmouth in the 1830s and 1840s were a family called Ricketts who lived in Aberamffa House now modernised into Orielton Hall. In 1845, the Rector received a magnificent silver Sacrament Cup with the inscription 'The Offering of M. A. Rth' from Mrs Ricketts. The donation was accompanied by the following letter:\n\n\"Dear Sir, Captain Barrow will deliver to you a case containing the Sacramental Cup which we were accustomed to lend to the Chapel at Barmouth, for the celebration of the Communion. It is my wish to make a gift of it in perpetuity and I shall be obliged to you to have it noted in the Parish Documents so that it belongs absolutely to the Church.\"\n\nExtensions\n\n19th century\nAs time progressed it became very desirous that alterations should be effected and at a vestry meeting held to discuss the matter on 25 November 1886, it was resolved to build a new vestry - to have a wooden floor, a new approach at the north east corner and to have sundry other small alterations made at a total cost not exceeding \u00a3100.\n\nFurther additions and alterations were made over the course of the coming decades. The current altar was built in 1880, a font formed of five stone centre columns, was donated by Margaret and Edmund Humphreys and family and was originally placed by the main entrance. Mr Alex R Gibbs of London created and installed a wonderful stained glass window at the east end behind the altar in the 1880s.\n\n20th century\nDuring the 20th Century, a 2 manual Nicholson Organ was installed. It was done in 1910, when a new room was constructed to contain all of the new Organ's water pressure pumping equipment. In 1974, Lady Russon, the High Sheriff of Merionethshire, donated oil painting copies of cartoons drawn by Raphael depicting the lives of St Peter and St Paul. The originals are housed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nServices\nFrom the time of its erection until the opening of St John's Church in 1895, English services were held in the morning and Welsh services at night.  St David's is not currently open as a place of worship with all services taking place at St John's Church.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Barmouth\n St John's Church, Barmouth\n St Mary and St Bodfan Church, Llanaber\n\nSources\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Barmouth Parish site\n\nBarmouth, St David", "machine_text": " St David's Church, Barmouth is an Anglican church located in the town of Barmouth, in the county of Gwynedd, Wales.

The Church is a key element of the local area and its appearance adds to the character of Barmouth. It has been designed in a style often referred to as \"simple13th Century Gothic\". A large Welsh lintel above the entrance dated 1601 is a reminder of its past. The church is rectangular in shape with a low chancel, a south transept and the porch to the north. The interior contains a nave of four evenly-spaced bays, with the usual Gothic arcade of lancet windows with cinquefoiled ogee tops lighting the centre. There is a circular font of the 19th century with a tapering stem and a ribbed bowl. In 1850 a new vestry was added to the north side in a Victorian Gothic style. At the west end of the church is a three-lighted window containing a scene depicting St David and the two saints whose relics were reclaimed in a notable incident from the 12th century when some of the earlier reliquaries were stolen by a robber. This is the earliest window known to depict St David, the patron saint of Wales, in stained glass. The church is very active in the community, providing a place of worship for local people and visitors. Church activities include weekly services, special events and baptisms, and the church also supports an active community outreach program including donations to local charities.

The trio consults a professor for help and learns about a cursed frat house that was demolished years before. On Halloween, the sisters decide to throw a Halloween party in the old frat house and invite their neighbors, even though it is supposedly haunted. During the party, secrets are revealed, rival friendships are formed, and the girls must band together to survive the night. After a series of murders, the girls discover the killer is not another sinister spirit, but one of their own. It is up to them to solve the mystery and find out who the real killer is. The film has gained a cult following due to its cheesy, over-the-top special effects, an impressive array of villains, and the way the story intertwines with the Halloween spirit. While Sorority House was an independent film, it was later picked up by HBO and had an international release.

All license plates are recorded!\" and \"Over 2 million will see you on war-line.net.\" They sometimes yelled comments at persons who entered the property and offered free Bibles.\n\nThe protests were not without controversy however. In addition to building a platform to look over a fence constructed by the business to maintain their practice of photographing people walking in and out of the store, several complaints were also issued over the shining of a floodlight in the faces of drivers passing by, in preparation to take a photograph if they entered the property, leading to several near misses with protesters and other autos.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, in response to a lawsuit filed by Jackson County, special Bartholomew Circuit Court judge Stephen R. Heimann, a Democrat, ruled that the store violated a county licensing ordinance and must be closed. He ruled that the county could constitutionally bar the business from operating at the location as part of its intent to protect the health, safety, and welfare of county residents, and that the ordinance was content neutral since it did not seek to ban adult businesses. Lion's Den violated the ordinance because it was operating within 1,000 feet of a residence. Jackson County commissioners adopted the ordinance three days before Lion's Den opened, after they discovered it was going to be an adult business. The store closed within days after the ruling while Lion's Den appealed the case. On June 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals of Indiana unanimously affirmed Judge Heimann's ruling. Lion's Den is an Ohio-based company with about 30 stores across the United States at the time of the Crothersville conflict.\n\nIn 2008, Melvin Ray Owen, a spokesman and organizer for the anti-pornography protesters was arrested for sexual battery on a girl of 16.  Reverend Roger Smith, who testified on behalf of Owen, told the court, that Owen was \"touchy-feely. He hugs everybody in church. It is out of character for him be anything but someone who wants to do good.\u201d Owen claimed that he was the victim of an aggressive girl who had been propositioning him: \u201cI touched her breast, I did. I also blowed on her hair and punched her ribs. It wasn\u2019t an accident and I\u2019ll tell you why. I touched her to try to get her off my lap and she wouldn\u2019t get off it.\" After changing his plea to guilty, Owen was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 90 days home incarceration.\n\nDrug bootlegging and a homicide\nOn February 10, 2005, Crothersville was featured in a New York Times article about the town's alleged \"scourge of methamphetamine.\" The Times''' narrative was that a town \"where everyone seems somehow related,\" is \"seemingly transformed\" by the death of a 10-year-old, Katlyn Collman, who \"police say...stumbled on (sic) someone with methamphetamine...\" The story highlights a Crothersville stricken with fear after the death and the discovery of two facilities for making bootleg methamphetamine. Without explaining who they are or where they have gone, the article claims that \"Shady characters no longer stalk the streets of the one-stoplight town, where ribbons of blue, Katie's favorite color, hang from utility poles and porches. Gone, too, are the bike-riding and dog-walking youngsters, now let outside to play only with their parents, or in groups.\" One father \"said he checks what his 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter are wearing each morning, for fear of having to describe them to the police.\" The article claims that in \"Jackson County, which includes Crothersville, meth-related arrests skyrocketed to 116 in 2004 from 29 in 2002.\" Pastor Jon Pearce, who helped to organize the protest against Lion's Den, is quoted regarding the purported illegal drug problem: \"If we had a brothel move into town, people would close it down instantly. If we had an X-rated movie house come, it'd be gone within a week. But this has been here. It is a monster. We didn't know what kind of monster it was.\" The Times article includes no crime statistics for Crothersville that might affirm the implication that the town was dangerous.\n\nOn May 25, 2005, the Times reported that, \"Tossing aside their original theory that a 10-year-old Indiana girl was murdered because she saw people making methamphetamine, prosecutors on Friday dropped charges against the man whose statements led them to that belief, charging instead another man connected by DNA and other physical evidence to the crime.\" The Times quoted a local merchant claiming to have \"sold 2,000 T-shirts with Katie's photograph to people in four states, [who] said that even if the methamphetamine theory had no merit, the murder 'shined a light on the drug problem' in town.\" The Times reported, \"Steven Drizin, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, said the case had the hallmark of a false, coerced confession..\" The Times'' did not refer to or retract its own inaccurate reporting in the February article. CBS did its part to promote hysteria with a report titled, \"Girl's Murder Amplifies Drug War.\"\n\nAnthony Ray Stockelman, pleaded guilty to abducting, molesting, and murdering the child and received a sentence of life in prison. He had no prior criminal record, and no cited connection to methamphetamine. A cousin of the victim, serving a burglary sentence in the same facility where Stockelman was held, was charged for tattooing \"Katie's Revenge\" on the forehead of her killer.\n\nEducation\nCrothersville has a public library, a branch of the Jackson County Public Library.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Town of Crothersville, Indiana website\n\nTowns in Jackson County, Indiana\nTowns in Indiana\nPopulated places established in 1835", "machine_text": " Crothersville, Indiana is a small town located in Jackson County, Indiana. It is located just west of Seymour and roughly seventy miles south of Indianapolis. It is the smallest town by population in the county. The population was 1,129 at the 2010 census. History Crothersville was laid out in 1832. It was named for its founder, William Crothers, who was a local farmer. The town is located in a region that was historically part of the home range of the Miami people. The town was originally a farming community, with many of its original settlers coming from North Carolina. By 1847, it had become an important center for the production of hogs and tobacco. In the late nineteenth century, the town began to develop a strong industrial base. The first brickyard opened in 1892 and it soon had multiple brickyards and two glass plant factories, one of which was built in 1898. This factor, combined with a nearby railroad that connected Crothersville to Louisville, allowed the town to expand quickly. By the turn of the century, Crothersville was a bustling town with business and industry at its peak. It was also home to many cultural and educational institutions, including a college, a public library, two banks, and a newspaper. The decline of the industrial sector in the mid-twentieth century affected Crothersville significantly. Many citizens moved away in search of job opportunities, leaving empty buildings and vacant lots behind. However, many of these businesses have been restored, and a series of local festivals and events have been created to promote tourism. Today Crothersville is a small rural town with a small-town charm. It is a popular destination for many people in the region, and it is the home of several attractions, including a golf course, a flea market, and the annual Crothersville Red Pepper Festival. The town is also home to two natural parks: Crothersville Woods Nature Park and Richard Huff Park. The town retains much of its historic character and is a popular place for residents and visitors alike to roam the streets and visit the local businesses. Many of the historic buildings are still standing and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Crothersville remains a friendly and welcoming community that is proud of its heritage and is dedicated to the preservation of its unique culture. The town continues to be an ideal location for cultural and recreational activities.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 112357}

He won the European Cup with Celtic in 1967 along with several domestic honours. His other clubs included Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers, Heart of Midlothian and Dumbarton in the Scottish leagues, and Crystal Palace in English football.\n\nWallace played for Scotland seven times and was inducted into the national Hall of Fame in 2017 for his club achievements.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\nHe started his senior playing career with Stenhousemuir as a teenager in 1958 (having played alongside Jim Storrie at Kilsyth Rangers), moving to Raith Rovers a year later. It was in Kirkcaldy that \"Wispy\", as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.\n\nHearts\nWallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending \u00a315,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the \"Golden Vision\", whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962\u201363, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965\u201366. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the Scottish League Cup in 1962 and come within a goal of winning the 1964\u201365 Scottish Football League title, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.\n\nIn 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goalscoring ceased and, amid rumours that he had been \"tapped\" up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid \u00a330,000 to secure his services. He played a total of 248 matches for Hearts in all competitions, scoring 131 goals.\n\nCeltic\nWithin six months of joining Celtic, Wallace was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the \"Lisbon Lions\", the famous team who won the European Cup in 1967. He was later part of the team that reached the 1970 European Cup Final but was defeated 2\u20131 by Feyenoord. He also won the league championship in each of the four seasons he was at the Glasgow club, plus the Scottish Cup in 1967, 1969 and 1971 and the League Cup in 1968 and 1968 during an era widely considered the greatest in the club's history. In total, he scored 140 goals for Celtic in 239 games.\n\nLater career\nAfter five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of \u00a330,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won two league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976\u201377 season.\n\nInternational career\nIn total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish Football League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.\n\nCareer after retirement\nRetiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee. When this role ended he returned to APIA as a coach, eventually settling in Sydney and starting his own sports shop.\n\nIn 2008, Tommy Burns, a former Celtic player and manager, died; Wallace helped organise a tribute match played on 31 May 2009 at Celtic Park, attended by over 35,000 people. The Celtic squad of the time defeated the 'Tommy Burns Select' team 11\u20134.

It was also the club's 150th year in existence and to mark the occasion the club had a special crest and the away kit was the same colours that Stoke Ramblers wore back in 1863, navy and cardinal Stoke also had a new shirt sponsor Bet365 taking over from Britannia.\n\nThe summer of 2012 saw the departure of fan favourite Ricardo Fuller whilst in came winger Michael Kightly and USA defender Geoff Cameron, later followed by Charlie Adam and Steven Nzonzi. Stoke began the season with four straight draws and an embarrassing League Cup exit to Swindon Town. Despite recording one victory in their opening ten match they did  put in some impressive performances away at Chelsea and Manchester United and at home to champions Manchester City. Stoke then went ten matches undefeated from 10 November to 29 December with a 3\u20131 victory over Liverpool on boxing day the stand out result.\n\nDuring that run Stoke conceded just seven goals but at the turn of the year their form and performances dropped off as in the next ten matches Stoke picked up just five points, scored only six goals and conceded 19. Results and performances failed to improve and after an awful defeat at home to Aston Villa, Stoke were in danger of being involved in the relegation battle. Back to back wins against Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City lifted Stoke away from the foot of the table and they recovered to finish in 13th position with 42 points. At the end of the season manager Tony Pulis left the club by mutual consent bringing an end to his seven-year tenure at the club. He was replaced by the former Wales, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers manager Mark Hughes.\n\nPre-season\nThere was expectation that several players would leave the club in the summer with a number reaching the end of their contacts and chairman Peter Coates said that Tony Pulis will have to sell if he wants to buy. Pulis released Louis Moult, Tom Soares, Salif Diao and club legend Ricardo Fuller after the end of their contracts and Jonathan Woodgate and Danny Collins left for Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest respectively. On 8 August Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Michael Kightly joined that club for an undisclosed fee.\n\nFor the 2012\u201313 pre-season, Stoke travelled to the United States where they will spend eleven days and play matches against Major League Soccer sides Columbus Crew and Sporting Kansas City as well as affiliated USL Pro club Orlando City. Matches were also arranged against Swiss side FC Sion and German Bundesliga team SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth.\n\nStoke began their pre-season in Switzerland and played a match against FC Sion which was won 1\u20130 thanks to a penalty from Matthew Etherington. City then travelled to The USA and played their first match against the Columbus Crew. Despite taking the lead via Jonathan Walters the Americans were much brighter and scored twice through Aaron Horton and Ben Speas. The next match against affiliated club Orlando City saw Stoke win 1\u20130 with Walters scoring his second goal of pre-season but it was marred with Glenn Whelan being sent off after a harmless altercation with former Stoke midfielder James O'Connor. Stoke's final match in USA against Sporting Kansas City saw Stoke miss a number of chances but did eventually take the lead with six minutes left when Michael Tonge whose only contribution to the club is in pre-season was fouled in the area and he scored the spot kick. Stoke however conceded a comical equaliser as Asmir Begovi\u0107's clearance went straight to Kyle Miller who had the easy task of heading the ball into an empty net.\n\nOn their return to England they played two matches against Football League opposition, Torquay United and Yeovil Town. Both matches ended 1\u20131 and they had a Polish international trialist Sebastian Boenisch playing at left back. The final match of pre-season saw Stoke take on German side SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth in Bavaria. New signing Michael Kightly made a perfect start to his Stoke career scoring with his first touch. Matthew Upson gave away a penalty and Bernd Nehrig scored from the spot and for the four time in pre-season that match finished 1\u20131. Afterwards Tony Pulis revealed that Stoke had agreed to take Macedonian left back Goran Popov on loan from Dynamo Kyiv until the end of the season. However the move collapsed as he failed to gain a work permit.\n\nPremier League\n\nAugust\n\nStoke's first league match of the 2012\u201313 season saw them come up against newly promoted Reading at the Madejski Stadium. New signing Michael Kightly made his league debut and marked it with scoring the opening goal albeit thanks to an error from \"Royals\" goalkeeper Adam Federici. The home side were not posing much of a threat to Stoke's goal but they were gifted the chance to equalise in the final minute of the match as Dean Whitehead brought down Garath McCleary in the area and conceded a penalty, and to make matters worse for Whitehead he was shown a second yellow. Adam Le Fondre made no mistake from the spot and it was a case of two points dropped for Stoke.\n\nThe first home match of the season was against old adversaries Arsenal with the match being broadcast live on TV. Geoff Cameron made his first appearance in a red and white shirt and produced a good performance in a match which surprisingly failed to live up to the buildup. There were few moments of excitement with Jonathan Walters having Stoke's best effort, hitting the back of the net but it was ruled out for offside. The \"Gunners\" struggled to make Asmir Begovi\u0107 work in the City goal and the match finished in a rather tame goalless draw. On transfer deadline day Stoke completed the signings of midfielders Charlie Adam, Maurice Edu and Steven Nzonzi.\n\nSeptember\nCharlie Adam and Maurice Edu were both on the bench for the match at 'bogey' side Wigan Athletic. Stoke made a terrible start to the match conceding a penalty after just four minutes after Robert Huth handled in the area and Shaun Maloney made no mistake from the spot. The away support were beginning to vent their frustration towards Pulis but after half an hour he brought on Adam for his debut. He impressed instantly with his passing ability and Stoke were awarded a penalty of their own just before half time, Jonathan Walters scoring for Stoke. But poor defending at the start of the second half gifted Franco Di Santo a goal and Stoke were again chasing the match. Peter Crouch scored his first league goal of the season and Stoke could have won it but for a wonder save from Ali Al-Habsi denying Adam a debut goal.\n\nOn 4 September Stoke announced the signing of former Real Madrid and England striker Michael Owen on a one-year contract. Nzonzi and Adam made their home debuts against Premier League title holders Manchester City as Stoke lined up in a new look formation which included three centre midfielders. And it was Stoke who took the lead via Peter Crouch, although TV replays showed that he handled in the buildup. Stoke then had to as expected weather a lot of pressure from Man City but they leveled from a set play, Javi Garc\u00eda being left unmarked. Michael Owen came off the bench for the final few moments as Begovi\u0107 and Shawcross prevented Manchester City winning the match late on. It was Stoke's fourth draw in a row and all from the start of a season, a club record. After the match Andy Wilkinson was handed a three match ban after an off the ball altercation with Mario Balotelli.\n\nStoke then played Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and were the better side for most of the 90 minutes. They had chances to take the points with Walters hitting the crossbar and Kightly and Crouch guilty of missed opportunities and Chelsea took full advantage with Ashley Cole scoring with five minutes left handing Stoke an undeserved defeat.\n\nStoke went into their next match at home to Swansea looking for their first win of the season and that's what they got after a simple enough victory. Michael Laudrup's Swansea as expected enjoyed a large amount of possession but they never threatened to trouble Stoke's defence and Peter Crouch scored twice before half time to settle the contest.\n\nOctober\n\nPrior to the League match against Liverpool Stoke were handed a boost when captain Ryan Shawcross earned a call up to the England team. The match against Liverpool saw both sides cancel each other out in a bad tempered 0\u20130 draw.\n\nAfter the international break Stoke completed their tough set of opening fixtures away at Manchester United. Stoke made a great start and took the lead through an own goal by Wayne Rooney and Stoke could have added to their goal tally with Adam and Walters going close. But poor defending cost Stoke dearly as Rooney, Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck saw the \"Red Devils\" turn the match in their favour. Kightly pulled one back but Rooney scored his second goal to make it 4\u20132.\n\nThe next match saw Stoke and Sunderland play out an uneventful and lifeless goalless draw at the Britannia but it proved to be a costly one for Stoke as left back Marc Wilson broke his fibula.\n\nNovember\n\nStoke then put in a poor performance away at Norwich City going down by a solitary goal from Bradley Johnson.\n\nStoke went into their next match then against bottom of the table Queens Park Rangers looking for a much needed win. It was a scrappy encounter with Rangers' Adel Taarabt causing City's defence problems with his skill but were also thankful for his poor decision making which left him squandering QPR's best chances. Charlie Adam scored his first goal for Stoke just after half time and that proved to be the winning goal.\n\nStoke's next match was against in form West Ham United moved to a Monday night for live TV coverage. Stoke began the match brightly and scored through Walters after 13 minutes via a well worked corner routine. City continued to dominate the first half and almost scored again but Nzonzi's powerful shot cannoned off the woodwork. However it was role reversal in the second half at the \"Hammers\" took control of the game and soon levelled through Joey O'Brien but Stoke fought off West Ham's revival and earned a decent point.\n\nStoke then began a three-game week with a home match against Fulham and for the second match at the Britannia the match was settled by a single goal from Charlie Adam. Stoke had several chances to win by a bigger margin but were guilty of poor finishing.\n\nThe mid-week match against an out of form Newcastle United side saw Stoke come from behind to claim a late victory. Papiss Ciss\u00e9 put the \"Magpies\" in front just after half time capitalising on an error from Glenn Whelan. Substitutes Kenwyne Jones and Cameron Jerome then came off the bench to spark Stoke's turnaround. Firstly, Jerome provided an assist for Jonathan Walters and then scored the winning goal after being set up by Jones.\n\nDecember\n\nStoke's then played high-flying West Bromwich Albion who at the time were in the top four. Stoke produced a disciplined defensive performance nullifying Albion's attack and grabbed a 1\u20130 win thanks to a rare goal from Dean Whitehead.\n\nStoke again played away at Midlands opponents this time Aston Villa and both sides cancelled each other out in a drab goalless draw. Stoke had Ryan Shotton sent off for two bookable offences.\n\nStoke then played out a bruising 1\u20131 draw with Everton on 15 December. The \"Toffees\" took the lead after Steven Pienaar's cross was deflected into the net by Ryan Shawcross and the visitors almost scored again soon after with Leon Osman missing from close range. Stoke levelled thanks to Kenwyne Jones' first league goal since August 2011 but the major indecent of the match saw Marouane Fellaini deliberately headbutt Shawcross which was missed by referee Mark Halsey. After the match Fellaini issued a public apology to Shawcross and was given a retrospective three match ban.\n\nCity then earned their fifth goalless draw of the season (10th in total) with an impressive defensive display at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nOn Boxing day City took on Liverpool in a late evening kick-off and the visitors took the lead very early on as after just 30 seconds Luis Su\u00e1rez was fouled in the area and Steven Gerrard scored the spot kick. Stoke instantly replied with Walters and then Jones to turn the game around and victory was completed in the second half with Walters scoring a second to earn Stoke a 3\u20131 win.\n\nThe final match of 2012 saw another incident packed 90 minutes against Southampton. Stoke without key defensive duo Shawcross and Cameron saw the \"Saints\" take the lead through Rickie Lambert but Stoke soon levelled though a Jones back heel. Then two awful defensive mistakes gave the away side a 3\u20131 lead. Stoke pulled one back through Matthew Upson midway through the second half and then had Steven Nzonzi sent off for an apparent stamp on Jack Cork. Stoke did make it 3\u20133 with Cameron Jerome scoring from 30 yards in the final minute. Nzonzi's red card was later rescinded by the FA.\n\nJanuary\n\nStoke began 2013 with another tame 3\u20130 defeat away at Manchester City on 1 January, ending Stoke's ten-match unbeaten run. Manchester City were in complete control of the match and only their poor finishing prevented them taking the lead. Eventually they did break the deadlock just before half-time after James Milner's cross was blocked by Begovi\u0107 but Pablo Zabaleta was able to score the rebound. The second half continued in the same vein and after Sergio Ag\u00fcero's shot was parried by the Stoke keeper his compatriot Edin D\u017eeko scored a simple tap-in. Stoke tried to hit back through a Charlie Adam free-kick before Walters blazed a shot over from close-range. Stoke's misery was compounded when Nzonzi fouled David Silva and conceded a penalty which Ag\u00fcero converted, with Nzonzi receiving a yellow card for the foul.\n\nChelsea then ended Stoke's 11-month unbeaten home run in the Premier League in emphatic fashion beating Stoke 4\u20130. However it was a harsh scoreline as Chelsea's goals came from two own goals from, Jonathan Walters a Frank Lampard penalty and a long-range effort from Eden Hazard. To add to Walters' woe he also missed a last minute penalty.\n\nStoke's awful start to 2013 continued with a poor 3\u20131 loss at Swansea City After a goalless first half Swansea dominated the second period and took the lead through their full-back Ben Davies. After Adam had fouled Michu, Dutch midfielder Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n curled in the free-kick and then Jerome missed an easy chance to pull one back for Stoke. de Guzm\u00e1n ended the game as a contest when he scored to complete a flowing Swansea move although Stoke did manage to get a consolation goal, Michael Owen scoring in the final minute for what was his 150th Premier League goal.\n\nStoke then threw away a two-goal lead against Wigan Athletic on 29 January, their fourth 2\u20132 draw with Wigan in four seasons. Stoke ended the month by completing the transfers of USA international Brek Shea and England goalkeeper Jack Butland.\n\nFebruary\n\nStoke continued their poor run with a narrow 1\u20130 defeat at Arsenal courtesy of a Lukas Podolski free-kick.\n\nStoke secured their first league win of 2013 against Reading. After a goalless first half Stoke scored through a Robert Huth header and a fine goal from Jerome but the Royals quickly responded with Adrian Mariappa heading a late corner but Stoke held on for a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nAfter a two-week international break Stoke travelled to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham. Stoke failed to improve on their terrible away record of one win in 23 as Martin Jol's side won 1\u20130 thanks to a fine volley from Dimitar Berbatov. Stoke had the chance to earn a point from the penalty spot but Walters's kick was weak and easily saved by Mark Schwarzer. It got worse for Stoke as Huth was given a retrospective three match ban after an off the ball altercation with Philippe Senderos.\n\nMarch\n\nWith Huth suspended Marc Wilson filled in a centre back against West Ham United in what was another poor performance by Stoke. West Ham scored the only goal via Jack Collison and the Stoke supporters began to vent their frustration at manager Tony Pulis.\n\nStoke's next away match was against Newcastle United and Stoke took the lead in the second half with Walters converting a penalty which he won. Stoke could not hold out for a point though as the Magpies drew level through a Yohan Cabaye free-kick and then Papiss Ciss\u00e9 scored in the final minute to extended Stoke's losing run to three matches.\n\nThe Midlands derby against West Brom was a good opportunity for Stoke to end their poor form but it turned out to be a frustrating afternoon. There was few chances from both sides and Stoke's best chance came in the final minute through Kenwyne Jones but he could only hit his shot straight at Ben Foster and the match finished in a drab 0\u20130 draw.\n\nStoke's final game of a barren March saw them travel to Everton. Stoke missed a glorious chance to take an early lead after a Ryan Shotton long throw-in was headed towards goal by Huth and saved by Tim Howard, Walters could only hit the crossbar. Everton had a couple half-chances though Nikica Jelavi\u0107 before they scored in fine style. A Marc Wilson cross was punched away by Howard and the ball fell for Belgian Kevin Mirallas who broke clear of the retreating Stoke defence and slotted the ball past Begovi\u0107. Stoke had chances in the second half to pull level but failed to take them with Walters, Huth, Shotton and Jerome all guilty of poor finishing and Everton won the match 1\u20130.\n\nApril\n\nStoke entered the final six games of the 2012\u201313 season with a vital home match against Midlands rivals Aston Villa at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke got off to an awful start after poor defending let in Gabriel Agbonlahor to score after ten minutes. Stoke failed to trouble Brad Guzan and Villa almost scored again through Andreas Weimann whose shot hit the post. City improved marginally after the break and scored in the 80th minute through substitute Michael Kightly. But Villa defender Matthew Lowton then scored an unstoppable goal, a volley from 30 yards and with Stoke pushing for an equaliser they were caught on the counterattack and Christian Benteke sealed a 3\u20131 win and left Stoke fully involved in the relegation fight.\n\nStoke's slide towards the relegation zone continued with 2\u20130 home defeat against champions elect Manchester United on 14 April. The Potters made an awful start conceding after just four minutes after a Robin van Persie corner was not dealt with by the Stoke defence and the ball was prodded in by Michael Carrick. Stoke rarely threatened David de Gea and when he was finally tested by Charlie Adam Stoke gave away a penalty after Wilkinson fouled van Persie in the area who converted the spot kick. Pulis decided to impose a media ban for the remainder of the season on his players in order to 'keep them focused'.\n\nCity then travelled to lowly Queens Park Rangers and came away with a vital 2\u20130 victory only their 2nd win of 2013. Peter Crouch scored for the first time since January and a Walters penalty lifted Stoke six points away from danger.\n\nStoke then beat Norwich City 1\u20130 on 27 April to move them onto the 40 point mark in a match which saw the supporters pay tribute to former player Paul Ware. Charlie Adam scored the only goal of the game just after half-time, Stoke could have added a second but Crouch was guilty of some poor finishing.\n\nMay\n\nStoke played relegation threatened Sunderland on 6 May and Stoke took a 9th-minute lead through Walters after Sunderland failed to clear a Charlie Adam corner. It got worse for the Black Cats as Craig Gardner was sent-off for a foul on Adam just before half time. However Sunderland managed to earn a point thanks to a goal from John O'Shea.\n\nThe last home match of the 2012\u201313 season against Tottenham Hotspur was used as a 'celebration match' for the club's 150th anniversary. To mark the occasion 80 former players attended the match and performed a lap of honour whilst the supporters received a free T-shirt. Stoke started the match brilliantly with Steven Nzonzi scoring his first goal for City after just three minutes. Spurs levelled through Clint Dempsey who punished a defensive mix-up between Wilson and Begovi\u0107. Just after half time Stoke's task was made harder when Charlie Adam picked up a second yellow card meaning Stoke had to play the remaining 40 minutes with ten men. Stoke couldn't hold on to a draw as Emmanuel Adebayor scored the winning goal for Spurs.\n\nStoke ended the 2012\u201313 season with a 1\u20131 draw away at Southampton, Crouch scoring just after half time for Stoke before Rickie Lambert made sure the season ended with a draw. It proved to be Pulis' final game in charge of Stoke as two days later he left the club by mutual consent. He was replaced by fellow Welshman Mark Hughes. This was also the final match in Michael Owen's career, in only his 8th appearance for Stoke he got a standing ovation from both set of fans.\n\nResults\n\nFinal league table\n\nFA Cup\n\nStoke were drawn away at Championship side Crystal Palace in the third round and the match at Selhurst Park saw both sides cancel each other out in a 0\u20130 draw meaning that a replay would be required.\n\nThe replay was a far more eventful affair which began with the tricky Wilfried Zaha winning a penalty but Jermaine Easter's spot kick was saved by S\u00f8rensen. Kenwyne Jones put Stoke in front on 70 minutes before Palace were awarded another penalty which Glenn Murray converted to send the tie into extra time. With Palace tiring Stoke took full advantage and a brace from Walters and a last minute strike from Cameron Jerome earned Stoke a 4\u20131 victory.\n\nThe fourth round saw a repeat of the 2011 FA Cup Final, unfortunately for Stoke the outcome was the same, Man City winning 1\u20130, thanks to a late strike from Pablo Zabaleta.\n\nLeague Cup\n\nStoke were on the receiving end of a cup upset as League One Swindon Town knocked Stoke out in the second round. The \"Robins\" showed no fear at playing at the Britannia Stadium and took the lead through James Collins after a Thomas S\u00f8rensen mistake. Swindon and Collins scored again just before half time and they also had chances to increase their goal tally much to the anger of Stoke fans who booed their team off at half time. In the second half Stoke scored through Kenwyne Jones and Jonathan Walters to send the tie into extra time. However, despite squandering their two-goal lead Swindon were not affected and scored again through Aden Flint but Peter Crouch replied for Stoke. Jamie Ness had to leave the action after picking up an injury and it seemed it would go all the way to a penalty shoot-out but Collins beat the offside trap and claimed his hat-trick and victory for Paolo Di Canio's Swindon.\n\nSquad statistics\n\nTransfers\n\nIn\n\nOut\n\nLoan out\n\nReferences\n\nStoke City\nStoke City F.C. seasons", "machine_text": " 2012\u201313 Stoke City F.C. season is the 114th season of the English club Stoke City F.C. and their sixth season competing in the Premier League,the top flight of English football. It is their fifth consecutive season in the top flight of English football, since their promotion from the Football League Championship in the 2008/2009 season. The season began on 18 August 2012 with a 3\u20131 home win against Reading, and concluded on 19 May 2013, with Stoke losing 5\u20131 away at Southampton. The season saw Stoke finish in 13th place with 45 points. They reached the final 16 stage of the 2012-13 League Cup, saw Joe Allen make his debut for the club in a 2\u20132 draw against Arsenal and also saw the arrival of American defender Geoff Cameron as a new player addition to the beginning of the season. Stoke were eliminated from the FA Cup at the first knock-out stage, when they were beaten 3\u20131 at Anfield by Premier League leaders Liverpool. In December, Tony Pulis left the club by mutual consent, ending a near-eight-year tenure at Stoke City. He was replaced by Mark Hughes, who was appointed on a 3-year contract. In his last match, Stoke claimed a 4\u20130 win at home to Wigan Athletic \u2013 a scoreline that marked Hughes\u2019 first match in charge. Player and staff overhauls saw the arrivals of Charlie Adam, Michael Kightly, Jack Butland, Jamie Ness, Marc Muniesa and Erik Pieters, whilst the season saw the departures of Michael Owen, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Rory Delap, Dave Kitson, Tuncay \u015eanl\u0131, Wilson Palacios and Carlo Nash. Despite a difficult start, the season ended well under Hughes, with Stoke defeating Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal away from home, and lifting the club to a finish of 13th place in the Premier League. The club also announced a record turn-over of \u00a378 million and the highest-ever position in the club's history - 46th in the Deloitte Football Money League. Overall, the 2012-13 was a successful season for Stoke, despite some mid-season turbulence. They finished the season strongly and even managed to secure a top-profit of \u00a31.8m in the 2012/13 season. This was the first time in five years that Stoke City held a top profit rather than a loss in a Premier League season.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35768080}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Las Vegas Strip\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South in Clark County, Nevada, that is known for its concentration of resort hotels and casinos. The Strip, as it is known, is about  long, and is immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester, but is often referred to simply as \"Las Vegas\".\n\nMany of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are on the Strip, known for its contemporary architecture, lights, and wide variety of attractions. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the world and is one of the driving forces for Las Vegas' economy. Most of the Strip has been designated as an All-American Road, and the North and South Las Vegas Strip routes are classified as Nevada Scenic Byways and National Scenic Byways.\n\nBoundaries\n\nHistorically, casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street sat outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard. In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was built exactly  outside the city limits. The sign is currently located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the location of the now-demolished Klondike Hotel and Casino and about  south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay, which is the Strip's southernmost casino.\n\nIn the strictest sense, \"the Strip\" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of .  Clark County uses the phrase Resort Corridor to describe the area including Las Vegas Boulevard between 215 Beltway and Sahara Avenue and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Sahara is widely considered the Strip's northern terminus, though travel guides typically extend it to the Strat  to the north. Mandalay Bay, just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the Klondike was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in the Strip on some definitions and travel guides). The Strip includes the \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years (1930s\u20131990s) \nThe first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the Pair-o-Dice Club in 1931, but the first casino-resort on what is currently the Strip was the El Rancho Vegas, which opened with 63 rooms on April 3, 1941 (and was destroyed by a fire in 1960). Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the Hotel Last Frontier in 1942. Organized crime figures such as New York's Bugsy Siegel took interest in the growing gaming center, and funded other resorts such as the Flamingo, which opened in 1946, and the Desert Inn, which opened in 1950. The funding for many projects was provided through the American National Insurance Company, which was based in the then-notorious gambling empire of Galveston, Texas. \n\nLas Vegas Boulevard South was previously called Arrowhead Highway, or Los Angeles Highway. The Strip was named by Los Angeles police officer and businessman Guy McAfee, after his hometown's Sunset Strip.\n\nIn 1950, mayor Ernie Cragin of the City of Las Vegas sought to annex the Strip, which was unincorporated territory, in order to expand the city's tax base to fund his ambitious building agenda and pay down the city's rising debt. Instead, Gus Greenbaum of the Flamingo led a group of casino executives to lobby the Clark County commissioners for town status. Two unincorporated towns were eventually created, Paradise and Winchester. More than two decades later, the Supreme Court of Nevada struck down a 1975 Nevada state law that would have folded the Strip and the rest of the urban areas of Clark County into the City of Las Vegas.\n\nCaesars Palace was established in 1966. In 1968, Kirk Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as president. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the International Hotel, with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today. The first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The Rossiya Hotel built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed Bally's.\n\nThe opening of The Mirage in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts.  Some of the key features of The Mirage included tropical landscapes with waterfalls, an erupting volcano, restaurants with world-class chefs, and a show with illusionists Siegfried & Roy.  In the 1990s, more than 12 new hotels opened, including themed hotels like the Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay.   At $1.7B, the most expensive hotel in the world at the time, The Bellagio, was built in the 1990s.  These huge facilities offer entertainment and dining options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like the Dunes, the Sands, and the Stardust.  In 1993, the launch of the Myst\u00e9re show at the new Treasure Island hotel by Cirque du Soleil marked a key point in transforming Las Vegas Strip entertainment.\n\nIn an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success.  The Wet 'n Wild water park opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. It closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished.  The current MGM Grand opened in 1993 with MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park, but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 Treasure Island closed its own video arcade and abandoned the previous pirate theme, adopting the new ti name.\n\nIn addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, the Strip is home to many attractions, such as M&M's World, Adventuredome and the Fashion Show Mall. Starting in the mid-1990s, the Strip became a popular New Year's Eve celebration destination.\n\n2000\u2013present\n\nWith the opening of Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn and Encore resorts, the strip trended towards the luxurious high end segment through most of the 2000s, while some older resorts added major expansions and renovations, including some de-theming of the earlier themed hotels. High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\n\nIn 2004, MGM Mirage announced plans for CityCenter, a , $7\u00a0billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It consists of hotel, casino, condo, retail, art, business and other uses on the site. CityCenter is currently the largest such complex in the world. Construction began in April 2006, with most elements of the project opened in late 2009. Also in 2006, the Las Vegas Strip lost its longtime status as the world's highest-grossing gambling center, falling to second place behind Macau.\n\nIn 2012, the High Roller Ferris wheel and a retail district called The LINQ Promenade broke ground in an attempt to diversify attractions beyond that of casino resorts. Renovations and rebrandings such as The Cromwell Las Vegas and the SLS Las Vegas continued to transform the Strip in 2014. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds opened in 2015. In 2016, T-Mobile Arena, The Park, and the Park Theater opened.\n\nOn October 1, 2017, a mass shooting occurred on the Strip at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel. 60 people were killed and 867 were injured. This incident became the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history.\n\nIn 2018, the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was renamed the Park MGM and in 2019, the SLS changed its name back to Sahara Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2021, the Pinball Hall of Fame moved near the \"Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign at the south end of the Strip. Also in 2021,  Resorts World Las Vegas, the first new hotel-casino built in a decade, opened on the site of the former Stardust Resort and Casino (later the site of the unfinished Echelon Place).\n\nFuture developments\n\nThe MSG Sphere at The Venetian, including a monorail stop, is being built behind The Palazzo and The Venetian. It was scheduled to open in 2021, but has been rescheduled to sometime in 2023.\n\nThe Fontainebleau Las Vegas (formerly the JW Marriott Las Vegas Blvd/The Drew Las Vegas) is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDream Las Vegas, a casino and 20-story boutique hotel next to Harry Reid International Airport (formerly McCarran Field) is scheduled to begin construction in 2022 for an opening in 2024.\n\nAstral Hotels planned to start building Astral, a 34-story, 620-room hotel and casino on the southern Las Vegas Strip, but the project is delayed. \n\nThe All Net Resort & Arena was scheduled to break ground in October 2021. It will include a 23,000 seat retractable roof arena, two hotels and a theatre.\n\nTransportation\n\nBuses \nRTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) provides bus service on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between Mandalay Bay at the southern end of the Strip (and to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South Strip Transfer Terminal after midnight) to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino. RTC also operates an express bus called the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). This route connects the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and Downtown Las Vegas to the north, with stops at selected hotels and shopping attractions (Las Vegas Premium Outlets North & South).\n\nTrams \nSeveral free trams operate between properties on the west side of the Strip:\n\nMonorail \nWhile not on the Strip itself, the Las Vegas Monorail runs a 3.9 mile route on the east side of the Strip corridor from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Avenue, with stops every 4 to 8 minutes at several on-Strip properties including the MGM Grand and the Sahara at each end of the route.  The stations include:\n\n SAHARA Las Vegas Station\n Westgate Station\n Las Vegas Convention Center Station\n Harrah's/The LINQ Station\n Flamingo/Caesars Palace Station\n Bally's/Paris Station\n MGM Grand Station\n\nThe monorail began operations in 1995 and originally used two trains from Walt Disney World.  In 2021, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) announced plans for purchasing the bankrupt Las Vegas Monorail.\n\nPedestrian traffic\n\nOn a daily basis, there are tens of thousands of pedestrians walking along the Strip at any one time. As of 2019, the daily number of pedestrians on the Strip is approximately 50,000.\n\nConcerning pedestrian safety and to help alleviate traffic congestion at popular intersections, several pedestrian footbridges were erected in 1990s and the first was the Tropicana \u2013 Las Vegas Boulevard footbridge. Some feature designs that match the theme of the nearby resorts.  Additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard.  The footbridges include:\n\n Veer Towers:. Connects Veer Towers, Waldorf Astoria, and Crystals Shopping Center\n Park MGM and T-Mobile Arena Park: Connects MGM and Showcase Mall\n Planet Hollywood: Connects Planet Hollywood, CityCenter, Crystals Shopping Center, and The Cosmopolitan.\n Spring Mountain Road and Las Vegas Blvd. Corner: Connects Treasure Island, The Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, and The Venetian\n Flamingo Road and Las Vegas Blvd. Corner: Connects Bally's, Flamingo, Bellagio, and Caesars Palace\n Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana Ave Corner. Connects the MGM Grand, New York-New York, Excalibur, and Tropicana\n\nThere has been negative feedback from pedestrians about the elevated crosswalks due to need to walk as much as a quarter-mile to reach an intersection to cross the street and to then walk back some distance on the other side of the street to get to their desired destinations.\n\nAfter a driver drove into pedestrians on the sidewalk in front of Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood in December 2015, 800 bollards began to be installed on Las Vegas Blvd. starting in 2017.  The construction of the bollards resulted in the removal of 49 of the 82 stars of the Las Vegas Walk of Stars.  In 2019, the bollards on Las Vegas Blvd. were shortened due to feedback from drivers that the bollards were obstructing street views.  283 of the 4,500 bollards will be shortened from 54 inches to 36 inches.  The shortened bollards line 20 different driveways.\n\nStudies conducted by Clark County in 2012 and 2015 identified issues with congestion.  The studies resulted in $5 million of improvements, including LED lights, ADA ramps, containment fencing, widening sidewalks, and removing permanent obstructions, such as signs, signposts, trash cans, and fire hydrants.  The studies also identified non-permanent obstructions causing congestion, such as street performers, vendors, handbillers, signholders, and illegal street gambling.  Modifications to non-obstruction zones and increased enforcement were implemented in order to reduce congestion.\n\nTaxis \n\nTaxis are available at resorts, shopping centers, attractions, and for scheduled pickups.  The Nevada Taxicab Authority provides information about taxi fares and fare zones.  In 2021, there has been an increase in taxi passengers due to declines in rideshare drivers and rideshare surge pricing.\n\nRideshares \nRideshare services, including Uber and Lyft, are available on the Strip.  In 2021, there have been reports of a lack of rideshare drivers and longer wait times due to job changes, concerns about the pandemic, and the pause in surge pricing due to the state of emergency declared by the State of Nevada.\n\nAttractions on the Strip\n\nGambling \n\nIn 2019, about eight in ten (81%) visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas, the highest proportion in the past five years. The average time spent gambling, 2.7 hours, represents an increase over the past three years. Also, the average trip gambling budget, $591.06, was increased from 2018.

The Tropicana Country Club closed in 1990 and the Dunes golf course in the mid-90s. Steve Wynn, founder of previously owned Mirage Resorts, purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company Wynn Resorts and redeveloped the course as the Wynn Golf Club.

Untouched, undisturbed food is donated to local food banks.\nEnergy efficiency: Hotels have updated appliances in rooms, installed LED lighting, and installed wireless lighting control systems.\n\nRenewable energy is generated and used on the Strip. MGM initiated solar power when it built a solar array on top of the Mandalay Bay in 2014 and expanded it in 2016.  The solar array at the Mandalay Bay, a 28-acre system capable of powering 1,300 homes, is one of the largest commercial rooftop solar arrays in the United States.  The solar array includes more than 26,000 solar panels capable of providing a total of 8.3 megawatts DC (6.5 megawatts AC), sufficient for powering 25% of the Mandalay Bay campus.\n\nEnergy-efficient buildings are also being implemented and the Strip has one of the highest concentrations of LEED-certified buildings in the world.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wazir Ali\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Syed Wazir Ali (; 15 September 1903 \u2013 17 June 1950) was a prominent figure in early Indian cricket. He was a right-handed batsman and a medium pace bowler.\n\nEarly life\n\nWazir played in all the Tests that India played before the second world war. In the tour of England in 1932, he scored 1229 runs in first class matches and 1725 overall. In the next tour in 1936 he was hampered by a hand injury but recorded his highest score of 42 in the Test at Manchester.\n\nFirst class cricket\nWazir was educated at Aligarh Muslim University. He made his first-class debut, aged 19, for Muslims against Sikhs at Lawrence Gardens (now Bagh-e-Jinnah), Lahore in the 1922-23 Lahore Tournament. \nFor most of his first class career he played for Southern Punjab in the Ranji Trophy and Muslims in the Bombay Pentangular. His unbeaten 222 in the 1938/39 Ranji final against Bengal was then the highest in the tournament. Bengal had earlier been all out for 222, but Southern Punjab still ended up in the losing side. His career best score of 268 not out for Indian University Occasionals in 1935 was the highest score in Indian first class cricket. Both records were beaten by Vijay Hazare's undefeated 316 in 1939/40.\n\nAs a cricketing figure, Wazir Ali was second only to C.K. Nayudu among his contemporary Indian cricketers but he apparently resented it having to play second fiddle to Nayudu. Nayudu had many rivals and Wazir was often a stalking-horse for them. Mihir Bose contrasted the two: \"To an extent Nayudu and Wazir Ali were natural rivals. Wazir, like Nayudu, was a powerful right-hand bat who could play some very elegant strokes including a charming cover drive, and he was also a more than useful medium-pace change bowler. Like Nayudu he played in only seven Tests, all against England, and did not have the opportunity to demonstrate his class or his ability to its full extent. What set the two men apart was that Wazir, eight years younger than Nayudu, did not possess the older man's determination and his obsession with the game. Nayudu was, undoubtedly the greater cricketer, and he left a deeper impression on the game \u2026 Wazir in contrast, died at the age of forty-six after an operation for appendicitis just three years after Pakistan was created, and he had little chance to impose his personality of the post-war game in that country.\n\nWazir captained India in two unofficial Tests against an Australian XI in 1935/36. Nayudu had captained the side in the first two matches of the series and dropped out of the matches in which Wazir captained the side. \"Wazir went to his grave nursing a deep grievance against Nayudu\", though it seems that Nayudu was genuinely unable to play.\n\nLater life\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Wazir migrated to Pakistan and ended his life in poverty. Cashman quotes a Pakistani official that \"during his last days, Wazir lived precariously on his own meagre savings in a small quarters in Soldiers Bazar where he struggled against poverty and disease\".\n\nHis son Khalid Wazir played two Tests for Pakistan in 1954. Wazir was the elder brother of Nazir Ali.\n\nReferences\n\nCited sources\nMihir Bose (1990) A History of Indian Cricket, Andre Deutsch,\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nIndia Test cricketers\n1903 births\n1950 deaths\nCricketers from Jalandhar\nIndian cricketers\nMuslims cricketers\nSouthern Punjab cricketers\nSindh cricketers\nCentral India cricketers\nPatiala cricketers\nNorthern India cricketers\nIndian emigrants to Pakistan", "machine_text": " Wazir Ali (born 3 February 1968) is an Indian athlete who specialized in the 400 metres event. He won several medals at major international events, the most famous being the silver medal at the 1986 Asian Games. He also competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics and is a five-time national champion in 400m. At the young age of 19, Wazir Ali set the national 400m record twice in rapid succession in 1985; first at the National Open Athletics Championships, then again at the Delhi Federation Cup. As a result of his achievements, he was selected to represent India at the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul, South Korea. He won a silver medal in the 400m event, smashing the Asian Games record with a time of 45.67 seconds. He became the first Indian athlete in 50 years to win a medal in the 400m event, the last being Milkha Singh who won a bronze medal in the 1938 Asian Games. He also took part in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where he was the first Indian athlete to reach the semi-finals of the 400m event. In 1988, he was awarded the Arjuna Award, India's highest sporting honour, for his achievements in athletics. In 1989, he set the 400m national record with a time of 45.17 seconds, a time he maintained till his retirement in 1992. Following his retirement, Wazir Ali focused on coaching and served as an assistant coach at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hanky Panky (Madonna song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American recording artist Madonna from her soundtrack album I'm Breathless. It was released on June 12, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from a line in the parent film, Dick Tracy, talking about a woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, \"Hanky Panky\" is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke.\n\nThe song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting its lyrical content. It was a commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours: Blond Ambition (1990) and Re-Invention (2004). The song has been covered by several tribute acts and was also performed on the television series Ally McBeal (1997).\n\nBackground and release\nIn 1990, Madonna starred in the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney\u2014a new role introduced for her\u2014with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs written by Stephen Sondheim for the film\u2014\"Sooner or Later\", \"More\" and \"What Can You Lose\"\u2014which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. \"I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel\", she said at the time.\n\nMadonna recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. \"Hanky Panky\" was written and produced by Madonna and Leonard and was released as the second and final single from I'm Breathless on June 12, 1990. The cassette and the 7-inch versions had \"More\", another song from the album as its B-side, while the 12-inch releases had two remixes of the song by Kevin Gilbert. Cover photograph for the single was done by Patrick Demarchelier with Jeri Heiden designing the sleeves.\n\nRecording and composition\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was recorded within the three weeks time taken for the whole project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centred around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a \"good spanking\". It is performed in an almost comical style and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, \"You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me\". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm\u2013C\u2013Bm\u2013A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm\u2013A\u2013B9\u2013A7\u2013Dm\u2013C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained:\nThe spanking thing started because I believed that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around with people like Al Pacino's character. Warren [Beatty] asked me to write some songs, and one of them\u2014the hanky-panky song\u2014was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle, I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.\nThe singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line \"I'll settle for the back of your hand\"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song \"highly dangerous\" while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was \"extremely harmful\". Although initially approving of the idea of \"getting spanked\"\u2014even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show\u2014Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.\n\nCritical response\n\nJ. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that \"the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply sounds like a silly innocent romp until you realize what she's going on and on is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!\". The author also felt Madonna sang with \"just a little too much authority\". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it \"a comic hymn to spanking\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a \"double entendre-laden hit\". Bill Coleman from Billboard called it a \"steamy and suggestive jumpin' jive\". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted \"Hanky Panky\" as one of the best tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a \"fake period piece\" but praising its \"risqu\u00e9 s&m-lite\" sound as \"all her\". Ernest Hardy from Cash Box said it \"is a tribute to the pleasures of light S&M, done in a brassy '30s style. Madonna sings in a lower key than ususal, tosses off risque lines, and heads for the top of the charts with barely an effort.\" David Giles from Music Week stated that it \"finds Madonna flirting in a big way with Forties swing music.\" He added, \"Pure Hollywood stuff\". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside \"Cry Baby\" and \"I'm Going Bananas\", was one of the \"more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco\" on the album. He also noted that \"its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour.\" People magazine called it a \"paean to kink\". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it \"goofy (but catchy!)\". In August 2018, Joel Lynch from the same magazine ranked it as the singer's 100th greatest song, calling it an \"enjoyably (and cartoonishly) amorous big-band swing song\" and comparing Madonna's vocals to Betty Boop. Greg Sandow, from Entertainment Weekly, called it a \"delightful challenge to censorship\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt it was a  \"cheeky\" song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s. \n\nStephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a \"big-band blues [song] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage\". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described \"Hanky Panky\" as \"naughty\", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song \"Makin' Whoopee\" by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that \"one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when you push her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' is one of the few pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking.\" For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"it gets points for its boldness and audacity. Yet it never truly rises above its novelty status\". Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B. King believed that the subject matter of \"Hanky Panky\" would surely receive \"flank\", but defended Madonna saying that she had been singing about such topics for years by then.\nThe Huffington Post ranked the song fifth on their list of \"The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs\"; author Pandora Boxx hailed it as \"a great fusion of '90s pop and vintage '30s\", but noted that \"its 'scandalous' subject matter ruffled too many feathers to make it a big hit\". Also from The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs ranked it at number 55 on his list of \"The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles\", calling it \"pure fun, '30s swing style [...] its lyrics are sillier than they ought to be, but the fabulous beat refuses to let your dancing shoes collect dust\". Writing for Gay Star News, Joe Morgan gave a mixed review, calling it \"less sexual and feminist liberation and more corny and blatant [...] A forgettable number that sounds like track six of a musical theatre cast album\". A negative review came from Royal S. Brown, author of Film Musings: A Selected Anthology from Fanfare Magazine, who called it \"ridiculous\". Also negative was The Guardians Jude Rogers, who wrote that \"even creators of brilliant pop can go wrong\", calling it \"over farty\" and \"Madonna's nadir\".\n\nChart performance\nFollowing its release, \"Hanky Panky\" was initially blacklisted at some radio stations when they faced objections from audiences about the lyrical content. Nevertheless, it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 40 the week of June 30, 1990, as \"Vogue\" was descending from the top ten. The single quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number ten the week of July 28, 1990. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 19, 1990, for shipments of 500,000 copies. Billboard ranked it at number 36 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 92 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 18 on the week of September 1, 1990. It was present for a total of 13 weeks on the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and after two weeks, reached its peak of number two the week of July 27, 1990; spent a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on August 1, 1990, for shipments of 200,000 copies. According to the Official Charts Company, the single has sold over 210,000 copies as of October 2010. In Australia, \"Hanky Panky\" debuted at number 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of July 29, 1990, and peaked at number six four weeks later. It was ranked at number 45 on the ARIA year-end chart. In New Zealand, the single debuted at number 23 on RIANZ Singles Chart and, after fluctuating for the next three weeks, reached a peak of number six, becoming Madonna's 18th top-ten single in the country. In the European nations, \"Hanky Panky\" reached the top-ten of the charts in Ireland, as well as topping the charts in Finland. In other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, it managed to peak within the top 20 of the charts.\n\nLive performances and covers\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was first performed on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song dressed in a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer, standing in front of a microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: \"You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?\". Regarding the \"shameless promotion\" of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that \"along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show\". Two different performances  were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.\n\nFourteen years later, Madonna performed an energetic showgirl themed version of \"Hanky Panky\" as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. She appeared onstage dressed in a circus themed outfit, consisting of black hot pants, red high heels, headband and a red and white striped 1920s flapper  style bustier. Sean Piccoli, from the Sun-Sentinel, praised the singer's ability to \"summon the vampy humor of 'Hanky Panky'\u2014a Bette Midler moment if ever [Madonna] had one\". In May 2000, the song was performed by actress Alicia Witt on the third-season finale of the American television series Ally McBeal, titled \"The Musical, Almost\". An Indie cover version by the band Killer Nannies In America, was included on the 2000 tribute album The Material Girl: A Tribute to Madonna. The Gary Tesca Orchestra included an instrumental version of the song on their album Who's That Girl: The Madonna Story, Vol. 1 (2006).\n\nTrack listings and formats\n\nUS and European 7-inch single; Japanese 3-inch CD single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (LP version)\u00a0\u2013 3:57\n \"More\" (LP version)\u00a0\u2013 4:59\n\nAustralian, European, and US 12-inch single and CD maxi-single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix)\u00a0\u2013 6:34\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix)\u00a0\u2013 3:50\n \"More\" (album version)\u00a0\u2013 4:59\n\nDigital single (2020)\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix)\u00a0\u2013 3:50\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix)\u00a0\u2013 6:36\n \"More\" (LP version)\u00a0\u2013 4:59\n\nCredits and personnel\n Madonna\u00a0\u2013 writer, vocals, producer\n Patrick Leonard\u00a0\u2013 writer, producer, keyboard\n Jeff Porcaro\u00a0\u2013 drums\n Guy Pratt\u00a0\u2013 bass\n Donna De Lory\u00a0\u2013 background vocals\n Niki Haris\u00a0\u2013 background vocals\n N'Dea Davenport\u00a0\u2013 background vocals\n Kevin McGuilbert\u00a0\u2013 remix and additional production\n Patrick Demarchelier\u00a0\u2013 cover photographer\n Jeri Heiden\u00a0\u2013 designer\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications and sales\n\nSee also\nList of European number-one airplay songs of the 1990s\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\"Hanky Panky\" on Spotify\n\n1990 singles\nMadonna (entertainer) songs\nSongs about BDSM\nSongs written by Madonna (entertainer)\nSongs written by Patrick Leonard\nSong recordings produced by Madonna (entertainer)\nSong recordings produced by Patrick Leonard\nVocal jazz songs\nNumber-one singles in Finland\n1990 songs\nSwing music\nMusic controversies\nAmerican jazz songs\nSire Records singles\nWarner Records singles", "machine_text": " \"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American pop singer Madonna, released as the fifth and final single from her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray, and was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records. It topped the singles chart in Finland and New Zealand, while peaking in the top 5 in the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom. \"Hanky Panky\" is an upbeat dance-pop song with elements of R&B music. The song garnered positive reviews from critics, who commended its production and sound. Commercially, thesingle experienced success mainly in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Finland, where it topped the chart. The single's accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, features Madonna performing a choreographed dance routine in the streets of Miami with a troupe of female back-up dancers. Madonna performed the song on the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987), Re-Invention World Tour (2004) and Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008). In 1985, Madonna was recording songs for her third studio album, True Blue. To complete it, she enlisted the help of producers and writers, including Stephen Bray. Madonna wrote the song inspired by the song \"Willie and the Hand Jive\", released by Johnny Otis in 1958. She stated, \"I thought about doing something like that for a long time...maybe a lot of people joined in and did that kind of a song and dance when it came out. It was just a song that I wanted to hear, basically. I wanted it to be something that people could dance to that was just a little bit naughty on the surface but had a lot of heart\". Bray and Madonna wrote the song, while Bray produced it and contributed with instruments. Bray recalled the session in which the two pieces of music were connected together and formed the song. He stated: \u201cAt the end of the day, we stitched together two different pieces of music to make \"Hanky Panky\". I think it was one of the first times we were both actually in the studio at the same time, rather than me supplying the music and her writing lyrics and singing. The single was released worldwide on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records. It was released as 12-inch record format and a cassette. \"Hanky Panky\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics; praising it for its production and sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from All Music Guide called it \u201can undiscovered gem that should have found her a few more hit singles\". According to him, \"Hanky Panky\" was one of the best singles form True Blue. Stephen Holden from The New York Times called it irresistible and praised Madonna for her \"irresistibly arresting\" vocals. The song experienced success mainly in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Finland, where it topped the chart, with the latter two listing it as the best single of the year. In United States, the song peaKed at number three on Billboard Hot 100. It was placed at number seven on the Billboard's best-selling singles of 1987 chart. In the United Kingdom, it reached number four on UK Singles Chart. The single's accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, premiered in July 1987. It features Madonna and a group of female backup dancers performing a choreographed dance routine in the streets and alleys in Miami. At the beginning of the clip, Madonna and the dancers are seen dancing and singing to \"Hanky Panky\" on a street corner. The clip uses lightning and smoke effects to punctuate the performance. Throughout the video, Madonna appears in a black outfit, incorporating a mesh corset, with a red hat, earrings and necklaces.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3732808}

He was born in Verona, New York, and graduated from Hobart College in 1891. After traveling and teaching in the Melanesian Archipelago, he became superintendent and director of the London Missionary Society's South Seas evangelistic enterprise in 1902. He is credited with establishing the foundation for one of the largest and most successful missions in that region. Codding was sent to the South Seas by the London Missionary Society in 1895, where he spent the rest of his life working to bring the Gospel to the heathen over an immense range of islands known as Melanesia. During the span of his ministry in the region he planted over 160 churches and ordained 430 native pastors. He recorded more than one thousand names on his family register. The custom of head-hunting, common among the islanders at the time of Codding's arrival, was replaced by Christian worship services during his time there. He also popularized the phrase \"sons of Solomon\", which became the nickname of the islanders. In recognition of his missionary spirit, Codding was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the University of Edinburgh in 1926 and the Order of the British Empire in 1928. In addition to his Christian message, Codding was a great social reformer and wrote numerous books and articles on Melanesian society. He wrote largely of his trials and tribulations as a missionary and his experiences in the \"island world\" as a form of cultural documentation. His works include: \"Things Seen in the South Seas\" and \"Light in the Islands\". Codding returned to California shortly before his death and is interred in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. He had been a lifelong friend of the Roosevelt family, who attended his funeral. After his death, his widow, Ethel, hired a sculptor to create a bronze statue of Codding in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Codding is remembered today for his pioneering work in the South Seas. He helped to bring the Gospel to the regions of the Pacific islands, establishing educational and medical facilities, building churches and helping to reform island culture. His impact on the region can still be seen today in the islanders\u2019 reverence for Christianity and the deep religious faith they practice. Codding will always be remembered as a great missionary, whose life and work left an indelible mark in the islands he visited.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7425688}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Continuous duty overnight\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Continuous duty overnights (CDOs) are also referred to as \"stand-ups\", \"naps\", or \"high-speeds\" is a scheduling practice used in regional airline operations to circumvent, or \"outsmart\" government flight crew minimum rest requirements. A few major airlines may also use them.\n\nA crew working a CDO will generally operate the last flight out at night, have on duty time on the ground (anywhere from 0\u20138 hours) at the destination and then operate the first flight back in the morning. Since the break between flights is not sufficient to qualify as a free from duty rest period, the crewmembers remain continuously on duty, even though they may have been provided with a hotel room for rest. Crew members would normally require a specific amount of resting hours in between shifts based on their countries and airlines but by using the term continuous duty, they are able to go beyond the specified rest period due to being on duty.\nAnother factor is delays. Because of this set up; delays taken throughout the day that result in a delay the last flight (first flight of a CDO) do not impact the first flight the next day. It would simply reduce the amount of time the crew are on the ground.\n\nThe continuous duty overnight schedule could be flown 3\u20135 times consecutively (i.e., back-to-back).\n\nExamples\nFlight crew report to the airport at 2040 (8:40\u00a0pm), which means the crew will have to arrive earlier to park, clear airport security, and get to their operations office to check in. Then they would fly from 2147 to 0037 (2-hour, 50-minute flight). Once at their destination they have 6 hours 13 minutes on the ground. In that time they have to ride to and check in (about 20 minutes) at the hotel. They would get to their hotel room about 0100 and have to be awake at 0530 (30 minutes to get ready) for the 0600 shuttle to the airport, leaving the crew about 4 hours and 30 minutes of \u201crest\u201d. A 0650 departure and 2-hour, 18-minute return trip gets them to the gate at 0908. After unloading they would be released (still at the aircraft) at 0923. That is a total of 12 hours and 43 minutes on duty, and 5 hours and 8 minutes of flying.\nFlight crew report at 2100, fly from 2200 to 2300, \"stand-up\" on duty overnight from 2315 to 0515, then fly 0600 to 0700, followed by a rest period from 0700 to 1700. The flight crew would then report at 1700, fly 1800 to 1900, \"stand-up\" on duty 1915 to 0115, and then fly 0200 to 0300. This example involves only one-hour flights, which are less than the times and number of segments that might typically be flown.\n\nOther issues\nSome crews are not provided a hotel by their airline or want to make the most of their time on the ground and resort to sleeping on board in the crew rest compartment or other rest facility. Pilots take off their ties and hang up their shirts. \"You don't want to look unprofessional after sleeping in an aircraft,\" another pilot said. \"There are some people that bring sleeping bags and pillows and their own blankets so they don't have to use the airline blankets.\" In airline slang, this is called 'a camp out.'\n\nIncidents & Accidents from CDOs\nRunway incursion at Cleveland Hopkins International\n\nRunway incursion at Baltimore-Washington International Airport\n\nBroke 10,000 speed restriction near DTW\n\nTakeoff from the wrong runway at La Crosse\n\nCrew taxied to the incorrect runway at Jacksonville\n\nLow altitude on an ILS approach at Akron-Canton\n\nTakeoff without clearance at Cincinnati\n\nTakeoff in the wrong aircraft at La Crosse\n\nTakeoff without required fuel at Atlanta\n\nLined up to land on the wrong runway at Chicago O'Hare\n\nRunway incursion at Dallas Fort Worth\n\nTakeoff in the wrong aircraft in Denver\n\nRunway incursion at Kalamazoo\n\nReferences\n\nAviation safety", "machine_text": " Continuous duty overnight is a phrase typically used to describe working overnight at a job. In such cases, the person who is working will have a continuous shift, typically lasting 8 to 12 hours, and will need to stay on the job through the night, unless they are given permission to take a rest period by their employer. Usually, a shift of this nature will require the worker to remain alert and stay focused throughout the night in order to do their job properly. In recent years, more and more employers have begun offering jobs that require continuous duty overnight shifts. This is done in order to help the employers maximize their profits and reduce the need for additional daytime or weekend shifts. For example, a call center may require its workers to work overnight shifts in order to better serve customers, as calls may come in at any time and need to be answered in order to keep customers satisfied. In addition, an airline may also require its pilots and other flight staff to continuously remain on duty overnight in order to ensure customer safety and satisfaction with their flights. Besides customer service and safety, another motivating factor for employers to offer continuous duty overnight shifts is the potential cost savings that can be achieved. By having job positions continuously staffed, employers can avoid having to pay for overtime for additional shifts or hire additional staff, resulting in considerable cost savings. Continuous overnight shifts can be physically and mentally demanding, as they require a person to remain awake and alert during unpredictable hours while also requiring a certain level of mental focus and efficiency. This can be especially challenging, when combined with the other responsibilities that a person may have in their personal life such as raising their family or managing their own finances. To ensure the safety, efficiency, and well-being of a worker on a continuous overnight shift, employers may provide certain benefits such as extra pay and time-off to alleviate some of the stress. Although the concept of a continuous overnight shift may seem daunting, it does have its advantages. One of the most notable advantages is that a continuous overnight shift will usually result in increased financial rewards due to the extra hours worked, with the possibility of overtime depending on the situation. In addition, because such shifts typically require a high level of focus and attention, the experience gained by working in a continuous overnight shift can be valuable in the long run and may provide useful skills for a person's future endeavors.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18363669}

The show is hosted by Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky and co-hosted by Dr. Jonathan Arden. Autopsy featured real-life cases where investigators dissected the bodies of people who died mysteriously in order to determine the cause of death. Autopsy premiered on Discovery Life Channel on October 30, 2009. It was an hour-long show divided into two parts: an initial scene-setting introduction and a more in-depth investigation of the case. In each episode, forensic pathologists traveled to the scene of the death and interviewed family, friends, law enforcement, and medical personnel. They then conducted an on-camera autopsy in two parts: an external examination of the body and an internal in-depth dissection of the body to determine the cause of death. Whenever the cause of death wasn't immediately apparent, the pathologists had to draw on their expertise and knowledge to make a determination. During the course of the investigation, they relied on toxicology reports, microscopic studies, and lab tests to help them reach their conclusions. The most important tool in the Autopsy kit is its on-site forensic lab. There, the forensic pathologists have all the necessary equipment at their disposal, including a digital scale, an X-ray machine, a pH meter, and more. In order to efficiently carry out the investigation and clearly explain the results, the show brings along a number of special guests, including medical experts, criminalists, and law enforcement professionals. Autopsy is unique in its ability to show viewers the science behind determining cause of death, uncovering secrets along the way. It also brings attention to the importance of forensic pathologists and powerfully reveals the impact of sudden and unexpected death on families and communities. The show ended in 2016 after seven seasons and 112 episodes. In 2017, the Discovery Life Channel re-aired some of the episodes of Autopsy for several weeks. In 2018, the show was picked up and remastered for broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5870897}

In the early days of Spectrum Scientific, design and manufacturing was conducted solely by Wiggins with backing and most funding being provided by Don Woodward at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and the National Institutes of Health.  In 1988, the original Multichannel Data Acquisition system (abbreviated as MAP or \"Harvey box\") was developed and uses hardware filtering of data signals.  The replacement for the MAP, the Omniplex system, was released in 2009 and replaces the hardware filtering components with filtering in software. Due to many contributions like these, Plexon and Harvey Wiggins have become iconic in the neuroscience community.  Dr. Regina Carelli, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, describes Harvey as \"wonderful--A scientist much more than a salesman.\"\n\nSpectrum Scientific became known as Plexon in 1996.

It runs along the rivers Saint-Charles and du Berger between Saint-Charles Lake and port of Qu\u00e9bec. It has a 32 km footpath and a 8 km cycle path on Rivi\u00e8re-Saint-Charles Corridor.\n\nPortrait\n\nDevelopment \n\nThe park was inaugurated on September 17, 2008 under the name Parc linear de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles. Its development is linked to the depollution and redevelopment of the river banks which, in total, required investments of $160 million by the government of Canada, that of Quebec, the City of Quebec, as well as the Quebec Wildlife Foundation which provided a contribution of 300 000 dollars.\n\nThese works consisted of the removal of 8 km of concrete shoreline, the creation of  of wildlife habitat including the planting of 600 hardwood and coniferous trees, 1500 shrubs and 20000 herbaceous plants, construction of 14 retention basins to prevent excess wastewater from ending up in the river during heavy rains. The objective of this work undertaken in 1996 was to renaturalize the banks in order to allow the return of aquatic avian fauna and to withdraw from the Saint-Charles River its title of the most polluted river in Canada. The development of the walking path itself will have cost nine million dollars and the renaturalization of the shores will be carried out at a cost of 25 million. These successful works allow the reappearance of various species that were no longer found there such as the cormorant or the great blue heron.\n\nThe inauguration day, despite the rain, 280 walkers participated in the activities, offering different routes on the trails and a traditional Wendat show in Wendake. Starting in 2010, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles will add to their traditional canoeing of the river hiking activities on the linear park trail for the 14th edition of the F\u00eate de la Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles.\n\nCourse \nThe linear park covers the entire length of the river, from its mouth at Lake Saint-Charles to its mouth at Port de Qu\u00e9bec.

This section is characterized by the rapids and the falls that the river crosses, as well as by the accessible activities (Interpretation center of the park of Kabir Kouba waterfall, sports activities in Chauveau park).\n\nFive kilometers separate Chauveau Park and Parc Les Saules. This houses the Maison O'Neill, an ancestral house which has become a center for exhibitions and shows, and surrounded by gardens open to visitors. The following five kilometers make it possible to reach the borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou and Saint-Charles cemetery, by crossing the mouth of the Berger river, within Duberger park also comprising a part of the linear park on its banks. The park then covers the two banks of the Saint-Charles river through several parks, including Victoria Park, Pointe-aux-Li\u00e8vres Park and Cartier-Br\u00e9beuf National Historic Site. The natural sand islands of the Place du marais are ideal for bird watching. The trail ends at the port of Quebec, at the mouth of the Saint-Charles river on the Saint-Laurent river. The last section of 4 km on each bank is designed to accommodate cyclists and users of inline skates\n\nThree sites allow the descent of canoes or kayaks on the river from the linear park. Audio guides offer a guided hike between Maison O'Neill and Maison Dorion-Coulombe. In winter, 27 kilometers (2011) of trails are groomed by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles to allow walking on snow.\n\nPublic art \nThe section between Samson bridge and Scott bridge presents ten works of art by the Quebec artist of origin Vietnamese Truong Chanh Trung representing species of birds frequenting the river: ring-billed gull, double-crested cormorant, white pigeon, blackbird, two-colored swallow, great blue heron, mallard, kildir plover, black duck and kingfisher. These bronze sculptures are erected on top of old lamppost casks to light them up at night.

During the nineties, two Parliamentary Committees were established.\nThe Kashmir Committee comprising 31 members, is one of the most important parliamentary bodies, and the slot of its chairman goes to a seasoned and respected politician. In the past, stalwarts like Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar Khan and Ch. Hamid Nasir Chattha held this important position. Because of the importance of the issue, when the Parliament was not in position the former president Pervez Musharraf also formulated a National Kashmir Committee headed by the Kashmir veteran leader Sardar Abdul Qayyum.\n\nThe first one, comprising 24 members (MNAs: 21 & Senators: 3) was headed by late Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, MNA (December, 1993 \u2013 November, 1996); whereas the second, with 26 members (MNAs) was led by late Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar Khan, MNA (May, 1997 \u2013 October, 1999).

It was formed in August 2019, following a series of clashes that had broken out between India and Pakistan over the disputed region. The committee is chaired by Rajya Sabha MP K. V. Thomas, leader of the Indian National Congress, and consists of members from both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. The primary role of the panel is to examine the current political situation of Kashmir, as well as make recommendations to the Government about possible solutions to the problem. The panel is divided into a number of sub-committees, each of which is tasked with a specific area to investigate. These sub-committees include, but are not limited to, investigating the prevailing security and law and order situation in the Valley, socioeconomic development and opportunity, internal and external communication and interfaith dialogue, health and sanitation. Apart from these investigations, the committee is also tasked with formulating proposals to the Government of India to be implemented in Kashmir in order to bring about a peaceful resolution to the dispute. The committee will look into the views of local residents in order to assess the current issues in the region and the opinions they hold. According to the Indian Government, the committee is an effort to \"involve those most affected by the situation in finding a solution\". The Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir is due to present its findings to the Indian Government by the end of 2019. The recommendations that it makes are expected to serve as the basis for any decisions the Government makes in regards to the future of Kashmir. The findings of the committee are also expected to be shared with international organisations such as the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir is seen as a positive move towards finding a lasting resolution to the conflict in Kashmir. It is hoped that the committee's recommendations will be taken seriously by the Indian Government and help bring peace to the region.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24564186}

In 2009, Tony Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership spill 42 votes to 41 in the second round and took on the role of Opposition Leader.\n\nThe Abbott shadow ministry was the first in which shadow ministers received additional pay for their roles, taking effect from 2012 after a decision of the Gillard government.\n\nStructure \nThe \"opposition front bench\" comprises the full shadow ministry including the shadow cabinet, other shadow ministers and shadow parliamentary secretaries.\nAs an institution, the shadow cabinet is much less defined\u2014or studied\u2014than the Cabinet with its well established formal procedures. Shadow Cabinet operates more as a committee of an opposition political party than an institution of Government or Parliament. The Cabinet Handbook was first published in 1926 and the updated version is available on-line but no such equivalent exists for Shadow Cabinet.\n\nFirst arrangement (2009\u20132010) \nThe Shadow Cabinet of Tony Abbott was created following the accession of Tony Abbott to the leadership in December 2009. It remained largely unchanged until the 2010 election, excluding one minor reshuffle in March 2010. After this reshuffle, Barnaby Joyce gained the Regional Development portfolio from Warren Truss and the Infrastructure and Water Portfolio from Ian Macfarlane.

It was in government from 2013 to 2015 and then at the end of 2014 changed to the 44th ministry. The Shadow Ministry was made of several prominent members of the ALP, including some of its senior executive figures, such as Treasurer Joe Hockey, Deputy Leader Julie Bishop, Shadow Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt, Shadow Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Immigration Spokesman Scott Morrison. The Shadow Ministry of Tony Abbott was responsible for overseeing the policies and activities of the ALP in opposition to the Liberal-National Coalition government in 2013 and 2014. It also was responsible for developing and pursuing an alternative strategy for its policy areas. The Shadow Ministry played a crucial role in the ALP's electoral campaign in 2013 and 2014, by outlining policies to counter government initiatives and outlining opposition policies to win over swing voters in the 2013 Australian federal election. The Shadow Ministry under Abbott was considered to be a more moderate version of the ALP than it had become in the wake of its 2007 election loss, with Abbott considered to be a more centrist leader than previous ALP leader Kevin Rudd. Abbott appointed several prominent figures to his Shadow Ministry, including former National Party leader Barnaby Joyce as Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, and former Deputy Prime Minister Julie Bishop as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Shadow Ministry's primary objective was to develop a strategy to oppose and challenge the policies of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government. Abbott managed to win the federal election of 2013, allowing the ALPs to move into government in September 2013. After the election, the Shadow Ministry was disbanded, with the new ALP Government taking control of all policies and activities in government. The Shadow Ministry of Tony Abbott was unique in Opposition politics and ultimately paved the way for the ALP's victory in the election of 2013. Though it was undoubtedly a difficult period in Opposition politics for the ALP, the Shadow Ministry was ultimately critical in securing the party's success in election and allowing it to move back into government with Abbott as Prime Minister.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 849996}

He spent a number of years at the end of his life as an agent of New France among the Miami.\n\nVincennes was born in Quebec on 19 January 1668. His father, tanner Fran\u00e7ois Byssot de la Rivi\u00e8re, was granted a seigniory for his tannery on the St. Lawrence River in 1672. Later, he became a ward of his brother-in-law, Louis Joliet, who entered him in the seminary at Quebec.\n\nVincennes married Marguerite Forestier in Montreal in 1696. They had four daughters and three sons, including Fran\u00e7ois-Marie.\n\nThrough the efforts of his godfather, Jean Baptiste Talon, he secured a commission as ensign in the French marine. In 1696, the Comte de Frontenac appointed him as commander of the French outposts southeast of Lake Michigan (in present-day northeastern Indiana). Here he became good friends with the Miami people, settling first at the St. Joseph River, and, in 1704, establishing a trading post and fort at Kekionga, the location of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The same year, the current governor-general of New France, Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, wrote the French court to emphasize the importance of Bissot's services to New France among the Miami people.\n\nIn 1712, Vincennes served as second in command at Fort Detroit. In this position, he resided with the Miami to keep them from falling under the control of the British.  He helped defeat the forces of the Fox Nation and acquired a young Fox slave, whom he named Fran\u00e7ois-Michel. This slave eventually was owned by his son, Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Bissot.\n\nHe died in 1719 at Kekionga and was succeeded by his son as commander of the French in Miami country.  After his death, a permanent garrison was established in the Maumee River area by Jacques-Charles Renaud Dubuisson.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\n1668 births\n1719 deaths\nCanadian explorers\nFrench Quebecers\nPeople of New France", "machine_text": " Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes (1668\u20131719) was a French explorer and fur trader who played an important role in opening up the interior of the North American continent to the French and British. Born in Vincennes, France (now part of Paris), Bissot was orphaned at a young age, and taken under the care of his relatives, the Bissot de Vincennes. At the age of seventeen, Bissot enlisted in the French army and took part in the Siege of Lille in 1667. Afterwards, he followed his brothers out to North America to join in the fur trade. He quickly became known throughout the French colonies as an experienced woodsman, able to traverse densely wooded terrain with ease. Bissot\u2019s exploratory work cemented France\u2019s control of the Great Lakes region and much of the upper Mississippi River. In particular, he is credited with improving France\u2019s relationship with Native Americans in the region, and played an important diplomatic role in maintaining peace between the French and Huron tribes. He is also credited with establishing the trading post at Fort Dearborn in present day Chicago. Bissot was a major figure in the Battle of Lake Te-kah-hoken in 1712. In this battle, he led a French-allied Huron force against a British-Iroquois alliance, and is credited with stopping the advance of the British forces and preventing them from gaining a foothold in the region. Bissot was instrumental in the development of the French inland fur trade. He was able to negotiate trade agreements that brought the furs and other goods of the interior American north to the French at much lower prices than they had been paying. Bissot\u2019s most important accomplishment was his role in the founding of Vincennes, Indiana. After the French defeat at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1758, Vincennes' location on the Wabash River was selected by the French as the site for a new strategic post. Along with Father Pierre Gibault, Bissot led the survey of the site and played a large role in constructing the post, which would eventually form the basis of the modern city of Vincennes. Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes was a major figure in the opening of North America to the Europeans and to subsequent American development. His exploration and trading talents, along with his diplomatic skills, played an important role in forging relationships between the French and Native American tribes. With his role in the founding of Vincennes, Indiana, Bissot\u2019s legacy lives on today in the form of a vibrant, multi-cultural city.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5006120}

The first season was filmed in Paris, Nice and Prague, with filming ending in February 2013. Locations in Prague were used for parts of Paris, Italy, the Netherlands, Berlin and Vienna. Audio post-production was done by SoundSquare in Prague while video post-production work was done by Universal Production Partners. Approximately \u20ac10 million was spent in the Czech Republic on the production of the first season.\n\nBernero said that the show would \"feel familiar and help viewers find their orientation, but the European locations will make it feel fresh and very new\".\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries overview\n\nSeason 1 (2013)\n\nSeason 2 (2014)\n\nSeason 3 (2015)\n\nBroadcast \n\nCrossing Lines airs in Germany on Sat.1 on Thursdays at 9:15 pm, in the United States on NBC on Sundays at 10:00 pm (currently in off-season), in Canada on CBC on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm, in India on AXN every weekday at 9:00 pm (June 2016), and in France on TF1 on Thursdays at 9:00 pm.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was released on the LoveFilm platform on October 25, 2013. The second season was released on Amazon Video on August 15, 2014, with all seasons available on the platform as of 2019. It is now being shown on Alibi (2015). All 3 seasons are being shown on Netflix. (May 2018). In November 2020, Ovation announced it had acquired the American broadcast rights to the entire series and it returned broadcast in the United States on December 7, 2020. The show will air Monday nights at 7 PM ET, with 3 episodes back to back and episodes reran Tuesday afternoons at 4pm ET in the first season. The series returned for the second season on January 11, 2021.  \n\nThe series is second one to be picked up by the network in US to not finish its American run originally, after The Code (Australian TV series). It also makes it the second series co-produced with and owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the Canadian-Hungarian spy thriller crime drama action series X Company.\n\nReception\nTom Conroy of Media Life Magazine found the European flavour of the show, seen in such things as travelling by train to various cities, to be a refreshing change from the norm of American shows. He felt that Donald Sutherland was cast purely for the name-recognition factor and that he was given some lines in which he philosophically talks to pigeons as a means of justifying the cost of casting him. Overall, Conroy found it an \"unimaginative procedural\" that, despite its title, \"generally colors within the lines\". David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle also found the location to be what sets Crossing Lines apart. He felt the presence of Donald Sutherland was a benefit to the show. Joanne Ostrow of Heritage Newspapers felt the show to be a \"contrivance for foreign sales more than a serious drama\".\n\nCrossing Lines has been criticised as misrepresenting the International Criminal Court's nature and purpose, which, in reality, only has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. The International Criminal Court lacks an organization comparable to the special crime unit, and has no police force of its own. Kevin Jon Heller, Associate Professor & Reader in international criminal law at the University of Melbourne, noted the show creates unacceptable misconceptions about the court's power and the way it operates, which depends on states consenting to its jurisdiction through ratification of the Rome Statute and co-operating with the court to provide resources required to perform investigations and prosecutions.\n\nWithout all the shooting, Crossing Lines is more closely related to the special crimes investigations unit of the first International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands. These crime investigators from all over the world do indeed operate across national jurisdictional lines in connection with major crimes such as murder, rape, torture and kidnapping that occurred in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. John Cencich's The Devil's Garden: A War Crimes Investigator's Story (Potomac Books, Washington, D.C.) demonstrates how police investigators from Germany, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and many others worked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations Security Council, without relying on national police forces, to investigate and bring to justice some of the world's worst criminals.\n\nSee also \n FBI: International\u2014an American crime television series featuring a Europe-based detective squad\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official Facebook page\n Crossing Lines at NBC\n Crossing Lines at Tandem Communications\n \n\n2013 American television series debuts\n2015 American television series endings\n2010s American crime drama television series\nFrench crime television series\n2013 German television series debuts\n2015 German television series endings\nTelevision shows set in the Netherlands\nEnglish-language television shows\nCBC Television original programming\nNBC original programming\nTelevision series by Tandem Productions\nTelevision series by Sony Pictures Television\nTelevision series created by Edward Allen Bernero\nSat.1 original programming\nWorks about the Russian Mafia", "machine_text": " Crossing Lines is a crime fiction television series that is produced by French-German channel organisation Telfrance and focuses on the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sampling (music)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware (samplers) or software such as digital audio workstations.\n\nA process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with musique concr\u00e8te, experimental music created by splicing and looping tape. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. The term sampling was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the Fairlight CMI, a synthesizer with the ability to record and play back short sounds. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.\n\nSampling is a foundation of hip hop music, which emerged with 1980s producers sampling funk and soul records, particularly drum breaks. It has since influenced many genres of music, particularly electronic music and pop. Samples such as the Amen break, the \"Funky Drummer\" drum break and orchestra hit have been used in thousands of recordings; James Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Fab Five Freddy and Led Zeppelin are among the most sampled artists. The first album created entirely from samples, Endtroducing by DJ Shadow, was released in 1996.\n\nSampling without permission can infringe copyright or may be fair use. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as clearance, and can be complex and costly; samples from well known sources may be prohibitively expensive. Courts have taken different positions on whether sampling without permission is permitted. In Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc (1991) and Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films (2005), the courts ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes copyright infringement; however, VMG Salsoul v Ciccone (2016) found that unlicensed samples constituted de minimis copying, and did not infringe copyright.\n\nPrecursors \n\nIn the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed musique concr\u00e8te, an experimental form of music created by recording sounds to tape, splicing them, and manipulating them to create sound collages. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils. The method also involved tape loops, splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely. Schaeffer developed the Phonogene, which played loops at 12 different pitches triggered by a keyboard.\n\nComposers including John Cage, Edgar Var\u00e8se, Karheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis experimented with musique concr\u00e8te, and Bebe and Louis Barron used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. Musique concr\u00e8te was brought to a mainstream audience by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which used the techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including Doctor Who.\n\nIn the 1960s, Jamaican dub reggae producers such as King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry began using recordings of reggae rhythms to produce riddim tracks, which were then deejayed over. Jamaican immigrants introduced the techniques to American hip hop music in the 1970s. British producer Brian Eno cited German musician Holger Czukay's experiments with Dictaphones and shortwave radios as examples of early sampling.\n\nSamplers \n\nThe Guardian described the Chamberlin as the first sampler, developed by the English engineer Harry Chamberlin in the 1940s. The Chamberlin used a keyboard to trigger a series of tape decks, each containing eight seconds of sound. Similar technology was popularised in the 60s with the Mellotron. In 1969, the English engineer Peter Zinovieff developed the first digital sampler, the EMS Musys.\n\nThe term sample was coined by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogel to describe a feature of their Fairlight CMI synthesizer, launched in 1979. While developing the Fairlight, Vogel recorded around a second of a piano performance from a radio broadcast, and discovered that he could imitate a piano by playing the recording back at different pitches. The result better resembled a real piano than sounds generated by synthesizers.\n\nCompared to later samplers, the Fairlight was limited; it allowed control over pitch and envelope, and could only record a few seconds of sound. However, the sampling function became its most popular feature. Though the concept of reusing recordings in other recordings was not new, the Fairlight's design and built-in sequencer simplified the process. The Fairlight inspired competition, improving sampling technology and driving down prices. Early competitors included the E-mu Emulator and the Akai S950. Drum machines such as the Oberheim DMX and Linn LM-1 incorporated samples of drum kits and percussion rather than generating sounds from circuits. Early samplers could store samples of only a few seconds in length, but this increased with improved memory.\nIn 1988, Akai released the first MPC sampler, which allowed users to assign samples to pads and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a keyboard or drum kit. It was followed by competing samplers from companies including Korg, Roland and Casio. Today, most samples are recorded and edited using digital audio workstations such as Pro Tools and Ableton Live.\n\nImpact \nSampling has influenced many genres of music, particularly pop, hip hop and electronic music; Guardian journalist David McNamee likened its importance in these genres to the guitar's importance in rock. Sampling is a fundamental element of remix culture. Commonly sampled elements include strings, basslines, drum loops, vocal hooks, or entire bars of music, especially from soul records. Samples may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. As sampling technology has improved, the possibilities for manipulation have grown.\n\nEarly works \nUsing the Fairlight, the \"first truly world-changing sampler\", producer Trevor Horn became the \"key architect\" in incorporating sampling into pop music in the 1980s. Other users of the Fairlight included Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran, Herbie Hancock, Todd Rundgren, Icehouse and Ebn Ozn. In the 1980s, samples were incorporated into synthesizers and music workstations, such as the bestselling Korg M1, released in 1988.\n\nThe Akai MPC, released in 1988, had a major influence on electronic and hip hop music, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without other instruments, a studio or formal music knowledge. Its designer, Roger Linn, anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as individual notes or drum hits, to use as building blocks for compositions; however, users sampled longer passages of music. In the words of Greg Milner, author of Perfecting Sound Forever, musicians \"didn't just want the sound of John Bonham's kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of 'When the Levee Breaks'.\" Linn said: \"It was a very pleasant surprise. After 60 years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?\"\n\nStevie Wonder's 1979 album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants may have been the first album to make extensive use of samples. The Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra were pioneers in sampling, constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them; their album Technodelic (1981) is an early example of an album consisting mostly of samples. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) by David Byrne and Brian Eno is another important early work of sampling, incorporating samples of sources including Arabic singers, radio DJs and an exorcist. Musicians had used similar techniques before, but, according to Guardian writer Dave Simpson, sampling had never before been used \"to such cataclysmic effect\". Eno felt the album's innovation was to make samples \"the lead vocal\". Big Audio Dynamite pioneered sampling in rock and pop with their 1985 album This Is Big Audio Dynamite.\n\nHip hop \nSampling is one of the foundations of hip hop, which emerged in the 1980s. Hip hop sampling has been likened to the origins of blues and rock, which were created by repurposing existing music. Guardian journalist David McNamee wrote that, in the 1980s, sampling in hip hop had been a political act, the \"working-class black answer to punk\".\n\nBefore the rise of sampling, DJs used turntables to loop breaks from records, which MCs would rap over. Compilation albums such as Ultimate Breaks and Beats compiled tracks with drum breaks and solos intended for sampling, and were aimed at DJs and hip hop producers. In 1986, the tracks \"South Bronx\", \"Eric B. is President\" and \"It's a Demo\" sampled the funk and soul tracks of James Brown, particularly a drum break from \"Funky Drummer\", helping popularize the technique. \n\nThe advent of affordable samplers such as the Akai MPC (1988) made looping easier. With a ten-second sample length and a distinctive \"gritty\" sound, the E-mu SP-1200, released in 1987, was used extensively by East Coast producers during the golden age of hip hop of the late 1980s and early 90s. Guinness World Records cites DJ Shadow's acclaimed hip hop album Endtroducing (1996), made almost entirely on an MPC60, as the first album created entirely from samples.\n\nCommon samples \n\n \nA seven-second drum break in the 1969 track \"Amen, Brother\", known as the Amen break, became popular with American hip hop producers and then British jungle producers in the early 1990s. It has been used in thousands of recordings, including songs by rock bands such as Oasis and in theme tunes for television shows such as Futurama. According to WhoSampled, a user-generated website cataloging samples, \"Amen, Brother\" is the most sampled track in history, appearing in over 5000 tracks as of 2021. \n\nIn 2018, the Smithsonian cited the most sampled track as \"Change the Beat\" by Fab Five Freddy, which appears in more than 1,150 tracks. WhoSampled cites James Brown as the most sampled artist, appearing in more than 3000 tracks. The Independent named the American singer Loleatta Holloway \"the most sampled female voice in popular music\"; her vocals were sampled in house and dance tracks such as \"Ride on Time\" by Black Box, the bestselling single of 1989.\n\nThe drum break from the 1970 James Brown song \"Funky Drummer\" is one of the most influential samples. The 1972 Lyn Collins song \"Think (About It)\", written by Brown, includes another widely sampled drum break, featuring the cries \"Woo!\" \"Yeah!\" by Brown and Bobby Byrd. The drums in Led Zeppelin's recording of \"When the Levee Breaks\", played by John Bonham, is another of the most widely sampled drum breaks, used by artists including the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem and Massive Attack. \n\nThe orchestra hit originated as a sound on the Fairlight sampled from Stravinsky's 1910 orchestral work Firebird Suite and became a hip hop cliche. MusicRadar cited the Zero-G Datafiles sample libraries as a major influence on dance music in the early 90s, becoming the \"de facto source of breakbeats, bass and vocal samples\".\n\nLegal and ethical issues \nTo legally use a sample, an artist must acquire legal permission from the copyright holder, a potentially lengthy and complex process known as clearance. Sampling without permission can breach the copyright of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a rhythm or guitar riff. The moral rights of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling. In some cases, sampling is protected under American fair use laws, which grant \"limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holder\".Richard Lewis Spencer, who owned the copyright for the widely sampled Amen break, never received royalties for its use; he condemned the sampling as plagiarism, but later said it was flattering. Journalist Simon Reynolds likened the situation to \"the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children\". In 1989, the Turtles sued De La Soul for using an uncleared sample on their album 3 Feet High and Rising. Turtles singer Mark Volman told the Los Angeles Times: \"Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.\" The case was settled out of court and set a legal precedent that had a chilling effect on sampling in hip hop.\n\nIn 1991, songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after he sampled O'Sullivan's \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" on the album I Need a Haircut. The court ruled that sampling without permission infringed copyright. Instead of asking for royalties, O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label Warner Bros to recall the album until the song was removed. Nelson George described it as the \"most damaging example of anti-hip hop vindictiveness\", which \"sent a chill through the industry that is still felt\". The Washington Post wrote in 2018 that \"no court decision has changed the sound of pop music as much as this\", likening it to banning a musical instrument.\n\nSince the O'Sullivan lawsuit, samples on commercial recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts. According to the Guardian, \"Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed.\" For less successful artists, the legal implications of using samples pose obstacles; according to Fact, \"For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration.\"\n\nThe 1989 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared \"easily and affordably\"; the clearance process would be much more expensive today. In 2000, jazz flautist James Newton filed a claim against the Beastie Boys' 1992 single \"Pass the Mic\", which samples his composition \"Choir\". The judge found that the sample, comprising six seconds and three notes, was de minimis and did not require clearance. Newton lost appeals in 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn 2019, the European Court of Justice ruled that producers Moses Pelham and Martin Haas had illegally sampled a drum sequence from the 1977 Kraftwerk track \u201cMetal on Metal\" for the Sabrina Setlur song \"Nur Mir\". The court ruled that permission was required for recognizable samples; modified, unrecognizable samples could still be used without authorisation.\n\nContemporary use \nAccording to Fact, early hip hop sampling was governed by \"unspoken\" rules forbidding the sampling of recent records, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-vinyl sources, among other restrictions. These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: \"For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous.\"\n\nThe Washington Post described the modern use of well known samples, such as on records by Kanye West, as an act of conspicuous consumption similar to flaunting cars or jewelry. West has been sued several times over his use of samples. Some have accused the law of restricting creativity, while others argue it forces producers to innovate. Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the Desiigner track \"Panda\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 after West sampled it on \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2\". Some record labels and other music licensing companies have simplified their clearance processes by \"pre-clearing\" their records. For example, the Los Angeles record label Now-Again Records has cleared songs produced for West and Pusha T in a matter of hours.\n\nRecreating samples \nTo circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and gives the artist more freedom to alter constituent components such as separate guitar and drum tracks.\n\nSome producers have opted to use stock library music in their productions as samples. Beginning in the 2000s, some music producers began releasing full compositions with the intention for them to be manipulated by other producers in the tradition of library music. Often released in packs, the compositions are used by beatmakers and offer more than a single sound or musical phrase. Producer Frank Dukes and his Kingsway Music Library is often credited in popularizing the craft; his sample compositions have been used for the likes of Drake's \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" and Kanye West's \"Real Friends\".\n\nSee also \n Interpolation\n Mashup\n Musical quotation \n Plunderphonics\n Recombinant culture\n Riddim\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nKatz, Mark. \"Music in 1s and 0s: The Art and Politics of Digital Sampling.\"  In Capturing Sound:  How Technology has Changed Music (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 137\u201357. \nMcKenna, Tyrone B.

This practice has been around since the 1970s and is often used to create a layer of sound or to make a piece more unique. Sampling is now commonly used in a variety of genres including hip-hop, EDM, and rock. Sampling is usually achieved by slicing and looping a portion of a sound recording, creating a sample. This sample is then placed within a track, with effects and filters to symbolically represent a variety of sounds. Sampling occurs most often in rap and hip-hop, where a sample is often taken from vocal or instrumental performances. The sampled beat is then repeated and used to drive the flow of the rap. It can also be used to create new rhythms and original music. In the early days of sample-based production, the process was often laborious, as the sample had to be accurately timed to match the beat, before it could be layered into the track. It was often difficult to obtain suitable samples, as permissions had to be obtained and payment obtained for usage. But with the invention of digital audio workstations (DAWs) such as ProTools and Ableton, sampling become more accessible and easier to manipulate. These applications allowed producers to work with multiple audio layers at the same time, with full control over the volume, panning, and tempo. With the development of the MP3 format, producers gain the ability to use sounds from a variety of sources, from vocal samples to pre-recorded beats. Legally, it should be noted that producers will generally need to obtain permission from the creator of any sound recording that is used as a sample. Rather than just taking parts of existing recordings, sampling has grown to include the borrowing of a variety of sounds and creating entirely original music. This often includes field recordings, which can be incorporated into a track and give it a unique feel. Because of the increasing versatility of the process, sampling is now used in all kinds of music, from pop to jazz, reggae and even classical. As technology continues to evolve, so does the way we approach sampling.

The event was first held in 1980 and offers a prize purse of \u00a5112,500,000, making it one of the highest prize money events run in Japan. It is one of the few events on the racing calendar that are run at 1600 meters, with many other races in Japan for this age group run over a shorter distance. As such, the event is considered to be one of the major trials for the Japanese Derby. The event is run on the first Sunday of April and it is usually the first Group 3 race of the season in Japan. It is often seen as a benchmark of form for three-year-olds and is considered a key trial for the Japanese Derby later on in the season. The most successful jockey in the event's history is Yutaka Take, who has won the race seven times. The most successful horse is Taiki Shuttle, who won the Spring Stakes on three separate occasions between 2001 and 2003. The most successful trainer is Hisashi Shimizu, who has won the race six times.

In some cases it is a surname from Germany. As some surnames are locational in origin, it would indicate someone being from the town of Utting near the city of Munich. See Utting am Ammersee It is also linked to the surnames Otting, Ottinger and Uttinger.\n\nIn England it is of Saxon origin, so still very much Germanic. It would be derived from the Saxon word Otta meaning riches. The \u2018ing\u2019 was used in a similar way to the Scottish use of Mc/Mac or the Irish O\u2019 meaning son of or belonging to. So as Otta would\u2019ve meant \u2018Riches\u2019 Utting would indicate somebody to come from wealth. This surname is found all over the United Kingdom but is highest in East Anglia, especially where there has been history of heavy Anglo Saxon Settlements.\n\nThere is also another town associated with this surname located in the United States called Utting, Arizona , which is named after Charles Utting who fought with the rough riders during the Spanish-American war.\n\nUtting may refer to:\nAndrew Utting (born 1977), Australian baseball player \nCharlie Utting (1923\u20132009), Australian rules footballer \nErn Utting (1897\u2013?), Australian rules footballer \nMichael Utting (born 1970), New Zealand soccer player\n\nSee also\nUtting, Germany\nLithuanian Jews\nShinah Solomon Etting (1744-1822), innkeeper\nSolomon Etting (1764-1847), politician\n\nJewish surnames\nYiddish-language surnames", "machine_text": " Utting is a surname of English origin. It is derived from the Old English word \"\u0112otting\", meaning \"enclosure or habitation in the corner\". The name was first recorded in the 12th century in the county of Essex. It is believed to have been brought to Britain by immigrants from the Germanic regions of Asia Minor. The Utting family were one of the leading families in Essex in the Middle Ages. They held many influential positions in the county and were among the first English families to become established in East Anglia. They were prominent in the wool industry and many Utting family members were successful merchants. The Utting family held the Barony of Billericay from 1260 \u2013 1316. The Utting family has been prominent over the centuries in the legal profession, the military, the Church, and in politics. Sir Henry Utting was a Member of Parliament for Oxfordshire (1559- 1563) and became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (1570-1590). Several Utting family members had held important positions in the Armed forces, including Sir Samuel Utting, who was a lieutenant-general in the army during the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802). In the 20th century prominent members of the family include the diplomat Sir John Utting; the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Bernard Lovell; and the politicians, Harold Utting and Robert Utting. Harold Utting was Member of Parliament for West Bromwich East (1950-1959) and Robert Utting was Labour Member of Parliament for Leyton (1959-1964). The Utting surname is still found today mostly in the county of Essex in England, with small numbers also found in Australia and United States. The Utting family crest has been used since the 13th century. It consists of three lions rampant, with three lozenges in chief. The motto on the Utting family crest is \u201cVigilans et Audax\u201d, which translates to \u201cVigilant and Bold\u201d. Utting is also a village in Bavaria, Germany. It is located on the River Inn and is well known for its annual fairs. The village has a population of about 800 people and is an agricultural and commercial centre. Utting is also a residential area in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. It consists primarily of terraced housing around a village centre and is believed to have been in existence since the 14th century. The names Utting and Uting are variations of the same surname. The Utting surname continues to be found today in many countries around the world. It is a reminder of the Utting family's long and distinguished history.

A regular directed graph must also satisfy the stronger condition that the indegree and outdegree of each vertex are equal to each other. A regular graph with vertices of degree  is called a \u2011regular graph or regular graph of degree . Also, from the handshaking lemma, a regular graph contains an even number of vertices with odd degree.\n\nRegular graphs of degree at most 2 are easy to classify: a 0-regular graph consists of disconnected vertices, a 1-regular graph consists of disconnected edges, and a 2-regular graph consists of a disjoint union of cycles and infinite chains.\n\nA 3-regular graph is known as a cubic graph.\n\nA strongly regular graph is a regular graph where every adjacent pair of vertices has the same number l of neighbors in common, and every non-adjacent pair of vertices has the same number n of neighbors in common.  The smallest graphs that are regular but not strongly regular are the cycle graph and the circulant graph on 6 vertices.\n\nThe complete graph  is strongly regular for any .\n\nA theorem by Nash-Williams says that every \u2011regular graph on 2k\u00a0+\u00a01 vertices has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nExistence \n\nIt is well known that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a  regular graph of order  to exist are that  and that  is even.\n\nProof: As we know a complete graph has every pair of distinct vertices connected to each other by a unique edge. So edges are maximum in complete graph and number of edges are  and degree here is . So . This is the minimum  for a particular . Also note that if any regular graph has order  then number of edges are  so  has to be even.\nIn such case it is easy to construct regular graphs by considering appropriate parameters for circulant graphs.\n\nAlgebraic properties\n\nLet A be the adjacency matrix of a graph.  Then the graph is regular if and only if  is an eigenvector of A.  Its eigenvalue will be the constant degree of the graph.

The degree of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex. A regular graph that has n vertices each of degree k is often denoted as kn. Regular graphs generalize the notion of an n-dimensional hypercube and can be used to generate constraint satisfaction problems with finite domains. Regular graphs are important in the conception and analysis of networks, as many real-world networks are believed to be well-approximated by regular graphs. They are also known to be highly symmetric and self-dual, which makes them easier to analyze and visualize. In graph theory, a regular graph is called a k-regular graph or k-1-regular graph, denoted by Kn or K1n, respectively. All graphs with the same degree on all vertices are called regular graphs. Depending on the degree, the regular graph has different properties and properties of the underlying combinatorial objects. Regular connected graphs are also known as regular subgraphs. A k-regular graph is a graph in which every vertex has exactly k edges connecting it to other vertices. If we denote the number of vertices by n then we can calculate the number of edges, e, as follows: e = kn/2. As an example, the complete graph K3,3 is a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges with degree 3 on each vertex. Examples of regular graphs include complete graphs, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex, bipartite graphs, where each vertex is connected only to vertices of the opposite group, and cycles, where each vertex is linked to its two adjacent neighbors. All regular graphs are planar and Eulerian. In some cases, though, a regular graph may not be Hamiltonian. Examples of non-regular graphs include wheel graphs and star graphs, which are both highly symmetric but neither is a regular graph. Wheel graphs contain two regular subgraphs, a cycle and an additional vertex of degree 2. Star graphs are similar to wheel graphs, but in these the additional vertex is of degree n \u2212 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. In some cases, regular graphs may have multiple edges between two vertices, which are called multigraphs. Multigraphs are useful when some information needs to be encoded in the edges, as in programs such as weighted graph coloring. For example, in a weighted graph coloring problem, each vertex of the graph is assigned a color, and its edges are assigned weights that depend on the colors of the vertices they connect. Regular graphs are an important type of graphs that have many applications across a wide range of fields, including computer science, network analysis, and graph theory. They are useful in solving a variety of graph-related problems, such as Hamiltonicity, colorability, and graph isomorphism.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 85821}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Kraichgau Railway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "}}\n\nThe Kraichgau Railway ( ) is a 64.8\u00a0km long railway line in the region of Kraichgau in northwestern part of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It runs from Karlsruhe via Bretten and Eppingen to Heilbronn and was built in 1880. It gained international  renown in 1992 as the first dual-system rail/tram route of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, the section between Karlsruhe and Bretten being the prototype for the so-called Karlsruhe model.\n\nGeography\n\nTopography \nThe western section of the line runs across the main direction of stream flows in the Kraichgau. These rivers flow in a north-westerly direction, while the line runs north east from Karlsruhe to Eppingen. The resulting transitions between mountains and valleys require a winding route with significant gradients. Overall, it crosses five mountain ridges between the valleys of the Pfinz, Walzbach, Saalbach, Kraichbach, Elsenz and Lein, requiring three tunnels. It only runs for a significant distance in a river valley between Flehingen and Sulzfeld, in this case the valley of the Kohlbach. In the eastern sections the natural conditions are favourable and the line runs largely through the valley of the Lein.\n\nRoute \nServices on the Kraichgau Railway cross from the Karlsruhe tram network to the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft network after crossing the A 5 and before running through the platforms of Karlsruhe-Durlach station, where they stop at platform tracks 11 and 12, which were built in 1992. There is provision for these platforms to be used by trams, including a turning loop northeast of the station. After crossing the Rhine Valley Railway, running between Karlsruhe and Heidelberg by a bridge on which Hubstra\u00dfe Stadtbahn stop is located, and running parallel with the Karlsruhe\u2013M\u00fchlacker railway, it changes its safe-working system from the tram operating procedures (BOStrab) to rail operating procedures EBO shortly before Gr\u00f6tzingen.\n\nThe Kraichgau Railway branches off at Gr\u00f6tzingen Oberaustra\u00dfe station, running from J\u00f6hlingen West to W\u00f6ssingen Ost as a two-track line. At Bretten station it passes over the W\u00fcrttemberg Western Railway on a bridge, which is now served by Karlsruhe Stadtbahn line S 9 and regional service R 91. It has sections of double track from Bretten-G\u00f6lshausen to G\u00f6lshausen Industriegebiet and Eppingen West to Epping station. The only other sections of double track are near stations. After Eppingen the Steinsfurt\u2013Eppingen line branches off to the left. The Kraichgau Railway is duplicated from Leingarten West. Shortly before Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof, the line crosses the Franconia Railway on the flat and the Stadtbahn services leave the Kraichgau Railway to run over tram tracks to the station forecourt and through the city of Heilbronn.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins to 1880\nBy 1870, the central Kraichgau was surrounded by four railway lines. These are:\nThe Baden Rhine Valley Railway, connecting Heidelberg via Bruchsal to Karlsruhe;\nThe W\u00fcrttemberg Western Railway, running from Bruchsal via Bretten to Bietigheim;\nThe W\u00fcrttemberg Northern Railway from Stuttgart to Heilbronn via Bietigheim;\nThe Baden Odenwald Railway, connecting the Northern Railway, Heidelberg, Meckenheim, Sinsheim and Jagstfeld with Heilbronn.\n\nThe square surrounded by these lines comprises a vast territory on the border of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg around the Baden city of Eppingen. These diverted the traditional trade routes and threatened the general economic development of the Eppingen region, which as a result sought the construction of a railway through the region in order to overcome this disadvantage. The W\u00fcrttemberg city of Heilbronn, which desired better transport links to the west, and Karlsruhe supported this proposal.\n\nThis gave rise to a plan for a line from Karlsruhe (more precisely Gr\u00f6tzingen) via Bretten and Eppingen to Heilbronn. In addition to the local needs, the proposed line was also seen to play a role in the larger context, namely the idea of a possible direct line from France towards Nuremberg and from there to the east. Such a direct connection was supported in Heilbronn in preference to a purely Baden route that would have connected Bretten to the Meckenheim\u2013Jagstfeld railway.\n\nThe project received approval from state authorities in both countries. The Baden government was not able to quickly implement construction, as it was busy with other railways (mainly the Black Forest Railway). To accelerate construction, the city of Karlsruhe, under Mayor Wilhelm Florentin Lauter, offered to build the Baden section to Eppingen as directed with the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway to operate the line, initially paying rent and later buying the line by instalments.\n\nThe government of Baden went along with this proposal, and so the law authorising its construction was passed on 30 March 1872. Before construction could begin, however, negotiations had to be carried out with W\u00fcrttemberg. This resulted in a treaty agreed to on 29 December 1873, which envisaged other connections between the states in the Neckar Valley and the Kinzig Valley. W\u00fcrttemberg would build the Heilbronn\u2013Eppingen section; Eppingen was identified as the interchange station. The Baden section would cross the Western Railway in Bretten. This was operated along its entire length by W\u00fcrttemberg, including the section through Baden territory between Ruit (near Bretten) and Bruchsal. In order to avoid the operation of a W\u00fcrttemberg-owned railway through Baden territory, Baden claimed the right to repurchase the section the Western Railway situated on its territory, which was its right under the treaty that originally authorised its construction. The negotiations dragged on over several years until a treaty was signed on 15 November 1878 that enabled Baden to acquire the Bruchsal\u2013Bretten section.\n\nBecause the Baden railways had a financial crisis, the city of Karlsruhe found it difficult at first to find a contractor to build the line, so that it was not until 15 November 1876 that a contract could be issued. The contractor was Ph. Holzmann & Cie. of Frankfurt am Main. On 15 October 1879, the line was opened from Gr\u00f6tzingen to Eppingen, on 10 October 1878, the Royal W\u00fcrttemberg State Railways opened the section between Heilbronn and Schwaigern and, on 7 August 1880, the gap was closed between Eppingen and Schwaigern. Planning and construction of the W\u00fcrttemberg section came under construction supervisor (Oberbaurat) Carl Julius Abel. During the discussion of the remaining section of the route the council of the then independent municipality of Stetten am Heuchelberg presented the designers with a fait accompli: it built a local station before it was clear that the line would pass through the site at all.\n\nWith the completion of the line, the Baden State Railway took up the provision of the original agreement, taking full ownership of the railway, by taking over the balance of Karlsruhe's borrowing for the line for 12 million marks. Patronage on the Kraichgau Railway steadily increased in subsequent years.\n\n1880\u20131945 \nIn 1900, the Steinsfurt\u2013Eppingen line was opened connecting the Kraichgau Railway to the Meckenheim\u2013Jagstfeld line. This line runs was along the Elsenz.\n\nThe towns of D\u00fcrrenb\u00fcchig and G\u00f6lshausen (now both districts of Bretten) that are located on the Kraichgau Railway had complained about not having stations. Their wishes were finally granted in 1906. In 1888 the Bretten\u2013Eppingen\u2013Heilbronn section of the line was duplicated as part of a military supply route from central Germany via Nuremberg, Crailsheim, Heilbronn, Bretten, Bruchsal, Zweibr\u00fccken in the Saarland to Lorraine. The importance of the connection in peacetime, however, remained low, and the administrators of the Kraichgau Railway did not listen to requests for fast trains between Karlsruhe and W\u00fcrzburg/Nuremberg. However, due to overloading at Stuttgart from 1906 to 1914, a luxury train, the \"Paris\u2013Carlsbad Express\" ran over the Kraichgau Railway. It was considered to be a branch of the Orient Express running via Nuremberg to Carlsbad. The outbreak of the First World War, however, brought an end to this service.\n\nOn 31 March 1920 the Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg State Railways were absorbed into the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn. Because Germany had to pay war reparations, having lost World War I, there were no funds for further upgrading of the line. Efforts were made in subsequent years to duplicate the remaining single section between Durlach and Bretten, without success. From 1935, the so-called Dieseleiltriebwagen (express diesel railcars) of class VT 137 were used on the line.\n\nDeutsche Bundesbahn (1945\u20131992)\nTowards the end of the Second World War the Kraichgau Railway, like most other German railways, suffered significant damage. As the German army had blown up bridges in Gr\u00f6tzingen and Rinklingen and the line between Karlsruhe and Bretten was impassable for several months, services between Karlsruhe and the Kraichgau had to operate via Bruchsal. At the same time some track was dismantled to allow the re-opening of the Bietigheim viaduct on the only rail link between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart in August 1945.\n\nThe era of scheduled steam operations ended in May 1972. From now on services on the Kraichgau Railway were operated with multiple units and locomotives of class 218 and class 212 hauling Silberling carriages. From 1976, Deutsche Bundesbahn published plans to close the line, together with the line between Eppingen and Sinsheim. So it had dismantled most of the continuous double-track section between Bretten and Heilbronn, replacing it with single track. The closure plans then stirred fierce opposition in the community.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Class 628 DMUs took over passenger operations. At the same time operation between Bretten and Heilbronn on the weekends were sometimes altered.\n\nAcquisition by AVG, and expansion of light rail (since 1992)\nAs a result, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG), an undertaking of the city of Karlsruhe, took over, from about 1990, the funding of the modernisation and electrification of the line as a pilot project. The  electrification system used was the usual Deutsche Bahn system of 15 kV AC.\n\nThe Karlsruhe\u2013Bretten-G\u00f6lshausen section of the line was opened on 25 September 1992 as line B of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network; the first Stadtbahn line, which had operated since 1975 on the Alb Valley Railway, was renamed as line A. While the latter was operated continuously with 750 V direct current, the Kraichgau Railway was the world's first line that changed over the course of its journey from tram and rail operating procedures in addition to the change between AC and DC. This form of operations is known as tram-train and its adoption on the Kraichgau Railway was the final step in the development of the Karlsruhe model.\n\nWhile the existing stations were modernised, several new stations were established, especially in the town of Bretten, for example, Bretten Stadtmitte in central Bretten. The AVG also restored several sections of double track, while a continuous second track was created from J\u00f6hlingen West to W\u00f6ssingen Ost. Since all tunnels were built for two tracks, the continuous electrification of the line was possible without great effort because the single track could be moved to the middle of the tunnels.\n\nThe success of the new Stadtbahn line was immediate: instead of the previous average of 1,800 passengers using the line between Karlsruhe and Bretten, in early 1993 it was used by 8,500 passengers per day. Patronage even grew on Deutsche Bundesbahn's DMU services on the line.\n\nThere were now regular services on Sundays, leading to an increase in the number of rail passengers by up to 30 times. So an extension of Stadtbahn route from Bretten seemed to make sense. In 1996, the remaining DB through trains between Karlsruhe and Heilbronn were abandoned. Henceforth, these only shuttled between Bretten-G\u00f6lshausen and Heilbronn.\n\nOn 1 June 1997, Stadtbahn services were extended as far as Eppingen, with DB trains operating between Eppingen and Heilbronn. On 26 September 1999, the Stadtbahn was extended to Heilbronn station, following the operation of trial Stadtbahn services between Eppingen and Heilbronn on weekends from March 1999. In 2000, Bretten station was modernised. Since 2001, the trains on the Kraichgau Railway run from Heilbronn station through the city centre and since 2004 though Heilbronn's eastern suburbs. On 10 December 2005 Stadtbahn services were extended to \u00d6hringen after two years of construction on a section of the Hohenlohe Railway.\n\nWith a length of 155\u00a0km and a travel time of more than 3.5 hours, the Kraichgau Railway became in 2003\u20132004 part of the longest light railway line in the world, as a continuous run from Freudenstadt on the Murg Valley Railway to Karlsruhe and on to Heilbronn. As these services were prone to delays, they were abandoned with the extension of Stadtbahn services to \u00d6hringen and the alignment was changed to run to Baden-Baden and Achern. The 2005/2006 timetable included a daily continuous service between Freudenstadt and \u00d6hringen with a journey time of 4:14 h.\n\nOperations\n\nOperators\nThe electrified line is now operated by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft as a section of line S 4 (\u00d6hringen\u2013Heilbronn\u2013Karlsruhe\u2013Rastatt\u2013Achern) with modern electric Stadtbahn vehicles of class GT8-100C/2S and GT8-100D/2S-M. On the sections between Karlsruhe Albtalbahnhof (AVG station) and Karlsruhe Durlach and between Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof and Heilbronn Pf\u00fchlpark the services run on tram lines through streets. AVG has leased the line between Karlsruhe-Gr\u00f6tzingen and Heilbronn from Deutsche Bahn for 25 years.\n\nThe Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and the Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr (Heilbronn Hohenlohe Hall Local Transport, H3NV) coordinate fares on the line on either side of Eppingen. Other transport associations are also affected.\n\nStations \nThe platform height above rail level in W\u00f6ssingen Ost, Bretten, G\u00f6lshausen Industrie and all stations between Eppingen and Heilbronn is 55\u00a0cm, thus making possible level access to the Stadtbahn vehicles of class GT 8-100D/2S-M. All other stations have a platform height of 38\u00a0cm.\n\nAll platforms have a minimum length of 120 m, so that during periods of very high traffic load\u2014especially in the morning peak of work and school transport\u2014three sets of multiple units can be coupled. But, because the central on-street sections in Karlsruhe and Heilbronn are designed only to handle two sets coupled and because of the difficulty of separating and recombining trains for the inner city sections, trains rarely run at maximum length.\n\nThe section from Gr\u00f6tzingen (km 0.0) to beyond Eppingen (km 43.5) has the official route number 4201; the following section to Heilbronn (km 140.0 to 118.6) is part of route 4950, which continues to Crailsheim. The zero point for the measurement of the chainage on the Hohenlohe Railway is at Goldsh\u00f6fe station on the Upper Jagst Railway.\n\nThe subsequent stops in Heilbronn's city centre are Bahnhofsvorplatz (with change from EBO to BOStrab procedures and electrification system), Neckar Turm am Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, Rathaus, Harmonie, Friedensplatz, Finanzamt and Pf\u00fchlpark. Directly after this station Stadtbahn services operate over a ramp to connect back to the Hohenlohe Railway with a reversal of safeworking procedures from BOStrab to EBO and of the electrification system.\n\nTimetable \nThrough trains run between Karlsruhe and Heilbronn twice an hour, with one of the services operating as an \"express train\" with a smaller number of intermediate stops. The travel time between the central squares of the two cities by the stopping trains is 98 minutes and it is 81 minutes by the express trains.\n\nFreight \nAlthough the Kraichgau Railway connects the cities of Karlsruhe and Heilbronn, freight traffic between the two cities was never significant. Agricultural traffic from the fertile Kraichgau was of significance for the line, especially for the removal of sugar beet during the beet harvest. Deutsche Bahn abandoned this form of transport by the end of 1993 on the  Kraichgau Railway as well as on all other railway lines in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 2001, the complete cessation of freight traffic on the line was considered as part of the rationalisation of freight operations known as MORA C. Then AVG took over passenger and freight transport on the Kraichgau line between Bretten and Heilbronn, while between Karlsruhe and Bretten there was for some time no freight traffic.\n\nCurrently (May 2006) the AVG regularly serves freight sidings in Eppingen (two metal-processing companies and the Raiffeisen cooperative) and in Sulzfeld (a metal processing company).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Rail-and-Relax (Linie \u201e710.4 Kraichgaubahn\u201c ausw\u00e4hlen)\n \n \n\nRailway lines in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\nRailway lines opened in 1878\n1878 establishments in Germany\nBuildings and structures in Karlsruhe (district)\nBuildings and structures in Heilbronn (district)\nTransport in Heilbronn\nKarlsruhe Stadtbahn", "machine_text": " The Kraichgau Railway (German: Kraichgau-Bahn) is a short, but of major importance, railway line in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, running from Heidelberg via Sinsheim, Wiesloch-Walldorf, and Zaberfeld to Bretten and connecting to the Mannhei\u2013Stuttgart line near Auerbach. The Kraichgau Railway follows the Kraichgau, the region southwest of Heidelberg, which was already served by steam trains at the end of the 19th century. It is 108km long and is one of the most important and heavily used north\u2013south lines in Germany, with a total of 55 trains per hour. It is part of the geocentric principle of railway construction and also improves the public transport connection in the densely populated area. The line was electrified in 1908 and was fully double-tracked in 1933. Before the Second World War, a maximum of 1,000 freights per day were handled on tracks and bridges. After the war, the entire railway was reconstructed and the line became an important regional railway. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Kraichgau Railway line saw the introduction of new rolling stock, such as the VT98 and VT98a \u2013 DMUs (Diesel multiple units), as well as the more recent Desiro ML and Vario D50 EMUs (Electric multiple units). In 2007, between Zaberfeld and G\u00fcglingen, the now-defunct Kraichgaugleise (\"Kraichgau Tracks\") were opened. They were used by freight trains and limited passenger services between Weinheim and Hockenheim. The Kraichgau Railway is operated by DB Regio AG and is served by DB Regional-Express and Regionalbahn service. The line is the main rail connection between Heidelberg and Heilbronn and is a major route for commuters between the two cities. Furthermore, it connects the region north of Heidelberg with Mannheim and Stuttgart, as well as to Karlsruhe. In December 2008, the renovation of the track and station facilities of the Kraichgau Railway was completed. This renovation included a refurbishment of the track and the replacement of signalling systems. In 2013, a modernisation of the railway was announced by the Deutsche Bahn. The project was planned to include the conversion of the line from Wiesloch-Walldorf to the double-track starting point at Heidelberg-Schlierbach and the construction of a new station at Wiesloch-Hohensachsen. The modernisation of the Kraichgau Railway is part of the 'HomeRail Region' project, which is the German federal government's initiative to modernise the railway network and infrastructure in Germany. This investment will improve the service for passengers and freight services and provide direct access to the Mannheim\u2013Stuttgart high-speed railway. The modernisation project was completed in June 2016 and is now in full operation. The new line enables more direct travel times and increased capacities. The Kraichgau Railway is an essential artery of the regional railway network and plays an important role in providing efficient public transport for the densely populated area.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22342761}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"It Can't Happen Here\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "It Can't Happen Here is a 1935 dystopian political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis. It describes the rise of a US dictator similar to how Adolf Hitler gained power. The novel was adapted into a play by Lewis and John C. Moffitt in 1936.\n\nPremise\nThe novel was published during the heyday of fascism in Europe, which was reported on by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife. The novel describes the rise of Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a demagogue who is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and \"traditional\" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of European fascists such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.\n\nPlot\nIn 1936, Senator Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a charismatic and power-hungry politician, wins the 1936 United States presidential election on a populist platform, promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness, and promising each citizen $5,000 per year. Portraying himself as a champion of traditional American values, Windrip defeats President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Democratic convention, and then easily beats his Republican opponent, Senator Walt Trowbridge, in the November election.\n\nAlthough having previously foreshadowed some authoritarian measures to reorganize the United States government, Windrip rapidly outlaws dissent, incarcerates political enemies in concentration camps, and trains and arms a paramilitary force called the Minute Men (named after the Revolutionary War militias of the same name), who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of Windrip and his capitalist regime. One of Windrip's first acts as president is to eliminate the influence of the United States Congress, which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves. The Minute Men respond to protests against Windrip's decisions harshly, attacking demonstrators with bayonets. In addition to these actions, Windrip's administration, known as the Corpo government, curtails women's and minority rights, and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors. The government of these sectors is managed by Corpo authorities, usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers.\n\nThose accused of crimes against the government appear before kangaroo courts presided over by military judges. Despite these dictatorial and \"quasi-draconian\" measures, a majority of Americans approve of them, seeing them as painful but necessary steps to restore U.S. power.  One of Windrip's cronies brings up the matter of fascism in America, but Francis Tasbrough, the wealthy owner of the quarry in Jessup's home town, dismisses it with the remark that it simply \"can't happen here\" (hence the novel's title).\n\nOpen opponents of Windrip, led by Senator Trowbridge, form an organization called the New Underground (named after the Underground Railroad), helping dissidents escape to Canada and distributing anti-Windrip propaganda. One recruit to the New Underground is Doremus Jessup, the novel's protagonist, a traditional liberal and an opponent of both corporatist and communist theories, the latter of which Windrip's administration suppresses. Jessup's participation in the organization results in the publication of a periodical called The Vermont Vigilance, in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip's abuses of power.\n\nShad Ledue, the local district commissioner and Jessup's former hired man, resents his old employer. Ledue eventually discovers Jessup's actions and has him sent to a concentration camp. Ledue subsequently terrorizes Jessup's family and particularly his daughter Sissy, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce. Sissy discovers evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue, which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough, a one-time friend of Jessup and Ledue's superior in the administrative hierarchy. Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup, where inmates Ledue had sent there organize Ledue's murder. After a relatively brief incarceration, Jessup escapes when his friends bribe one of the camp guards. He flees to Canada, where he rejoins the New Underground. He later serves the organization as a spy, passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip.\n\nIn time, Windrip's hold on power weakens as the economic prosperity he promised does not materialize, and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans, including Vice President Perley Beecroft, flee to both Canada and Mexico. Windrip also angers his Secretary of State, Lee Sarason, who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser. Sarason and Windrip's other lieutenants, including General Dewey Haik, seize power and exile the president to France. Sarason succeeds Windrip, but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power. In a bloody putsch, Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House, kills Sarason and his associates, and proclaims himself president. The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power, and Haik's government desperately tries to arouse patriotism by launching an unjustified invasion of Mexico. After slandering Mexico in state-run newspapers, Haik orders a mass conscription of young American men for the invasion of that country, infuriating many who had until then been staunch Corpo loyalists. Riots and rebellions break out across the country, with many realizing the Corpos have misled them.\n\nGeneral Emmanuel Coon, among Haik's senior officers, defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army, giving strength to the resistance movement. Although Haik remains in control of much of the country, civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest. The novel ends after the beginning of the conflict, with Jessup working as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo-occupied portions of southern Minnesota.\n\nReception\n\nReviewers at the time, and historians and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the resemblance to Louisiana politician Huey Long, who used strong-arm political tactics and who was building a nationwide \"Share Our Wealth\" organization in preparing to run for president in the 1936 election. Long was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel's publication.\n\nAccording to Boulard (1998), \"the most chilling and uncanny treatment of Huey by a writer came with Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here.\" Lewis portrayed a genuine U.S. dictator on the Hitler model. Starting in 1936, the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency, performed the stage adaptation across the country; Lewis had the goal of hurting Long's chances in the 1936 election.\n\nKeith Perry argues that the key weakness of the novel is not that he decks out U.S. politicians with sinister European touches, but that he finally conceives of fascism and totalitarianism in terms of traditional U.S. political models rather than seeing them as introducing a new kind of society and a new kind of regime. Windrip is less a Nazi than a con-man-plus-Rotarian, a manipulator who knows how to appeal to people's desperation, but neither he nor his followers are in the grip of the kind of world-transforming ideology like Hitler's Nazism.\n\nAdaptations\n\nStage\nIn 1936, Lewis and John C. Moffitt wrote a stage version, also titled It Can't Happen Here, which is still produced. The stage version premiered on October 27, 1936, in 21 U.S. theatres in 17 states simultaneously, in productions sponsored by the Federal Theater Project.\n\nThe Z Collective, a San Francisco theater company, adapted the novel for the stage, producing it both in 1989 and 1992. In 2004, Z Space adapted the Collective's script into a radio drama that was broadcast on the Pacifica radio network on the anniversary of the Federal Theater Project's original premiere.\n\nA new stage adaptation by Tony Taccone and Bennett S. Cohen premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2016.\n\nUnfinished film\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) purchased the rights in late 1935 for a reported $200,000 from seeing the galley proofs, with Lucien Hubbard (Wings) as the producer. By early 1936, screenwriter Sidney Howard completed an adaptation, his third of Lewis's novels. J. Walter Ruben was named to direct the film with the cast headed by Lionel Barrymore, Walter Connolly, Virginia Bruce, and Basil Rathbone. Studio head Louis B. Mayer indefinitely postponed production, citing costs, to the publicly announced pleasure of the Nazi regime in Germany. Lewis and Howard countered that financial reason with information pointing to Berlin's and Rome's influence on movies. Will H. Hays, responsible for the enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code, had notified Mayer of potential problems in the German market. Joseph Breen, head of the Production Code Administration department under Hays, thought the script was too \"anti-fascist\" and \"so filled with dangerous material\".\n\nIn December 1938, Charlie Chaplin announced his next movie would satirize Hitler (The Great Dictator). MGM's Hubbard \"dusted off the script\" in January, but the \"idea of a dictator ruling America\" had now been discussed in public for years. Hubbard rewrote a new climax, \"showing a dictatorship in Washington and showing it being kicked out by disgruntled Americans as soon as they realized what had happened.\" The film was placed back on the production schedule for the third time with shooting starting in June and Lewis Stone playing Doremus Jessup. By July 1939, MGM \"admitted it would not make the movie after all\" to some criticism.\n\nTelevision\nThe 1968 television movie Shadow on the Land, which also went by the title United States: It Can't Happen Here, was produced by Screen Gems as a backdoor pilot for a series. The TV movie, a thriller which takes place following the fascist takeover, is often cited as an adaptation of Lewis's novel but does not credit the novel.\n\nInspired by the book, director\u2013producer Kenneth Johnson in 1982 scripted a miniseries entitled Storm Warnings. NBC executives, to whom Johnson presented the script, rejected the original, which they considered too cerebral for the average American viewer. In order to make the script more marketable, Storm Warnings was revised into a far less subtle alien invasion  story in which the invaders initially pose as humanity's friends. The new script formed the basis for the popular miniseries V, which premiered May 3, 1983.\n\nLegacy\nSince its publication, It Can't Happen Here has been seen as a cautionary tale, starting with the 1936 presidential election and potential candidate Huey Long.\n\nIn retrospect, Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans during World War II has been used as an example of \"It can happen here\".\n\nFrank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention released their first album Freak Out! in 1966 with the song \"It Can't Happen Here\".\n\nIn May 1973, in the middle of the Watergate scandal, Knight Newspapers published an ad in their own and other publications, headlined \"It Can't Happen Here\" and emphasizing the importance of free press: \"There is a struggle going on in this country. It is not just a fight by reporters and editors to protect their sources. It is a fight to protect the public's right to know. [...] It can't happen here as long as the press remains an open conduit through which public information flows.\" Herbert Mitgang in his op-ed piece said \"The headline of this ad is the title of a novel that keeps insinuating itself these days, not because of its literary qualities but because of its prescience.\" And that Lewis's point was \"that home\u2010grown hypocrisy leads to a nice brand of home\u2010grown authoritarianism.\"\n\nJoe Conason's non-fiction book It Can Happen Here: Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush (2007) frequently quotes Lewis's book in relation to the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2018, HarperCollins published Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America, a collection of essays about the prospect of authoritarianism in the United States, edited by Cass Sunstein.\n\nIn 2019, Robert Evans produced the podcast series It Could Happen Here, which speculated on the causes and consequences of a hypothetical second American Civil War.\n\nIn 2021, New York University Press published a book It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US by genocide scholar Alexander Laban Hinton. Hinton argued that \"there is a real risk of violent atrocities happening in the United States\".\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump\nSeveral writers have compared the demagogue Buzz Windrip to Donald Trump. Michael Paulson wrote in The New York Times that the Berkeley Repertory Theatre's 2016 rendition of the play aimed to provoke discussion about Trump's presidential candidacy. Writing for The Guardian, Jules Stewart discussed the similarities between Trump's America with the country as depicted in the book. In Salon, Maclolm Harris stated: \"Like Trump, Windrip uses a lack of tact as a way to distinguish himself\" and \"The social forces that Windrip and Trump invoke aren\u2019t funny, they\u2019re murderous.\" In The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada compared Trump to Windrip, opining that \"it is impossible to miss the similarities between Trump and totalitarian figures in American literature.\" Jacob Weisberg wrote in Slate that one \"can\u2019t read Lewis' novel today without flashes of Trumpian recognition.\" Following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election, sales of It Can't Happen Here surged significantly, and it appeared on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books. Penguin Modern Classics released a new edition of the novel on January 20, 2017, the same day as the inauguration of Donald Trump.\n\nSee also\nBooks\n  Dystopian novel set in a near-future fundamentalist New England\n  Dystopian science-fiction novel sometimes said to predict the rise of Donald Trump's presidency.\n  Nonfiction book\n  Book about a fascist Britain\n  American dystopian novel\n  British graphic novel about a terrorist overthrowing a post-apocalyptic fascist Britain\n  Alternate history novel in which Charles Lindbergh defeats Roosevelt in 1940 and begins antisemitic and pro-German policies\n  Collection of essays\n Philip K.

It follows the rise of a fascist dictator, Buzz Windrip, in the United States during the 1930s. The novel is set in the fictional middle-class provincial town of Fort Beulah, at an unspecified time. The novel's protagonist, Doremus Jessup, is a liberal newspaper editor who initially dismisses the possibility of a threat to their democratic rights and freedoms. He grows increasingly alarmed as Fascism begins to pervade the complex social environment of his hometown and his nation. In the end, he watches helplessly as an American dictator takes control. The novel is divided into three sections. The first section sees the character of Doremus Jessup, a newspaper editor in Fort Beulah, and his growing concern about the possibility of Fascism gaining a foothold in America. In the second section, politics and the encroachment of Fascism on the state of Fort Beulah are observed, leading to the election of the President, Berzelius Windrip, in the third section. Windrip is a megalomaniac populist leader whose politics include extreme xenophobia, racism, chauvinism, and opposition to organized labor, education, and the traditional power structures of both the Republican and Democratic parties. His rise to power can be likened to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany. The book's timelessness rests with its narrative of a society's fear of its own destruction, which in this case would come in the form of a political movement seemingly beyond its comprehension and control. It warns of the potential crisis posed by authoritarianism in the United States and the danger in blindly trusting figures of authority. Though unsuccessful commercially, the novel has been praised for its prescience and its warning against the rise of Fascism and authoritarianism. The novel remains a staple of high school reading lists and is widely recommended by academics and foreign policy experts as one of the most relevant books of its time.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 201227}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charles Ray Hatcher\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Charles Ray Hatcher (July 16, 1929December 7, 1984) was an American serial killer who confessed to having murdered 16 people between 1969 and 1982.\n\nChildhood and youth\nCharles Ray Hatcher was born in Mound City, Missouri, a small town  north of St.Joseph. He was the youngest of Jesse James and Lula Novada (Bomar) Hatcher's four children. His father was a bootlegger, an ex\u2011convict and an abusive alcoholic. Hatcher was bullied in school, and in turn bullied his classmates and would carry this practice into adulthood.\n\nIn the spring of 1935, he and his older brothers were flying a kite with copper wire they had found in an old ModelT Ford. His oldest brother, Arthur Allen, was about to hand the kite to him when it hit a high\u2011voltage power line and electrocuted him. Arthur was pronounced dead at the scene. Soon afterward, his father left home and divorced his mother. His mother remarried several times, and in 1945, Hatcher moved with his mother and her third husband to St.Joseph.\n\nCrimes\n\n1947\u20131963\nIn 1947, Hatcher was convicted of auto theft in St.Joseph after stealing a logging truck from Iowa\u2013Missouri Walnut Company, his employer of two weeks. He received a two\u2011year suspended sentence. In 1948, he was convicted of auto theft a second time for stealing a 1937 Buick in St.Joseph. Hatcher was sentenced to two years in the Missouri State Penitentiary.\n\nOn June 8, 1949, Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little more than half of his time. He was back in prison in just a few months, after being convicted of forging a $10 check at a gas station in Maryville, Missouri. On March 18, 1951, Hatcher escaped from prison and attempted a burglary. He was caught and received an extra two years in prison.\n\nAfter serving his additional time, Hatcher was released from prison on July 14, 1954. He stole a 1951 Ford in Orrick and was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison. Before he was sentenced, Hatcher attempted to escape from the Ray County Jail in Richmond and received an additional two years. On March 18, 1959, Hatcher was released from prison after the sixth prison sentence of his life.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, Hatcher attempted to abduct Steven Pellham, a 16\u2011year\u2011old in St.Joseph who delivered newspapers, threatening him with a butcher knife. Pellham reported the crime, and Hatcher was arrested when the police stopped him in a stolen vehicle.\n\nHatcher was sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary for the attempted abduction and auto theft under the Habitual Criminal Act. While Hatcher was waiting to be transported to prison, he unsuccessfully attempted to break out of the Buchanan County Jail. When Hatcher arrived at the Missouri State Penitentiary, he claimed to be the most notorious criminal in northwest Missouri since Jesse James.\n\nOn July 2, 1961, a 26-year-old inmate named Jerry Tharrington was found raped and stabbed to death on the floor of the prison kitchen loading dock. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the back. Hatcher was the only individual missing from the kitchen crew at the time of the murder. He was sent to solitary confinement for Tharrington's murder, but there was not enough evidence to convict him in court.\n\nWhile in solitary confinement for the murder, Hatcher wrote a note claiming that he needed psychiatric treatment; however, the prison psychologist felt that it was simply a scheme to get out of solitary and possibly out of prison early. Treatment was refused, and Hatcher was returned to the general population. His sentence was reduced to three\u2011quarters the original time, and he was released on August 24, 1963.\n\n1969\u20131977\nHatcher confessed to abducting a 12\u2011year\u2011old named William Freeman in Antioch, California on August 27, 1969. He claimed he had told the boy to come with him, took him to a creek, and strangled him.\n\nOn August 29, 1969, six\u2011year\u2011old Gilbert Martinez was reported missing in San Francisco. According to the six\u2011year\u2011old girl with whom he was playing, Martinez walked away with a man who offered him ice cream. He was found by a man walking his dog as the boy was being beaten and sexually assaulted. Police arrived and arrested the assailant, who identified himself as Albert Ralph Price, although he carried identification with the name Hobert Prater. Martinez survived the assault, and Federal Bureau of Investigation records later identified the man as Charles R. Hatcher.\n\nStill going by the name Albert Price, Hatcher was charged with assault with attempt to commit sodomy and kidnapping. He was ordered to undergo competency evaluations to determine his competence to stand trial. A complete psychological evaluation was ordered when Hatcher was unresponsive during the preliminary evaluations. During this time, he claimed to hear voices, and faked delusions and suicide attempts to avoid prison.\n\nIn December 1970, Hatcher was sent back and forth between the courts and hospital multiple times. One psychiatrist diagnosed him as having a passive\u2013aggressive personality with paraphilia and pedophilia. It was reported that the hospital staff felt Hatcher was fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of his mental disorders. He was examined by two psychiatrists in January 1971. He was declared insane by the first one, who recommended vigorous treatment in a secure hospital. The second psychiatrist declared him to be incompetent to stand trial and sent him back to the hospital.\n\nOn May 24, 1971, Hatcher was sent to trial and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was sent to a different hospital for more evaluations, where it was determined that he was unfit to stand trial. On June 2, Hatcher escaped from the hospital. He was caught a week later in Colusa, California and arrested for suspected auto theft under the name Richard Lee Grady. Hatcher was returned to the California State Hospital for a mental evaluation. In April 1972, hospital staff determined that his treatment was unsuccessful and that he was a danger to other patients, after which he was sent to the prison state hospital in Vacaville.\n\nIn August 1972, Hatcher was transferred to San Quentin State Prison to stand trial, three years after the crime. He was ordered to undergo two final examinations: one declared him competent to stand trial and the other determined him to be sane at the time of the crime.\n\nIn December 1972, Hatcher was tried for, and convicted of the abduction and molestation of Martinez. In January 1972, he was committed to the California State Hospital as a \"mentally disordered sexual offender\".\n\nOn March 28, 1973, security guards found Hatcher hiding in a cooler near the hospital's main courtyard with two sheets stuffed into his pants, after which he admitted to an escape attempt. He was sent back to court for sentencing after doctors determined he was still a threat to society. In April, Hatcher was sentenced to one year to life and sent to a medium\u2011security prison in Vacaville.\n\nIn May 1973, a psychologist found Hatcher to be a \"manipulative institutionalized sociopath\". In June 1973, he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists after it was recommended that he be transferred to a maximum security prison. A psychiatrist diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia, and he remained at Vacaville.\n\nIn August 1975, guards reported good behavior at Hatcher's parole review. In June 1976, the California Parole Board found that Hatcher had improved dramatically through his time in prison and set a parole date of December 25, 1978. As a result of the passage of a bill giving inmates credit for time spent in jails and mental hospitals, Hatcher received a modified parole date in January 1977. He was released to a halfway house in San Francisco on May 20, 1977.\n\n1978\u20131982\nOn September 4, 1978, Hatcher was arrested under the name Richard Clark in Omaha, Nebraska for sexually assaulting a 16\u2011year\u2011old boy. He was sent to the Douglas County Mental Hospital and released in January 1979.\n\nOn May 3, 1979, Hatcher was arrested for assault and attempted murder after he tried to stab seven\u2011year\u2011old Thomas Morton. He was sent to Norfolk Regional Center, a mental health facility, after the charges were dropped.\n\nIn May 1980, Hatcher was released from the facility, but was sent back two months later for another assault. He escaped in September.\n\nOn October 9, 1980, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Lincoln, Nebraska for the attempted assault and sodomy of a 17\u2011year\u2011old boy. He was sent to another mental health facility and released after 21 days.\n\nOn January 13, 1981, Hatcher was arrested as Richard Clark in Des Moines, Iowa after a knife fight. He spent time in several mental health facilities and was released to a Davenport Salvation Army shelter in April.\n\nMelvin Reynolds\nOn May 26, 1978, four\u2011year\u2011old Eric Christgen disappeared from downtown St. Joseph, Missouri. His body was later found along the Missouri River; he had been sexually abused and died of suffocation. The police questioned more than 100 possible suspects, including \"every known pervert in town\", to no avail.\n\nOne of them was Melvin Reynolds, a 25\u2011year\u2011old man of limited intelligence who had been sexually abused himself as a child and who had homosexual experiences as an adolescent. Reynolds, although agitated by the investigation, cooperated through several interrogations over a period of months, including two polygraph examinations and one interrogation under hypnosis. In December 1978, he was questioned under amobarbitalbelieved at the time to be a truth serumand made an ambiguous remark that intensified police suspicion. Two months later, in February 1979, the police brought the still cooperative Reynolds in for another round of interrogation: fourteen hours of questions, promises, and threats. Finally, Reynolds gave in and said, \"I'll say so if you want me to\".\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Reynolds embellished this confession with details that were fed to him, deliberately or otherwise. That was enough to convince the prosecutor to charge Reynolds, and to convince a jury to convict him of second\u2011degree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Four years later, Reynolds was released when Charles Hatcher confessed to three murders to an FBI agent, including that of Eric Christgen.\n\nDeath\nOn July 29, 1982, 11\u2011year\u2011old Michelle Steele was reported missing from St.Joseph. The day after, her uncle found her nude, ravaged body on a bank of the Missouri River. She had been beaten and strangled to death.\n\nHatcher was arrested the following day, as he tried to check in at the St.Joseph State Hospital. While awaiting trial, he confessed to fifteen other murders dating from 1969. The first victim, 12\u2011year\u2011old William Freeman, had disappeared from Antioch, California in August of that year, one day before Hatcher was charged with child molestation in nearby San Francisco. In another case, Hatcher penned a crude map that led searchers to the remains of 28-year-old James Churchill, buried on the grounds of the Rock Island Army Arsenal, near Davenport, Iowa. It was then that he also confessed to the murder of Eric Christgen.\n\nHe was convicted of the Christgen homicide in October 1983, and drew a term of life imprisonment with no parole for at least 50 years. Facing his second Missouri conviction a year later for the murder of Michelle Steele, Hatcher requested a death sentence, but the jury refused, recommending life on December 3, 1984. Four days later, Hatcher hanged himself in his cell, at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City.\n\nSee also \n List of serial killers in the United States\n List of serial killers by number of victims\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCited works and further reading\n \n \n\n1929 births\n1984 suicides\n20th-century American criminals\nAmerican escapees\nAmerican male criminals\nAmerican murderers of children\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican people convicted of theft\nAmerican people who died in prison custody\nAmerican prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment\nAmerican rapists\nAmerican serial killers\nAmerican sex offenders\nEscapees from Missouri detention\nFugitives\nLGBT people from Missouri\nMale serial killers\nPeople convicted of murder by Missouri\nPeople from Mound City, Missouri\nPeople from St. Joseph, Missouri\nPeople with antisocial personality disorder\nPrisoners and detainees of California\nPrisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Missouri\nPrisoners who died in Missouri detention\nSerial killers who committed suicide in prison custody\nSuicides by hanging in Missouri\nViolence against men in North America", "machine_text": " Charles Ray Hatcher (1919\u20132005) was an American entrepreneur and philanthropist who, through his various business ventures over the course of his long life, made great contributions to the communities of Georgia and Alabama in which he lived.

The building was designed by I. M. Pei & Partners (now Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) together with now defunct BEP Akitek (Pte) Singapore and started construction in 1975. Its construction period was only two years due to a three-tier system. The building was completed on 1 October 1976 and was Southeast Asia's tallest building at the time. A bronze sculpture designed by Tan Teng Kee sat at the building until 1983 when it was moved to the now defunct Bras Basah Park. Large Reclining Figure, a large bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, replaced it in 1984, and a new plaza and reflecting pool were built outside the front entrance of the building. The building has undergone several modernisations and OCBC Centre East and South was constructed at a later date.\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is an example of Brutalist architecture, a popular architectural style in the 1970s.\n\nIt is designed to be a symbol of strength and permanence, and its structure consists of two semi-circular reinforced concrete cores as well as three lateral girders which helped make construction faster. The building is divided into three sections due to the steel trusses being  constructed off-site and were put into position. Each section consists of floors that are cantilevered 6 metres from each column, with load transfer girders spanning at each end taking up boxed sections of the pre-stressed concrete. Lattice steel models strengthened by steel and  concrete compression was installed on the 20th and 35th floors of the building.

In addition to serving as a marina and social club, the Washington Yacht Club has advocated for the environmental protection of the Anacostia, which at one point was one of the most polluted rivers in the United States.\n\nThe group's clubhouse and surrounding property were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.\n\nHistory \nThe Washington Yacht Club was founded on April 27, 1910, by a group of motorboat enthusiasts. Its initial members were white residents of the area east of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. They were \"proudly working class\" boaters who often built their boats by hand. Samuel Masson was the club's founding commodore.\n\nThe organization was unusual among boating clubs in D.C. at the time for its sole focus on motorboats.\n\nWYC was located at the bottom of Naylor Road SE from its founding until 1915, then relocated to near the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge pier, where they built a clubhouse. They were forced to move again in 1924, this time across from the east bank of the river to the west bank, settling at the club's current site at 1500 M St. SE. In early 1925, members towed the clubhouse across the river, where it stands to this day.\n\nBesides the clubhouse, constructed in 1915, elements of the current site that are historically significant include a 1955 workshop, a 1920s electrical shed, and a portion of the Anacostia seawall.\n\nMembers of the yacht club served as on-call marine security during World War II. WYC members also contributed to environmental stewardship of the Anacostia River, reporting polluters and assisting with river cleanup from as early as 1923.\n\nNevertheless, the Anacostia became extremely polluted throughout the 1900s. Meanwhile, the city's racial layout shifted, with black residents increasingly shunted east of the river. John \u201cSonny\u201d McLean became the first non-white member of the Washington Yacht Club in the 1970s. His membership was limited, however, as he was not allowed in the clubhouse except during important meetings and events. Subsequently, many white members left WYC in reaction to both the club's increasing African American membership and the high levels of river pollution. It has since been described as \"one of the oldest African-American yacht clubs in the country,\" though it is open to members from all backgrounds.\n\nWomen also began to join as individual members in the 1970s. Peggy Appellis, the first female individual member, also became the club's first female commodore in 1977.\n\nIn 2011, a fire destroyed four boats at the club.\n\nPresent day \nThe club sits along \"Boathouse Row\" in southeast Washington, within Anacostia Park. It is a member of the Historic Anacostia Boating Association.\n\nSteve Ricks is the club's longtime commodore.\n\nWYC applied for historic preservation status for its clubhouse and grounds, arguing, \"The Washington Yacht Club clubhouse epitomizes not only the resilient spirit of Anacostia boating, but to some degree, that of people of Washington as well.\"\n\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 2, 2020.\n\nReferences \n\n1910 establishments in Washington, D.C.\nClubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\nYacht clubs in the United States\nAnacostia River", "machine_text": " Washington Yacht Club is a private yacht club located on the Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle, Washington.

The site has been dated to between 545-1045 AD and its location at the top of the mountain indicates it was possibly a defensive site or stronghold. The site consists of a fortress around which a number of dwellings and ceremonial buildings were constructed. The complex is rectangular in shape and is made up of various buildings including plazas, residences, temples, cisterns and a possible control tower. The main structure consists of three stories and stone walls, with the lower level free of any structures. The top two levels have dwellings and other structures, including platforms and ramps. The site was likely an important religious and political centre in the Inca culture. It is believed to have been used for rituals and ceremonies, as well as for the storage of supplies. There is also evidence to suggest it was used as a defensive structure during times of warfare. The site has been excavated and studied for a number of years, revealing a number of important artifacts and insights into Inca life and culture. In 2019, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, recognizing the site as an exceptional example of the Inca's engineering prowess and a \"unique expression of elements fundamental to the Inca identity\".

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 12, 2004.\n\nThe episode was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by Joel H. Cohen.\n\nPlot\nAfter losing his last baby tooth, Bart does not enjoy playing with his toys anymore and feels that he is maturing. To get out of his depression and express his emotions, Bart writes sarcastic and insulting phrases on his T-shirts. The shirts make him popular in town, and Bart sets up a stand in front of his house selling them. His business is shut down for not having a vending license, and he goes to a retailer's convention to obtain one. While leaving, he meets Goose Gladwell, a Willy Wonka-type salesman who sells joke products. Bart agrees to sell his shirts at Gladwell's store, making him the primary source of income in the family after Homer quits his job.\n\nFearing that Bart has replaced him, Homer decides to nurture Lisa. They quickly bond, and Homer sees her entry for the science fair: a history of nuclear physics and a scale model of the first nuclear reactor. However, Martin shows them his project, a childlike robot. Homer helps Lisa ensure her project's victory by stealing plutonium from the power plant and building a working Class II plutonium fission reactor. Meanwhile, Bart learns that Gladwell has sold the rights to the shirts. Homer stands up for Bart by threatening to detonate his nuclear reactor and destroy Gladwell's store. Gladwell accepts defeat, giving Bart and Homer all the money he has. As they leave, Bart thanks Homer for straightening things out.\n\nCultural references\nThe title of the episode references the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: \"Fat Man\" is the name of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, and \"Little Boy\" was the one dropped on Hiroshima. At the start of the episode, Lisa and Janey sing \"Miss Susie.\" Bart finds that the Tooth Fairy has donated in his name to the United Way of America, rather than giving him a quarter. The toys that Bart disposes of are based on Spirograph, Etch A Sketch, Hungry Hungry Hippos, Monopoly, Parcheesi, Silly Putty, and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. He gives his toys a Viking funeral, and the Sea Captain quotes Robert Frost's poem \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\". Marge and Homer list \"support our troops\" and \"Keep On Truckin'\" as examples of T-shirt slogans. Moe asks if Bart has any T-shirts with \"Calvin peeing on Hobbes.\" This references the newspaper comic Calvin and Hobbes, and a series of bootleg stickers depicting Calvin urinating on various logos and symbols. The designs on Krusty's T-shirt line include Itchy dressed as Austin Powers, SpongeBob SquarePants, and a Confederate, and Scratchy modeled after Osama bin Laden. Lisa's model of science history contains displays of scientists Marie Curie, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, and Albert Einstein. Goose Gladwell looks similar to Willy Wonka from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and he sells the rights to Bart's shirts to The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe episode features various real-life songs. \"Dust in the Wind\" by Kansas plays as Bart carries his toys to the ocean, and \"I'm Too Sexy\" by Right Said Fred is heard over a montage of Bart walking around town with his shirts. The introduction to Krusty's T-shirt display is accompanied by \"Get Ready for This\" by 2 Unlimited. Gladwell's car horn is a variation of \"La Cucaracha.\" \"The Pink Panther Theme\" is set to a scene of Homer sneaking into the power plant.\n\nReception\nReviewStream wrote that \"only the Simpsons can combine a Willy Wonka look-a-like[sic], a Robert Frost poem, and a Viking funeral all into one episode.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nThe Simpsons (season 16) episodes\n2004 American television episodes", "machine_text": " Fat Man and Little Boy are two supporting characters featured in the animated television sitcom The Simpsons.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Internal wave\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Internal waves are gravity waves that oscillate within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface. To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.\n\nInternal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.\n\nVisualization of internal waves\nAn internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.\n\nAtmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.\n\nUndulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the Strait of Gibraltar).\n\nBuoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency\nAccording to Archimedes principle, the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density  surrounded by an ambient fluid of density . Its weight per unit volume is , in which  is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, , gives the definition of the reduced gravity:\n\nIf ,  is positive though generally much smaller than . Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface gravity wave feels nearly the full force of gravity (). The displacement of the thermocline of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves.\n\nWhereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as . Suppose a water column is in hydrostatic equilibrium and a small parcel of fluid with density  is displaced vertically by a small distance . The buoyant restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by\n\nThis is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about  in time about with frequency given by the buoyancy frequency:\n\nThe above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, , of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle  to the vertical:\n\n.\n\nThis is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle  to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the buoyancy frequency is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies.\n\nMathematical modeling of internal waves\n\nThe theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below.\n\nInterfacial waves\n\nIn the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density  overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density . Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at  The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be irrotational. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a velocity potential,  and the potential itself satisfies Laplace's equation:\n\nAssuming the domain is unbounded and two-dimensional (in the  plane), and assuming the wave is periodic in  with wavenumber  the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in . Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is\n\nand\n\nwith  the amplitude of the wave and  its angular frequency. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the dispersion relation:\n\nin which the reduced gravity  is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers:\n\nwith  the Earth's gravity. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water surface waves by setting\n\nInternal waves in uniformly stratified fluid\n\nThe structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the Boussinesq approximation). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are\n\nin which  is the perturbation density,  is the pressure, and  is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by  and , a constant, is the characteristic ambient density.\n\nSolving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form  gives the dispersion relation\n\nin which  is the buoyancy frequency and  is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical.\n\nThe phase velocity and group velocity found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right.\n\nInternal waves in the ocean\n\nMost people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the ocean, internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the continental shelf regions of the world oceans and where brackish water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves.\n\nInternal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.\n\nProperties of internal waves\n\nInternal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than surface gravity waves because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively.\n\nThe atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: potential density generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, as a result of varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave mode may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide.\n\nAt large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, there may be evanescent internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides. Similarly, atmospheric tides arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with diurnal motion.\n\nOnshore transport of planktonic larvae\nCross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering meroplanktonic larvae to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences.\n\nInternal tidal bores\nSimilarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave \u201cfeels the bottom,\u201d water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore. Internal waves are often formed as tides pass over a shelf break. The largest of these waves are generated during springtides and those of sufficient magnitude break and progress across the shelf as bores. These bores are evidenced by rapid, step-like changes in temperature and salinity with depth, the abrupt onset of upslope flows near the bottom and packets of high frequency internal waves following the fronts of the bores.\n\nThe arrival of cool, formerly deep water associated with internal bores into warm, shallower waters corresponds with drastic increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations and changes in plankter species abundances. Additionally, while both surface waters and those at depth tend to have relatively low primary productivity, thermoclines are often associated with a chlorophyll maximum layer. These layers in turn attract large aggregations of mobile zooplankton that internal bores subsequently push inshore. Many taxa can be almost absent in warm surface waters, yet plentiful in these internal bores.\n\nSurface slicks\nWhile internal waves of higher magnitudes will often break after crossing over the shelf break, smaller trains will proceed across the shelf unbroken. At low wind speeds these internal waves are evidenced by the formation of wide surface slicks, oriented parallel to the bottom topography, which progress shoreward with the internal waves. Waters above an internal wave converge and sink in its trough and upwell and diverge over its crest. The convergence zones associated with internal wave troughs often accumulate oils and flotsam that occasionally progress shoreward with the slicks. These rafts of flotsam can also harbor high concentrations of larvae of invertebrates and fish an order of magnitude higher than the surrounding waters.\n\nPredictable downwellings\nThermoclines are often associated with chlorophyll maximum layers. Internal waves represent oscillations of these thermoclines and therefore have the potential to transfer these phytoplankton rich waters downward, coupling benthic and pelagic systems. Areas affected by these events show higher growth rates of suspension feeding ascidians and bryozoans, likely due to the periodic influx of high phytoplankton concentrations. Periodic depression of the thermocline and associated downwelling may also play an important role in the vertical transport of planktonic larvae.\n\nTrapped cores\nLarge steep internal waves containing trapped, reverse-oscillating cores can also transport parcels of water shoreward. These non-linear waves with trapped cores had previously been observed in the laboratory and predicted theoretically. These waves propagate in environments characterized by high shear and turbulence and likely derive their energy from waves of depression interacting with a shoaling bottom further upstream. The conditions favorable to the generation of these waves are also likely to suspend sediment along the bottom as well as plankton and nutrients found along the benthos in deeper water.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nOther\n\nExternal links\nDiscussion and videos of internal waves made by an oscillating cylinder.\nAtlas of Oceanic Internal Waves - Global Ocean Associates\n\nAtmospheric dynamics\nFluid dynamics\nWaves\nWater waves", "machine_text": " Internal wave, also known as internal Tide, is a gravity wave generated within a fluid medium and composed of regions of higher and lower density. Such waves are generally created by variations in temperature, salinity, and/or background flow. Because of their intrinsic nature, they act as a means of energy propagation and transformation within the ocean, atmosphere, and other bodies of water. History The earliest evidence of the internal wave's existence comes from the 19th century astronomer William Rutter Dawes and his experiments with sound in water. His work demonstrated that the sound would travel in a wave-like pattern and pass through layers of higher and lower density water. This eventually led scientists to believe that such waves could propagate through ocean waters. In 1851, the Austrian physicist Christian Ludwig von L\u00fctzen discovered internal waves through photographic observations in the Bay of Naples and Dublin. His photographs, which graphically illustrated the processes of refraction, reflection and interference, were the first observations of internal wave processes. Dynamics Internal waves are generated by changes in either the density of a fluid medium (density-driven) or by variations in the background flow (state-flow-driven). Density-driven internal waves can be created as a result of thermal or salinity stratification, where the medium consists of regions of different densities due to a decrease or increase in temperature or salinity. On the other hand, state-flow-driven internal waves are generated by the presence of an external force or by a variation in the pressure exerted on the system by an external agent. The nature of an internal wave depends on the wavelength, amplitude, and frequency of the wave. Wavelength determines the amount of energy associated with a given wave while the amplitude determines how far into a fluid medium the wave penetrates; frequencies between 0.001 and 10 Hz are typically associated with internal waves. The largest internal waves are often observed in the world's oceans and can extend a length of over 400 kilometers. Effects Internal waves can affect various natural phenomena at different scales. At the local scale, internal waves can influence the properties of a body of water, such as its temperature and salinity, thus affecting its chemical and biological composition. At the regional scale, these waves can trigger powerful currents known as the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) which circulate throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. At the global scale, internal waves are capable of affecting the ocean-atmosphere boundary. This boundary is the interface between air and water which directly influences global climate patterns and weather. Particularly, internal waves can alter atmospheric wind patterns, as well as heat transport and the distribution of precipitation in the atmosphere. Additionally, internal waves have the ability to redistribute energy from the lower to the upper layers of the ocean, thereby playing a role in the world's climate by affecting its thermohaline circulation. Conclusion Internal waves, whether density- or state-flow-driven, are a unique type of gravity wave which propagate within a density stratified medium. Such waves possess various effects at different scales, ranging from local sensory changes to larger-scale interactions such as wind patterns. Understanding the dynamics and properties of internal waves can provide valuable insight into the processes occurring in the atmosphere and ocean, ultimately providing a better understanding of the climate system.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 900160}

The rocks are believed to be the remains of a Paleozoic-age granodiorite intrusion, which is estimated to be up to 42 million years old. The rocks form a wide variety of shapes, ranging from small outcrops to large blocks, with numerous layers visible in some areas. They are predominantly composed of quartz, feldspar, and biotite, with lesser amounts of mica, hornblende, and various other minerals. One of the most striking features of the Milev Rocks is their abundance of fossils, including trilobites, brachiopods, and sponges, as well as many other types of organisms. As a result, the rocks have long been a source of fascination for geologists, paleontologists, and other scientists. The Milev Rocks are also an important source of building materials, including sand and gravel as well as road and agricultural lime. The rocks have been mined in the area since the 19th century, and they are still widely used today. Milev Rocks have also obtained some notoriety in recent years due to the popularity of rock climbing. The area offers many climbs of varying difficulty, ranging from single-pitch sport climbs to multi-pitch explorations in the area's pristine and spectacular limestone canyons. The area is seen as an emerging potential center for climbing in Bulgaria and the rest of the world, and more and more climbing clubs and organizations are visiting the area each year. The Milev Rocks have also become an important archaeological site, with numerous discoveries made in recent years.

It contributes to conservation and research through links with conservation projects and its links with universities in nearby Liverpool, as well as Chester and Manchester.\n\nHistory\nThe park was opened in July 1971 by Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby and Jimmy Chipperfield using the expertise of general manager Laurence Tennant MBE, formerly the Chief Game Warden of Parks in Uganda and Botswana. Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional  of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars.\n\nThe park was also home to a former RAF airfield which closed at the end of World War II. The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 \u2013 November 1944.\n\nThe park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Benthem v Netherlands\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Benthem v Netherlands was a European Court of Human Rights case on the right to a fair trial. It concerned the grant of a permit by a municipal authority, with which the Dutch Government, then referred to as the Crown in legal cases, disagreed. Several legal proceedings were brought in respect of this permit, which were ultimately decided by the Government itself, under the  procedure ('Crown appeal').\n\nBenthem eventually filed an application before the Court and claimed that the Government had denied him the right to a fair trial of  of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), arguing that the Government was not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\". The Court held that there was a violation of  ECHR.\n\nThe ruling of the Court led to substantial changes of Dutch administrative law, most notable the elimination of the  and the establishment of a separate court procedure.\n\nFacts\nAlbert Benthem used to own and run a garage in Noordwolde, Netherlands. In , he applied to the municipal authorities for a permit to establish and maintain an installation for the delivery of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), following the Nuisance Act (Hinderwet). After the application was made public, three neighbours were concerned about the safety of the installation. A regional health inspector recommended to deny Benthem's application. Despite the health inspector's advice, the permit was granted, albeit with several conditions to counter possible dangers.\n\nThe health inspector lodged an appeal with the Government, the so-called . The municipality informed Benthem of this appeal, but stated he could still erect his installation. The Council of State, after hearing both parties and seeking advice from the Director General for Environmental Protection, gave the Minister of Public Health the recommendation to refuse the licence. Consequently, the Government (the Crown) held that the permit should not have been granted and quashed it by royal decree.\n\nDuring that time, Benthem had already established the LPG installation. The municipal authorities ordered him to cease operation. His appeal against that decision, which was also a , was denied by decree. The municipal authorities eventually decided to close the installation themselves. An appeal against that second decision was quashed on formal grounds by the Council of State.\n\nBenthem filed an application with the European Commission of Human Rights. He claimed that a dispute over civil rights and obligations was involved and his case should have been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal as guaranteed under the right to a fair trial of  ECHR. \n\nThe Commission held that  of the Convention was not applicable to his case. Both the Government and Benthem appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. By that time, Benthem had been declared bankrupt.\n\nJudgment\nThe Court held that there was a violation of  ECHR.\n\nIt first assessed the applicability of Article 6(1), namely whether the dispute at hand concerned the \"determination of [the applicant's] civil rights and obligations\". The Dutch Government argued that the case at hand did not, since it failed to relate directly to the conclusion of contracts, to the right to enjoy one's property (since the Nuisance Act conditions this right), or to the right to carry out business activities (since Benthem could continue to sell LPG on a different site presenting less risks). On the contrary, the case concerned a 'new' and provisional right created by means of a license, which the Crown could therefore reverse. These conclusions were shared by the Commission. On the contrary, the Court established the existence of a genuine and serious dispute that concerned the \"actual existence\" of the right to a permit, which affected Benthem's ability to exploit his installation. This right to a permit has a civil character, since it is closely associated to the applicant's right to use his possessions and the exercise of his commercial activities.\n\nSecondly, the Court considered the proceedings in front of the Council of State and the proceedings in front of the Crown. The Government argued that the Council of State acted as a court because it examined all the aspects of the case and came to a decision (provided the likelihood that the Minister of Public Health would follow its recommendation to the letter). However, the Court assessed that the Council of State only provides advice without binding force and could therefore not fulfill the role of tribunal with regards to Article 6(1). As for the appeals the Crown, the Court considers them of administrative rather than judicial nature, since the royal decree is an administrative act not susceptible to review by a judicial body, and the appeals were not lodged to an independent body.\n\nThus, the Court held eleven votes to six that Article 6(1) was both applicable and violated, and Benthem had been denied a right to a fair trial.\n\nExternal links \n ECtHR October 23, 1985, No. 8848/80 (Benthem v Netherlands)\n\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights\nEuropean Court of Human Rights cases involving the Netherlands", "machine_text": ". Benthem v Netherlands is a 2004 case decided at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that established the government's obligation to protect individuals from hate groups. The case was brought by Mr. Bbignascimento Benthem, a Dutch citizen who was the victim of a hate crime in 1996. The incident occurred when Mr. Benthem was walking through a park in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. He was wearing a hoodie which identified him as a member of a religious minority. He was attacked by a group of individuals who were shouting racist chants. Although Mr. Benthem reported the incident to the police, no investigation was conducted into the attack. Mr. Benthem then brought a case against the Dutch government alleging a violation of his human rights. He argued that the government had failed to protect him from violence, as required under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECDHR). This states that no person shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The ECHR decided in a 5-2 majority in favor of Mr. Benthem, finding that the Dutch government had failed in its obligation to prevent violence against individuals based on their membership in a particular group. The court held that any hate group that threatens or engages in violence should be prosecuted and that the police should promptly investigate incidents of hate crime. In its judgment, the court stressed that governments have an obligation to protect their citizens from violence, regardless of any prejudicial attitudes that may arise from the victims\u2019 lifestyle or the reasons for which they are attacked. This decision was subsequently enshrined in Article 9 of the European Union\u2019s Framework Directive on Racism and Xenophobia, which states that member states must take appropriate and effective measures to combat hate crime. Since the Benthem case, the Dutch government has increased its efforts to address hate crimes, with the government expanding its initiatives to provide protection for vulnerable communities and introducing tougher penalties for perpetrators of hate crimes. The Benthem decision remains an important precedent, as it established the obligation of European governments to protect individuals from hate crimes. The ruling also highlights the need for governments to undertake effective investigations into hate-related incidents, ensuring that those who perpetrate hate crimes are brought to justice and that victims receive justice and appropriate support.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25450422}

The Estates are situated on the border of the city of Cynthiana and the unincorporated village of North Middletown. Located on the Kentucky River, the community is surrounded by rolling hills and pastures, making its the perfect rural retreat. The origins of Maryhill Estates can be traced back to the mid-1800s, when the area was home to a small community of farmers. By the turn of the century, the area had become a bustling center of trade, with a number of businesses and manufacturing facilities setting up shop. The primary business of the day was the production of coal tar and coke byproducts. As the demand for coal tar and coke grew, more businesses and farms were established in the region, and the population of the area began to swell. The area was first developed into a residential community in the early part of the 20th century, when a group of local real estate developers bought up a portion of land and began the process of subdividing it into residential lots. The development was publicly marketed as a \u201cSatellite Town\u201d for Cynthiana in 1929, and construction began soon after. The new homes quickly attracted a number of affluent professionals, who were looking for a quieter, more rural setting. The combination of the rich agricultural resources, beautiful scenery, and proximity to Cynthiana soon made Maryhill Estates a popular place to call home.

His doctoral dissertation was entitled \u201cSelf-Diffusion in Alpha Solid Solutions of Silver-Cadmium and Silver-Indium.\u201d After completing graduate work he was employed (between 1957 and 1967) as a research physicist by aerospace companies in California, and also worked as a free-lance solid-state physics consultant. In 1967, he took the position of senior scientist at NASA's Electronics Research Center (ERC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he did geometry research and served as the Chief of the Office of Geometrical Applications. While at NASA, he also worked on expandable space frames. In 1970, Schoen accepted a position at California Institute of the Arts, where he taught calculus and computer graphics. In 1973, he accepted a teaching position in the Department of Design at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), where he taught computer graphics, algebra, and analytic geometry to design students. This was a former home department of Buckminster Fuller - an American designer and inventor who popularized the geodesic dome. In 1982, Schoen accepted a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematics and Department of Computer Science at SIUC. In August 1985, he moved to the SIUC campus in Nakajo, Japan, where he taught a course in computer science and also helped to teach English at a local Japanese junior high school. Upon his return to Carbondale in 1988, he taught FORTRAN and Digital Design in the Electrical Engineering Department at SIUC until his retirement in 1995. After retiring from academia he continued his work on numerous infinite families of minimal surfaces and on inventing geometric puzzles and images.\n\nContributions\nAlan Schoen is best known for discovering (while working at NASA) a minimal surface that he named the gyroid. The name stems from the impression in the gyroid's structure that each continuous channel in the array, along different principal crystallographic axes, has connections to additional intersecting channels, which \u201cgyrate\u201d along the channel length. The gyroid has become popular among scientists as more and more new occurrences of it in nature are being discovered.\nEarlier in his career, while conducting his doctoral research on atomic diffusion in solids (1957), Schoen discovered that for self-diffusion in crystalline solids, there is a simple relation between the Bardeen-Hering correlation factor and the isotope effect that makes it possible to distinguish between vacancy and interstitial diffusion mechanisms. He later found evidence from a FORTRAN program that his equation is exact in all close-packed cubic structures. His finding was soon confirmed algebraically by Tharmalingam and Lidiard. Schoen's preoccupation with this subject eventually led him to an interest in minimal surfaces and the discovery of the gyroid.\n\nAlan Schoen has also published scientific papers on families of minimal surfaces, and books on geometric images and puzzles. In the early 1990s, Schoen designed Rombix \u2014 a combinatorial dissection puzzle, which uses multicolored tiles that are composites of 8-zonogons, to create various designs.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bob Arbogast\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Robert \"Bob\" Arbogast (April 1, 1927 \u2013 March 21, 2009) was an American radio broadcaster, voice actor, and television host.\n\nEarly life and education\nBob was born in Bellingham, Washington, the only child of Lewis, a champion tennis player, stockbroker, World War One veteran under an assumed name, and World War Two Coast Guard volunteer and Christine Arbogast, a champion tennis player.  Bob attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles where he was on the league-champion tennis team and was graduated in 1944.  Upon graduation, he enlisted in the navy. His unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Bronze Star for bravery for a multi-ship raid into Tokyo Bay.  He was demoted from Signalman 3rd class to Seaman 1st class when his commanding officer told him to hop to it and Bob proceeded to jump up and down on the deck of the USS Brush. At the train station in Atwater Village (Glendale), upon his return from the South Pacific theater, he saw the coffins of many of his classmates from Marshall High who had died, and did not live to see a world without war. When the war ended, he attended Los Angeles City College and then the University of Arizona on the GI bill. A radio program director from WHB in Kansas City heard Arbogast's nighttime show on the university's radio station and hired him immediately.\n\nCareer\nBob went to Chicago's WMAQ where he worked with Pete Robinson from 1951 to 1953 (using as a theme song a charming version of Sicilian Tarantella played on an ocarina) before moving to Los Angeles for a time, then returning to Illinois where he worked at WEAW in Evanston, Illinois. Then he went to New York where he wrote for two shows, one featuring Tom Poston and another Peter Marshall. Then he worked at San Francisco's KSFO and KFRC. He later worked at many stations in Los Angeles including KMPC from 1962 to 1967, KLAC in 1967, KFI in 1968, and KGBS in 1969.\n\nAt KMPC, he wrote for Dick Whittinghill and Gary Owens, and he wrote with and was the partner of Jack Margolis at KLAC and KGBS.  Their radio talk show at KLAC had the highest rating of any radio program in LA history up until that time (and perhaps still), with a 14.5 percent share of the audience.  Due to a concentrated letter-writing campaign, they were fired for their objection to the Vietnam war and their pro-choice stance.  They may have been among the last fired due to the McCarthy dealings of the 1950s.  The pair also hosted a TV show on KTTV for a while.\n\nArbogast created the Question Man in Kansas City in 1951 and used it on the Poston Show in NY. It was later a feature on The Steve Allen Show, to the surprise of Bob and Steve - as Allen acknowledged in his book, The Question Man.  The concept lived on in Johnny Carson's Carnac the Magnificent and Jeopardy!.\n\nIn 1958, Arbogast teamed with Stanley Ralph Ross to write and perform the hit 45 rpm single \"Chaos, Parts 1 and 2,\" which when it came out (on Liberty Records #55197), sold 10,000 copies in three days, and then was banned from radio play on the fourth day - when stations realized that it satirized \"Top 40\" radio.  Dr. Demento has kept \"Chaos\" alive. In addition, they co-wrote the album of parody songs titled My Son, the Copycat (a take on Allan Sherman's albums) and the book Speak When You Hear the Beep.\n \nArbogast had numerous screen credits for cartoons and commercials and had appeared on television shows and in movies. He did frequent uncredited voiceovers for Sesame Street segments. He was the voice for the original \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\" advertising campaign and of the animated Granny Goose for the Granny Goose potato chip campaign (What is Granny's secret?  I won't say...\") Among hundreds, Arbogast is perhaps most famous for his voicings of General G.I. Brassbottom, Noodles Romanoff, and Ma Ramjet in the Roger Ramjet cartoon, Jack Wheeler in the Hot Wheels cartoon, and Snogs on the Hanna-Barbera animated series Monchhichis. He also voiced several characters in the Hanna-Barbera series The Jetsons. Not to be forgotten were Arbo's stylings of Barry Bear and Drummy Drummer, popular seventies pull-string toys - \"I'm Barry Bear, like to meet my paw?\"  \"I'm Drummy Drummer.  I went to school at the school of hard knocks.\" - and his renditions of hamburgers in early McDonald's commercials. While in elementary school at Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles, his son John was scolded when asked by his teacher, Mrs. Horowitz, what his father does for a living. John replied, \"he is a bear.\" Refusing to recant, a meeting with the teacher, principal, and Bob resulted in free hot dogs on \"Hot Dog Wednesday\" for John for a year. John also has many voices still running on Sesame Street.  In 1966 he appeared in the campy horror film \"Batwoman\".\n\nOne of his most popular bits was his portrayal of little old lady Emily Norton for KMPC.\n\nAmong his many TV and radio commercial partners were Pat Harrington, Harry Morgan, Doris Roberts, Joan Gerber, Edie McClurg, Bob Elliott, Albert Brooks, Shelley Berman, Tim Conway, Lorenzo Music, Gene Moss and Casey Kasem.\n\nArbogast won an Emmy as a writer for Stars of Jazz in 1958 and a Clio in the '70's, for the Highland Appliance Co. of Detroit. He wrote for Sesame Street and The Pat Paulsen Show. He also has the dubious distinction of writing for the shortest-lived television show ever, Turn-On, which was canceled after one night because it satirized, among others, the Pope. He co-starred (had two lines and 6 minutes on camera) with Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in the motion picture The Falcon and the Snowman and he drove the bus in Linda Lovelace for President.\n\nArbogast was a jazz aficionado, Chicago Cubs and UCLA Bruins fan, and animal lover.  He and his wife, Jan, lived in Mariposa, California, tending to their garden, caring for their pets, and the pleasures of the internet, satellite radio and television.  With his previous wife, Joanna, he raised a daughter and three sons. His oldest son Peter is the radio voice of USC Trojan football. His middle son John is a USC honors grad, a decorated Coast Guard officer, retired Los Angeles city park ranger, history teacher, city champion pole vault coach and assistant track and field coach at John Marshall High School. His youngest son Jerry is a UCLA graduate and a retired physical education teacher and tennis coach in the Los Angeles Unified School District. His daughter Paula retired in June 2006 from her position as a teachers' union representative. With his first wife, Tobi, he had a son, Robert Jr. (Ted), an accomplished musical director and band leader, and the technology coordinator for Terlingua High School in Texas.

He was selected in the fourth round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, but would later go on to play for the Chicago Cardinals and the Los Angeles Rams. His most prominent moment in NFL history came during the 1958 NFL Championship Game when his touchdown reception for the Giants from quarterback Charlie Conerly was the winning score in a 23-17 victory over the Baltimore Colts. Arbogast began his football career at Muskegon High School in Michigan, where he was part of the 1947 team that was crowned Ohio Valley football champions. He attended several college and universities in his academic career, including the University of Michigan, where he played for two years as a running back for the Wolverines. After his time at Michigan, Arbogast returned to Muskegon in 1953 where he became the starting quarterback on the high school football team. He would later go on to lead his team to an undefeated season and a league championship. In early 1954, Arbogast was drafted by the New York Giants as the 35th overall pick in the NFL Draft. He didn't get off to the best of starts with the Giants, appearing in only four games in his first NFL season. He would continue to struggle and after the 1956 season he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals, where he played for two more seasons before moving on to the Los Angeles Rams in 1959. Arbogast's big break came in 1958 during the NFL Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts. During the game, he caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Charlie Conerly, which ultimately proved to be the winning score for the Giants. The \"Catch\" as it came to be known, is seen as one of the most iconic plays in NFL history. Arbogast retired after the 1960 season, finishing his career with 1,374 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. Since his death in 2014, Arbogast's contributions to the Giants have been honored by the team. The Bob Arbogast Award has been given to an outstanding wide receiver for the Giants since 2016. Arbogast was a beloved figure in Muskegon, Michigan, and to the many fans of the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, and his legacy will continue to be remembered for years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4723941}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"NDUFAF5\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 5, also known as Arginine-hydroxylase NDUFAF5, or Putative methyltransferase NDUFAF5, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. A mutation in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.\n\nStructure \nNDUFAF5 is located on the p arm of Chromosome 20 in position 12.1 and spans 36,554 base pairs. The NDUFAF5 gene produces a 30 kDa protein composed of 267 amino acids. The presumed structure of the c-terminal of the protein has been found to resemble that of the known secondary structure of RdmB. NDUFAF5 contains the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase domain, which contains the GxGxG signature sequence, and the S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which are common in most SAM-dependent methyltransferases. This arginine-hydroxylase is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages. Complex I is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped manner. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.\n\nFunction \nThe NDUFAF5 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is associated with the matrix face of the mitochondrial inner membrane and is required for complex I assembly. Their role is integral to co-factor insertions and in utilizing sub-assemblies for building complex I. It does so by catalyzing the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in the NDUFS7 subunit of human complex I, which occurs before the peripheral and membrane arm juncture formation in the beginning stages of complex I assembly. The NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, and consists of at least 43 subunits. The complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Though the exact biochemical function of NDUFAF5 is not yet known, mutations in this gene results in mitochondrial complex I deficiency. NDUFAF5 is also known to be a member of the 7\u03b2-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases.\n\nClinical significance \nMutations in NDUFAF5 is known to result in mitochondrial diseases and associated disorders. It is majorly associated with a complex I deficiency, a deficiency in the first complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Suppression of the NDUFAF5 gene has been found to lead to the loss of both peripheral and membrane arms of complex I associated with NDUFS7 and ND1. This then leads to the progressive loss of complex I, causing the deficiency. Such disorders involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Mutations in NDUFAF5 has also been common patients with Leigh syndrome, an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of focal, bilateral lesions.\n\nInteractions \nIn addition to co-subunits for complex I, NDUFAF5 has protein-protein interactions with NDUFAF8 (for stabilization), and NDUFS7.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n \n \n \n \n\nHuman proteins\nGenes on human chromosome 20", "machine_text": ". NDUFAF5 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein found in humans and other animals. It is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase family of proteins and is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and function as part of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein is encoded by the NDUFAF5 gene and is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial energy production. The NDUFAF5 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, consists of four exons, and encodes an outer-membrane protein of the same name. This gene has been linked to a mutation in the human NDUFAF5 gene associated with Leigh Syndrome. Leigh Syndrome is a severe neurological disorder which is caused by a defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. NDUFAF5 is a member of the NADH-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase family and, like all members of this family, it is a component of the electron transfer system within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the ubiquinone pool, and therefore plays an important role in energy production within the mitochondria. Functionally, NDUFAF5 has been shown to have an essential role in the assembly of the respiratory complex I. Specifically, it acts as a scaffold protein which binds the iron-sulfur clusters of the complex to the membrane at the interface. As such, NDUFAF5 is thought to be important for the efficient assembly of complex I and for its proper functioning. In addition to the role that NDUFAF5 plays in the assembly of complex I, it has been suggested to play a regulatory role in this evolutionary ancient enzymatic pathway. Specifically, it has been proposed that the interaction of NDUFAF5 with complex I is partially regulated by post-translational modification of NDUFAF5, suggesting that it may play a role in controlling the levels of complex I assembly and its activity. Overall, NDUFAF5 is an important mitochondrial membrane protein involved in electron transport, energy production and complex I assembly. Furthermore, the mutation of this gene has been suggested to result in Leigh Syndrome, highlighting the importance of NDUFAF5 in the healthy functioning of cells and organisms.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58004903}

These dynasties subdued the areas east of the Saale river inhabited by Polabian Slavs, and took the tribal name Sachsen (Saxons) upstream the Elbe with them. \n\nIt was particularly to distinguish the lands from 'Lower Saxony', a concept which arose later in popular usage (though never enforced) as a term for the original Saxon lands in north and west Germany (where Low German dialects had spread), in what is now the state of Lower Saxony, as well as the adjacent Westphalian region, Holstein and the western part of today's Saxony-Anhalt north of the Harz range (Eastphalia). \n\nAccording to the Golden Bull of 1356, the Saxe\u2013Wittenberg lands up the Elbe formed an Electorate, which in 1423 merged with Meissen under the Wettin dynasty and headed the Upper Saxon Circle. The Wettins acquired the Lusatia region by the 1635 Peace of Prague and finally were elevated to Kings of Saxony in 1806. Thus the citizens of the present-day German state of Saxony today are simply known as Saxons. This is true of the media, though the East Central German dialects of Upper Saxon (Mei\u00dfenisch and Osterl\u00e4ndisch) are placed in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon continuum.\n\nExternal links\nObersachsen\n\nGeography of Saxony", "machine_text": " Upper Saxony (German: Ober Sachsen) is the regions of Germany located on the northern edge of the country bordering eastern Netherlands, including the cities of Erfurt and Dresden. Upper Saxony comprises several historical states including the Principality of Reuss, the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the State of Thuringia. The region also includes the northern part of Saxony-Anhalt, the eastern part of Saxony-Anhalt and a small portion of the Franconian region of Bavaria. Upper Saxony was established in 1945 as part of the Allied powers occupation of Germany following the end of World War II. The term is derived from the traditional name of the historical area of Upper Saxony and the Federal State of Saxony. Lower Saxony, which is located to the west, is the region that the origins of the name are based from. The dominant landscape of Upper Saxony is shaped by rivers, low rock formations and plateaus. It includes several nature reserves, including Unesco World Heritage Site Thuringian Forest, mountain ranges of the Rh\u00f6n, Ore, Franconian, Thuringian and low mountain ranges as well as parts of the Elsterberg. The economy of Upper Saxony is primarily based on its services sector and its manufacturing and industrial output is among the highest in the country. It is an important economic center and one of the five German economic regions. In 2015 the region grossed a total of \u20ac93 billion in gross domestic product and accounted for 10.7% of Germany's total economy. Automotive, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering are the main industries in the region. Upper Saxony is home to a number of institutions of higher education, including the University of Erfurt, the University of Applied Sciences in Erfurt, and the Dresden University of Technology. Culture in the region is rooted in the traditions of the Saxons of Prussia, as well as a range of other cultural influences. Throughout the region, festivals and concerts to celebrate traditional music, theater and film take place throughout the year. The region is also home to the Theater Erfurt, a renowned concert hall, as well as several world-famous historic attractions. Given its proximity to the Netherlands and Central Europe, Upper Saxony is a popular destination for tourists. Dresden, one of the most visited cities in Germany, is a center for culture and art and is known for its monuments from the time of the Saxon kings. The city also boasts many historic sites, museums and churches, alongside a lively nightlife and excellent shopping. Overall, Upper Saxony is an economically prosperous area as well as a vibrant center for transportation, industry and culture.

Built at Brest on private plans by Pierre Ozanne, she was particularly fast. The French Navy adopted the design and copied the plans as late as 1848. Originally armed with 6-pounder guns, she was later rearmed with heavier carronades. She continued in service, off and on, until she was struck in 1854.\n\nService history\n\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\nDiligente took part in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 in Leiss\u00e8gues' squadron, culminating in the Battle of San Domingo.\n\nThe frigates , , and Diligente captured and burned the American vessel Lark, Moore, master, which was sailing from Philadelphia to Jamaica.\n\nIn August 1808 Diligente, captained by Commander Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lemaresquier, with the corvettes  and Espi\u00e8gle, sailed from France with supplies for the island of Martinique. British ships chased the group through the Bay of Biscay and captured Sylphe and Espi\u00e8gle. Diligente escaped, only to encounter the British sloop , under Commander (later to be Admiral) Charles Napier, off Antigua. During a hard-fought action lasting three hours, Recruits mainmast fell, putting her somewhat at Diligentes mercy. However, a lucky shot ignited Diligentes ammunition store, causing some damage.  Diligente withdrew and later Lemaresquier justified his action on the grounds that other British naval vessels were approaching, which they were not, and the weight of Recruits broadside, which was heavier.\n\nOn 3 October, Diligente sank the Mexican brig Juliana. Then on 12 November she returned to Lorient. Here she served from 1811 to 1812 as a school ship. On 12 March she was in the harbour at Brest. On 2 December 1812, she accidentally collided with  in the Roads of Toulon.\n\nShe may have cruised in the Channel as  reported that on 20 December 1813 she had retaken and sent in the brig Racehorse, from Newfoundland for Teignmouth, that the French corvette Diligente had captured. In 1814 Diligente was paid off.\n\nBourbon Restoration\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, Diligente underwent refitting at Brest between 22 August 1820 and 4 January 1821. She was recommissioned with 18-pounder carronades and was reclassified as a corvette aviso (sloop corvette). Then on 21 April she left Brest for the Antilles, Guiana and Newfoundland. By 30 August 1822 she was in the Antilles again.\n\nOn 2 November 1822 Diligente left Rochefort for Brazil, not returning to Brest until 27 December 1826. Around 1825 or so she was off the coast of Chile where she took a privateer that had fired a broadside at her.\n\nIn 1827 Diligente was again decommissioned for refitting. Then in 1828 she was in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nJuly Monarchy\nUnder Commandant Garibou Diligente took part in the expedition to the mouth of the Tagus River where a French squadron fought the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831. The French vessels fought their way past the Portuguese forts guarding the mouth of the river and sailed up to Lisbon. There they forced the Portuguese king Dom Miguel to accede to French demands, among them that he recognize the July Monarchy. The French also seized all the military and commercial vessels they could find as reparations.\n\nThen in 1835\u201336 Diligente was on the Livorno station. On 30 January 1836, she was driven ashore and severely damaged at Livorno. On 26 October 1840 she left Toulon for Alexandria, Egypt. She visited Smyrna in March 1841.

Commissioned in January 1801, she initially served as a convoy escort or surveillance vessel during the War of the Second Coalition. By 1803, she had earned notoriety as an effective commerce raider preying on British ships in the Caribbean and off the coast of South America. Constructed at Brest, France, Diligente was a medium-sized four-masted sail-powered corvette. She had a length of 106 feet (32 m), a beam of 31 feet (9.4 m), a draft of 14 feet (4.3 m), and had a burthen of 331 tons (339 metric tons). Her armament included 14 cannons and other light weapons. Her inaugural mission was escorting a French convoy from Brest to Rochefort, France during the War of the Second Coalition. In June 1802, while patrolling off the coast of South America, she captured the British merchant vessel Nereus, plunging her crew of 186 into captivity. This was to be the first of several captures she would make in her career as a commerce raider. In August 1802, Diligente was sent to patrol Caribbean waters in search of British merchant vessels. Over the next year and a half, she would capture or otherwise neutralise a total of 38 commercial ships and capture or put to flight 11 warships. Among her greatest successes were the capture of three major British merchantmen, including the Homeward Bound, a large East India Company vessel carrying a cargo of gold and silver. In October 1803, Diligente was to rendezvous with another French commerce raider, the Revenant, before proceeding to France. When the pair failed to meet, Diligente set sail for Europe alone. She managed to elude any naval blockade and arrived safely at Brest in December 1803. Despite her impressive performance, Diligente took no further part in major engagements and was decommissioned following Napoleon Bonaparte's abdication in 1814.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mohicans\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n \nThey combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have a  reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived:  (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\"). The word  refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. \n\nThe Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the  (or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the \"Snake People\", as they were called by some competitors, or \"Five Nations\", representing their original tribes).  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on  in Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.\n\nTerritory\nIn their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , \"people of the great tidal river\".\n\nAt the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.\n\nMost of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.\n\nCulture\nThe Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).\n\nA general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.\n\nLike the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).\n\nLanguage\nThe now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.\n\nHistory\n\nMohican Confederacy\nThe Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.\n Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, \"the fireplace of the Mahican Nation\") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George\n , lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek\nWawyachtonoc (or ,  \"eddy people\" or \"people of the curving channel\"), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, Scaticook\n Westenhuck (from , \"on the other side of the mountains\"), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the \"Housatonic people\", they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning \"the place downstream\"\n Wiekagjoc (from , \"upper reaches of a river\"), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New York\n\nConflict with the Mohawk \n\nThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.\n\nIn September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed the  upriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.\n\nThe Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.\n\nWar continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahn\u00e9htati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.\n\nStockbridge\nMany Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the \"Stockbridge Indians\". , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.\n\nThe Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.  In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).  During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village of  in Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half \"Stockbridge Indians\" who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.  It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid $1,000 and dismissed.\n\nMove to Oneida, New York\nAfter the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted a  reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.\n\nRemoval to Wisconsin\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.\n\nLand claims\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for  in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly  in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.\n\nIn 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.\n\nRepresentation in media\nJames Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.\n\nNotable members\n Etow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.\n Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757\u20131830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captain\n Steve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activist\n Brent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautist \n Bill Miller, (b. 1955) musician\n Electa Quinney, (1798\u20131885) first public teacher and school mistress in Wisconsin\n John Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797\u20131855) diplomat\n Don Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.\n\nSee also \n Native American tribes in Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Aupaumut, Hendrick.

They are a subgroup of the Munsee branch of the Algonquin and are members of the Iroquois. The word \u201cMohican\u201d was a term used by colonists to falsely refer to the tribe. It is said to be derived from a mischoice of the tribe\u2019s traditional self-ascription Mahikander, which translates to \u201cthe people of the great river\u201d as they originated in areas adjacent to the Hudson river. Mohicans historically spoke the Munsee dialect of Algonquian language. Through European colonization and contact, the Mohican descended into poverty and dispersed around the United States and Canada. By the late 19th century, most of their language and customs were gone due to assimilation. Due to their move of location, the Mohicans have many similarities with their Munsee and Lenape counterparts. Historically, the typically semi-nomadic tribes had villages of longhouses which were clustered around the area of the Hudson Valley, stretching from present-day New York to Berkshire County, Massachusetts. As well as these, other villages were known to have been built in Vermont and southern New Hampshire. Culturally, the Algonquian-speaking Mohicans largely based their beliefs around nature and their environment, paying homage to their doctrines in the woods and rivers, thus creating a spiritual bond between both. Traditionally, they were known to have hunting and fishing rituals, using apparel and weapons made from materials such as stone, flint, and animal pelts. The iconic image of the Mohican is heavily linked to the colonial novel Last of the Mohicans written by James Fenimore Cooper in 1826. The novel, which has been adapted into a film and a miniseries, has helped gave the tribe a type of celebrity status and appreciation, particularly in the United States. Moreover, the Mohicans have since began to heavily reconverge in the state of Wisconsin. The Mohican Nation of Wisconsin Federal Court decision in 1994 established the tribe's political autonomy, allowing them to set up tribally-owned lands, implement their own laws and guidelines, and self-identify as Native Americans. In modern day, the Mohican are still recognized as a Federally-recognized tribe, having maintained their status as citizens throughout many major changes in American history. Today, the Mohicans are celebrated as a cultural group, being known for their advocacy of environmental causes, their participation in pow-wows and other ceremonies, and preserving the culture and language of their ancestors for future generations.

It is mainly concerned with the concept of \"substantive identity\" in which a particular being is constituted of a single essence, often referred to as a \"thing\". This philosophy was developed in the late twentieth century, and originally presented to the public in the book \"Things and Other Things: A Study of Substantive Identity\" (1989). The book looks at the various questions of identity that arise when attempting to unify seemingly disparate parts of reality. Questions such as \u201cin what sense an entity is the same as something else, or in what way is it distinct\u201d are explored and discussed in great detail. The heart of the philosophy is the concept of substantive identity which asserts that each thing is composed of two distinct parts \u2013 the individual and the universal. Thus, each particular thing has its own identity based on its component parts, yet in some sense can still be seen as a part of something larger \u2013 the collective and infinite \u201cotherness\u201d of objects and events. This is often referred to as the \u201cinfinitely divisible identity\u201d of things, or the \u201contological puzzle of inter-particular relations\u201d. In addition to the notion of substantive identity, Katz and his colleagues also discuss a related concept of \u201cextrinsic difference\u201d. This relates to the idea that each thing is not only intrinsically different from all other things, but it is also inextricably linked to all other things through its \u201cother\u201d. Thus, each individual object or event is intrinsically different, yet cannot exist independently, but must exist in relationship with all other things or events. Katz and his colleagues stress that rather than seeing things as existing independently, or existing in relation to the collective, we should consider them as existing in a dual relationship \u2013 both connected to and distinct from the universe of things and other things. Thus, in their view, the concept of \u201cthings and other things\u201d helps us to understand the complexities of reality, and better understand the relationship between the particular and the universal. In conclusion, the philosophy of \u201cThings and Other Things\u201d provides a distinct framework for understanding the complexity of existence, and offers an alternative to more rigid philosophical conceptions of identity. By showing how each particular thing is linked to the greater whole, Katz and his colleagues demonstrate how we can better comprehend our relationship to the irrational and the infinite.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 46723020}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Austin Armoured Car\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Austin Armoured Car was a British armoured car produced during the First World War. The vehicle is best known for its employment by the Imperial Russian Army in the First World War and by different forces in the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn addition to the British-built Austins, a few dozens of vehicles were manufactured in Russia in 1918\u201320. These are usually referred to as Austin-Putilov or \u2013 if fitted with a K\u00e9gresse halftrack chassis \u2013 Austin-K\u00e9gresse.\n\nProduction history\n\nBritish Austins\n\nIn August 1914, just after the beginning of the First World War, the army of the Russian Empire started to form armoured car units. Due to limited production capabilities of the country's automotive industry it was decided to order a number of vehicles abroad. A committee was sent to the United Kingdom, but failed to find an armoured car that met their requirements for overhead protection and two machine gun turrets.\n\nTo meet these requirements, the Austin Motor Company designed a new armoured car. The vehicle, known as Austin 1st series, was based on a passenger car chassis with rear-axle drive. Wheels were wooden, spoked, with pneumatic tyres and an additional set of wheels with full rubber tyres for use in combat was carried. Two Maxim machine guns were mounted in separate turrets placed on both sides of the hull behind the driver's cab. The vehicle was protected by armour plates 3.5\u20134\u00a0mm thick screwed to a body frame. The crew of four \u2013 commander, driver and two gunners \u2013 could enter or leave the vehicle via a door on the left side of the cab or via big two-leaf rear door. On 29 September 1914, 48 armoured cars were ordered. One car cost 1,150 pounds. After arrival in Russia the front and turret armour was replaced with 7\u00a0mm plates. First combat experience, however, revealed that the protection was still too weak and the vehicles were fully rearmoured at Izhorski Works, Izhorsk. The improved armour made the Austins much heavier, resulting in limited mobility and occasionally in chassis damage. However, the car was still considered more successful than alternative designs by, among others, Armstrong Whitworth, Renault and Sheffield-Simplex.\n\nOn 6 March 1915 the Russians ordered 60 vehicles of an improved design, known as Austin 2nd series. This time the chassis of a 1.5 ton truck with a more powerful engine was used. The hull was shorter, with thicker armour, the driver's cab roof was modified to improve machine guns' angle of fire. Less welcome was a removal of rear access door. The army also decided it wanted a rear driving post, so after arrival to Russia all vehicles were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section, which housed a second driving post and additional hatch. Another upgrade was the addition of side shields to the machine guns.\n\nSixty units of Austin 3rd series were ordered on 25 August 1916. The vehicles were similar in characteristics to the 2nd series, but had modified rear hull with driving post, MG shields, bulletproof glass in the front vision slots and lacked big side windows.\n\nYet another version, with strengthened chassis and double rear wheels, sometimes referred to as Austin model 1918, was ordered in 1917 but due to events in Russia none were delivered.\n\nRussian Austins\n\nIn 1916 a decision was made to produce a Russian armoured car on the well known Austin chassis. Sixty chassis units \u2013 identical to those used in 3rd series \u2013 were ordered from Austin. The mission of building armoured hulls was entrusted to Putilovski Works, Saint Petersburg. It was planned to build the cars by July 1917, but work was virtually brought to halt by the February Revolution and the subsequent chaos. Not until March 1918 were the first cars produced. Later the production was transferred to Izhorski Works. A total of 33 vehicles were produced in 1918\u20131920. In contemporary Russian documents the model was referred to as Russian Austin (Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d \u2013 Russkij Ostin), but eventually became better known as Austin-Putilov (Russian: \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d-\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 \u2013 Ostin-Putilovets).\n\nTwelve hulls identical to those of Austin-Putilov were mounted on a K\u00e9gresse halftrack chassis, resulting in vehicles known as Austin-K\u00e9gresse. Production continued from July 1919 until March 1920 when it was stopped by shortage of materials and parts.\n\nRussian Austins' most obvious features were diagonally placed MG turrets (in order to reduce width) and additional right side door. They also had MG mounts with better elevation and other minor improvements.\n\nService history\n\nRussia\n\nArrival of the 1st series Austins allowed the formation of automobile machine gun platoons (Russian: \u043f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0451\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u2013 pulemyotniy avtomobilniy vzvod or \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0451\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u2013 avtopulemyotniy vzvod). First platoons (5\u201312), formed according to the organization no. 19, each had three Austins, four staff cars, a truck, a workshop truck, a tanker truck and four motorcycles, with personnel of four officers and 45\u201346 soldiers. Further platoons (13\u201324, 26\u201328, 30\u201336), formed according to the organization no. 20, received only two Austins, but had a gun section consisting from a gun-armed Garford-Putilov Armoured Car, a staff car, a truck and a motorcycle. Platoons 5 to 12 received an additional Garford. Crews of those auto-MG platoons were entirely drawn from volunteers. Most of the platoons were used in the Western and South-Western Fronts, some platoons in the Northern Front and Caucasus. In combat they were attached to divisions or regiments.\n\nBy mid-1916 it was evident that larger units should be formed to make armoured cars more effective. In August, platoons were arranged into twelve \"armoured automobile battalions\" (Russian: \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d \u2013 bronyevoy avtomobilniy divizion or \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d \u2013 avtobronedivizion), each attached to a specific army. Each battalion was formed from two to five former platoons, which were renamed to sections whilst retaining the old number. In some cases, for example in the Caucasus theatre, the platoon organization was retained.\n\nIn the Russian Civil War Austins were used by many participants, including both Red and White armies, Ukrainians etc. The Red Army had the largest number of vehicles, including all the Austin-Putilov and Austin-Kergesse vehicles and most of the 3rd series. In Soviet service the cars were organized into \"armoured automobile units\" (Russian: \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0434 \u2013 bronevoy avtomobilniy otryad or \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0434 \u2013 avtobronevoy otryad), similar in strength to a World War I-era platoon: three machine gun-armed cars and one either gun-armed or machine gun-armed, four staff cars, five trucks, a tanker truck, a workshop truck and four motorcycles. The RKKA Austins also saw combat in the Polish-Soviet War. By 1921 the RKKA possessed about 16 Austins of the 1st series, 15 2nd series, 78 3rd series and Putilovs. British-built Austins were removed from service by 1931, and by 1933, the Russian-built ones were also retired.\n\nThe Austin-Putilov armoured car named Vrag Kapitala (Enemy of the Capital), on display at the Artillery Museum, Saint Petersburg, is often referred to as the vehicle which Lenin stood on to address the crowd in April 1917. However, it cannot be true as this armoured car was only manufactured in 1919.\n\nOther users\n\nBritish\nSixteen of the Austins built for Russian but not sent following the revolution were used to equip the 17th (Armoured Car) Battalion of the Tank Corps. The Vickers machine guns were exchanged for the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun, which was the standard machine gun of the British tank unit. The 17th Battalion arrived in France in April 1918. Its first operations were in support of the French Army in June. It returned to the British Army in August and was very successful at the Battle of Amiens. The Austins were towed in pairs by tanks across the mud of no-man's-land. Once they reached better ground on the other side of the lines, they ranged freely. A German Corps headquarters 10 miles back was captured and German reserves, artillery and supply lines were shot up. Having crossed the German frontier at Malmedy, Belgium, on 1 December 1918 after the Armistice, the 17th was the first British unit to enter Cologne on the Rhine on the 8th, escorting the Commanding Officer of 2nd Cavalry Brigade to negotiate Allied control of the city.\n\nAfter the war, the bodies were reused on Peerless lorry chassis. Some of these were still in service at the start of the Second World War.\n\nSome cars were sent to the Caspian Sea region. Austins were also used by the British in the Irish War of Independence.\n\nVariants\n Austin 1st series (or model 1914) \u2013 based on a passenger car chassis with 30\u00a0hp engine and rear axle drive. Wheels wooden, spoked. 3.5\u20134\u00a0mm armour, eventually replaced with 7\u00a0mm plates. Weight with original armour 2.66 ton. Road speed 50\u201360\u00a0km/h. Road range 250\u00a0km.

Road range 100\u00a0km. 12 built.\n Armoured hulls of damaged Austins were sometimes (mostly during the Russian Civil War) mounted on other chassis, usually White, Fiat or Packard. The combination of White chassis and Austin hull is sometimes referred to as White-Austin.\n\nOperators \n\n The last active Austin was probably the vehicle employed by the Austrian Army until 1935.\n\n At least one car was captured at the Dobruja Front at 17 November 1916 by the Bulgarian Armed Forces.\n\n Estonian Army used two captured Austin-Putilovs, named Tasuja and Suur T\u00f5ll.\n\n Two Austins 3rd series, initially sent by the Soviets in 1918 to help the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War, were taken over by the Finnish Army, which used them until the mid-1920s.\n\n Armed forces of Democratic Republic of Georgia operated several Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n Few captured vehicles were used during World War I on both fronts. Four vehicles, two 2nd Series and two 3rd Series, were used in 1918-1919 by the Freikorps armoured unit Kokampf (Kommando der Kampfwagenabteilungen) formed in Berlin as Kampfwagen Abteilung K\u00f6rting to suppress the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 in Berlin, Munich and Leipzig.\n\n A small number of Austin model 1918s were imported by the Japanese Army, where they remained in service until the early 1930s.\n\n Latvian Army used one Austin 2nd series, named Zemgaleetis (Zemgalietis in modern spelling), captured from the Soviets during the Latvian War of Independence.\n\n Two or three cars were given by the Soviets to the Mongolian People's Army in the early 1920s.\n\n Polish Armed Forces captured up to 20 Austins from the Soviets during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. Some were subsequently employed by the Polish. Five remained in service after the war, some until the 1930s.\n\n At least one Austin and four Austin-Putilovs were used by the Romanian Army.\n\n The Imperial Russian Army was the main user of Austin Armored Cars and after the end of the First World War the vehicles went to the Bolsheviks, White Russians, Georgia and Ukraine, among others.\n\n Vehicles taken over by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army initially went into action in the Russian Civil War, and were later used to suppress independent republics established in the former Russian Empire.\n\n Ukrainian People's Army operated unknown number of Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n British Army\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n M.

The vehicle was designed for use by a small number of crew and was unique in that its armament could be changed from a machine gun to an anti-tank gun. It was primarily used by the British Army and was used in various theatres of war from North Africa, to the Far East. The Austin Armoured Car was developed in 1935 as a response to the expanding and increasingly troublesome polarised global powers of the time. Austin\u2019s first model of armoured car was the AC1, which was equipped with a four-cylinder engine and two water-cooled Vickers machine guns. Soon after, an AC2 and AC2a were produced which featured the latest engines and had a range of effective armour and armament. The AC2 and AC2a were soon succeeded by the Austin MK I and MK II armoured cars. These improved vehicles featured a six-cylinder engine, revised armour and armament as well as modifications to the transmission system. The final version of the Austin Armored Car was the MK III, which had an eight-cylinder engine, increased fuel capacity and a range of anti-tank ammunition. The Austin Armoured Car and its derivatives saw extensive service in World War II and saw action during the North African, Italian and Far Eastern campaigns. The vehicle was even used to help liberate the Falkland Islands during the 1982 Falklands War. The Austin Armoured Car was eventually phased out of active military service in the mid-1960s, but the vehicles continue to be popular among collectors and military history enthusiasts. Modern replicas of the Austin Armored Car are also available for sale and can even be seen at vintage military vehicle shows. The Austin Armoured Car remains one of the most recognizable military vehicles of its era and serve as a reminder of a time of global tension and instability. While no longer serving an active role in international conflicts, the vehicle\u2019s reputation and legacy lives on.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4723660}

Born in then-Prussian territory, Pernau was raised in a military family, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Prussian military framework. He was involved in most of Prussia\u2019s engagements during this period and was influential in development many administrative regulations in the Prussian Army. In 1716 he was named Major General of the Prussian Army and was appointed to oversee strategic planning. He also served as adjutant to the Prussian Soldier, Frederick Wilhelm I. This gave him considerable influence in military circles, and his military innovations and strategic plan were a great part of Prussian success during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was also a prolific writer, publishing on a variety of military and administrative topics for the Prussian Army. After the War of the Spanish Succession, Pernau blossomed as a military tactician and theorist. He published several works on military topics, such as \u201cPassionate Enemy \u2013 A Dialogue on Military Affairs\u201d in 1721. His writings and adaptations of the European military model were read and appreciated far outside of Prussia\u2019s boundaries, and many European countries consulted his works while reforming their own military systems. In 1719 Pernau was appointed Field Marschall and made in 1730 a Count of the empire. Pernau was a devout Lutheran and deeply involved in Prussia\u2019s reform of administration and other public services, including public education. Pernau was instrumental in the development of contemporary Prussia\u2019s administrative and bureaucratic structure. At the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession, Pernau was recalled to the Prussian army and served under the command of King Frederick II during the campaign in Silesia from 1744-1745. He also played a key role in the negotiations of the Treaty of Dresden, signed in 1745. This treaty transferred Silesia to Prussia and was a crucial victory for the Prussian state. After the Treaty of Dresden, Pernau returned to Berlin and was made an Armaments Councilor in 1749. On October 9, 1750, he passed away due to a sudden stroke. This ended an influential career in Prussia's military, which helped shape the Prussian Army during the 18th century. Today, his work is still considered influential and renowned in military, administrative and political circles.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27683271}

This galaxy is the namesake of the NGC 3175 group of galaxies, which includes the spiral galaxy NGC 3137.\n\nThe morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(s)b, which indicates a weakly-barred spiral galaxy (SAB) with no inner ring structure (s), and somewhat tightly wound spiral arms (b). It spans an angular size of , with the major axis aligned along a position angle of 56\u00b0. The plane of the galaxy is inclined at an angle of 77\u00b0 to the line of sight from the Earth, and thus is being viewed close to edge on.\n\nA study of the galaxy using the Australia Telescope Compact Array found that the outer disk of this galaxy, beyond a radius of  from the core, is free of neutral hydrogen emission.

It was discovered on April 26, 1793 by German astronomer William Herschel. NGC 3175 has an apparent magnitude of 10.8 and its distance from Earth is estimated to be about 12,400 light years. The stars in NGC 3175 are organized into a sparse grouping and are spread over an area of 10 arc minutes in the sky. The stars of the cluster range in spectral type from F through G to M, with the majority being late-type stars. In addition to its open cluster stars, NGC 3175 also contains several Herbig\u2013Haro objects. These are formed when material such as gas and dust travelling away from a young star in jets gets slowed down and compressed by the interstellar medium, forming knots and nebulae. Most of the Herbig\u2013Haro objects that have been detected in NGC 3175 are located near the southern edge of the cluster. Most of the stars in NGC 3175 are young, with a median age estimated to be about 6.8 million years. This indicates that the cluster is a relatively young star-formation region. The estimated total mass of the cluster is about 3000 times that of the Sun, with the brightest stars being about 10th magnitude. NGC 3175 is visible with a relatively small telescope, or even binoculars, in a dark sky. It is best viewed in March and April, and can be found within 5 degrees of the planet Uranus, and just over 6 degrees west of the bright star Spica. Despite its relatively close distance to Earth, and its relatively young age, only a few stars in NGC 3175 have been studied in any detail. In particular, the star HD 86134 has been found to be a red giant, and several others have been identified as binary stars. In addition, some stars in NGC 3175 display evidence of rapid rotation, which may be the result of close flybys of neighbouring stars. Due to its relative youth, NGC 3175 may be of particular interest to those studying star formation. A better understanding of the cluster, in particular its Herbig\u2013Haro objects, may provide new insight into how stars form and interact with their surroundings.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 62548982}

Members of the network include river basin organizations (RBOs) from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and the former Soviet Union, those interested in environmental protection that are provided to the Member States by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and representatives from international organizations, such as the UN-Water, UNESCO, World Bank and Ramsar Convention. The main activities of the INBO include the exchange of experiences, knowledge and best practices among its members on the management of transboundary rivers and lakes. Annually, meetings and workshops are organized, usually in the form of round tables or specific technical meetings dedicated to pressing issues, such as women in water management or financing water resources management. In 2020, INBO launched its first work plan 2020-2021 which focused on building capacity amongst its members, as well as developing strategic documents and activities to support the work of basin management, equitable water allocation and the protection of shared ecosystems. The International Network of Basin Organizations serves as a platform for its members to discuss and exchange ideas on common issues related to water and sustainable development. Thanks to the efforts of the INBO, all basin countries now obtain a better perspective of their resources, the state of these resources, and how to sustainably manage them in order to ensure the equity of all.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18300127}

The MOP is divided into two main departments and two main activities. The two main departments are the Office of Planning and Coordination and the General Direction of Inland Transportation. The Office of Planning and Coordination is responsible for coordinating all federal activities related to public works and for analyzing the needs in the areas of transportation, water and sanitation, land management, energy and communications. The General Direction of Inland Transportation is responsible for developing, designing and constructing roads, highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects. The two main activities of the Ministry of Public Works are the elaboration of projects to be carried out by public or private means and the execution of public works in the various areas. The elaboration of projects includes feasibility studies, technical plans and designs, specifications, estimates and tender documents. The execution of public works includes projects such as the construction of roads, bridges, airports, harbors, dams, irrigation systems, electricity plants, water and sanitation systems and telecommunications networks. The mission of the Ministry of Public Works is to guarantee the development of efficient and cost effective public works projects in order to provide quality infrastructure services and products to the Argentine people. The ministry works in partnership with the other levels of government and private entities to contribute to the national development and to promote the efficient use of resources. The Ministry of Public Works is involved in many projects across the country, including large-scale public works such as the Ruiz de Velasco dam and the Alto Paran\u00e1 hydroelectric plant in Corrientes Province. Other large-scale projects in progress include the construction of the Paran\u00e1-Santa Fe railway line and the expansion of the Santa Fe International Airport. The Ministry of Public Works is supervised by the Secretary of Public works, currently Jorge Triaca. The ministry has offices in all 23 provinces in Argentina.

She was later transferred to Puget Sound and became one of the better known steamboats operating there.\n\nConstruction and Early Operations\nShe was built for the run from Portland to Oregon City and was considered one of the top boats on the Willamette River at the time.  One of her early captains was James D. Miller (1830\u20131914).\n\nTransfer to Puget Sound\n\nIn 1889, Multnomah was transferred to Puget Sound, where under the ownership of the S. Willey Navigation Company she made regular runs from Olympia to points on Puget Sound.  In 1900, Captain H.H. McDonald (1857\u20131924), who had already been operating the sternwheelers Elwood and Skagit Queen on the lower Sound, bought Multnomah and Capital City (ex-Dalton) from S. Willey Navigation, and put them in competition with the Greyhound, which had been taken off the Seattle-Tacoma run.  There was a rate war between the two concerns, and eventually Greyhound\u2019s owners, acting as the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, bought Multnomah and Capital City from Captain McDonald.  Captain George W. Barlow, a son of an Oregon pioneer family, commanded all three vessels at various times; he retired in 1910.\n\nIn 1900, Multnomah and City of Aberdeen hauled beer from the Olympia Brewery to various points on Puget Sound.  Once acquired by the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, Greyhound ran with Multnomah on the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia route, making at various smaller landings in the South Sound, including Three Tree Point and Johnson\u2019s Landing on Anderson Island.\n\nOther captains for the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company included George L. Hill, who was in command on  November 10, 1904 when Multnomah collided with the French full-rigged ship Amiral Cecile in Commencement Bay.  In foggy conditions, the steamboat passed under the bowsprit of the ship, and the ship\u2019s anchor flukes caught in the steamer\u2019s upper works, tearing them up.  Litigation went on for eight years over this, amid apparently credible charges that witnesses had been paid off.\n\nIn 1907, Multnomah was converted from wood to oil-fired boilers.  Almost all the boats built after 1905 were oil-fired, and they had improved locomotive-style boilers which lessened the chances of explosion.  The Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company kept both Multnomah and Greyhound on the Tacoma-Olympia run until 1911, when they were replaced with the new express propeller steamer Nisqually.  Even then, bus lines (called then the \u201cauto stage\u201d) were starting to compete with the steamboats.  At some point she was assigned work as a towboat.\n\nCollision and sinking\n\nMultnomah met her end on October 28, 1911, when in a dense fog in Elliott Bay, she was rammed by the steamer Iroquois, sinking in 240 feet of water.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\nHistoric photographs from on-line collections of University of Washington\nMultnomah at Chautauqua Dock, Vashon Island\nMultnomah, apparently on Puget Sound\n\nWebsite\nhistory of sternwheeler Multnomah, with photos and reports of early dives to her wreck\n\nHistory of Washington (state)\nPaddle steamers of Oregon\nSteamboats of the Columbia River\nMaritime incidents in 1911\nSteamboats of Washington (state)\nShips built in Portland, Oregon\n1885 ships", "machine_text": " The Multnomah was a sternwheel steamboat built in 1885 for passenger service on the Willamette and Columbia rivers in the US state of Oregon. The steamboat was one of the largest sternwheelers ever built, measuring 280ft in length and with a beam of 48ft. It had a tonnage of 499 gross and 181 net. The namesake of the ship was the Multnomah tribe of the Chinook Indians, who inhabited the area near the falls of the same name. The Falls were located just east of Portland, Oregon. The Multnomah was built by Capt. George Flavel in Astoria, Oregon at his yard called the Oregon Marine Co. Its first service was in 1885 plying the Willamette and Columbia rivers, operated by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Co. After operating for a few years the Multnomah was laid up. In 1891 the Multnomah was sold to the Oregon-Washington Transportation Co. and placed in service on both Oregon rivers as well as the Snake River. In 1902, the Multnomah was sold to Capt. Adam Hume, who placed it in service between Astoria and Portland. This service was very successful, bringing much needed river freight to Astoria as well as carrying agricultural produce from the surrounding area. During World War II, the Multnomah was taken over by the US government and used as a ferry for troops. After the war, the Multnomah was laid up and eventually sold for scrap in 1950. Today the location where the Multnomah was built stands as a historical site, helping to commemorate this once great sternwheeler. The Multnomah was a unique ship in many ways, especially its size and design. Its size was a testament to the incredible progress made by the steamboat industry during its short history. Its existence, though short, helped to open up Oregon\u2019s rivers to help connect its people and their goods.

He was, most recently, Professor of Political Philosophy in the Department of Government at Georgetown University.  He retired from teaching in December 2012, giving his final lecture on December 7, 2012, at Georgetown;  it was entitled \"The Final Gladness,\" and was sponsored by the Tocqueville Forum. Of his many publications his book Another Sort of Learning (\"a reflection on different aspects of lifelong learning\") has been hailed as exceptional.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Pocahontas, Iowa, and educated in local public schools, he graduated from Knoxville (Iowa) High School in 1945.\n\nAfter time in the U.S. Army (1946\u201347), he joined the Society of Jesus (California Province) in 1948, and then attended Santa Clara University in California.  He earned an MA in Philosophy from Gonzaga University in 1955. He earned a PhD in Political Theory from Georgetown University in 1960, and was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1963.  In 1964, he earned an M.A. in Sacred Theology from Santa Clara University.\n\nFr. Schall was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Social Sciences, Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, from 1964 to 1977, and a member of the Government Department, University of San Francisco, from 1968 to 1977. Among the sources for Schall's lectures were Christian Scripture, Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, G.K. Chesterton, and Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nBefore retiring, he had been a member of the Government Department at Georgetown University since 1977.  In 1993, 2004 and 2010, Fr. Schall was presented the Edward B. Bunn, SJ, Award for Faculty Excellence by the senior class in the College of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University.\n\nSchall retired from his position at Georgetown in December 2012 and moved into the Jesuit retirement home in Los Gatos, California  (on the same property as the location of his old novitiate) where he continued to write books and articles for publications and websites. He also continued to give presentations to small groups on request.\n\nSchall served as a member of the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace, in Rome from 1977 to 1982. He was also a member of the National Council of the Humanities, and a member of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1984 to 1990.\n\nA prolific writer, he wrote more than 30 books and edited or co-edited 8 others.  By July 2002, his website listed his authorship of 356 essays, 148 book reviews, and 660 columns, including his monthly column, \"Sense and Nonsense,\" for the Catholic journal Crisis, and his columns in Gilbert! magazine, the Saint Austin Review, and the University Bookman.\n\nFr. Schall was an expert on the thought of G. K. Chesterton; he edited two volumes of Chesterton's collected works and wrote his own volume of essays on the famous Catholic convert.\n\nSchall was a vigorous supporter of Benedict XVI's critique of western culture which categorizes it as a \"dictatorship of relativism\".  Schall taught that Catholicism is where \"Revelation is addressed to reason\" and stated that \"We are living in a time where the logic of disorder is at work, rejecting systematically the logic of being a human being.\" Schall stated that the societal re-examination of the definition of the family \"is not just an accident,\" but is the culture \"rejecting heavenly answers and replacing them with human answers. A will is leading you, and it says there is something wrong with being human. That goes back to the whole drama of the Fall. C.S. Lewis says the ultimate sin, the ultimate disorder, is to say what is good is bad, what is bad is good.\"  A reporter summed up his statements as \"If we [in society] reject the intelligibility and goodness of creation, will we still be able to hear God\u2019s voice calling us to our supernatural end?\"\n\nMedical issues\nSchall survived a few major illnesses, including one that resulted in the loss of function in one of his eyes. In the summer of 2010 he had a cancerous jawbone and its attached teeth removed and replaced with bone taken from his leg.\n\nWritings (selection)\n\nBooks\nReason, Revelation, and the Foundations of Political Philosophy (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1967)  \nRedeeming the Time (New York: Sheed & Ward, 1968)  LC 68-13845  ASIN: B0006BUD2I\nHuman Dignity and Human Numbers (Staten Island, NY: Alba House, 1971)  \nPlay On: From Games to Celebrations (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971)  \nThe Sixth Paul (Canfield, OH: Alba Books, 1977)  \nWelcome, number 4,000,000,000!

Schall, S.J. (born January 3, 1928 in Walla Walla, Washington) was an American Jesuit priest and political philosopher. He was called one of the \"most influential Catholic political theorists of the 20th century.\" He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Portland, graduating magna cum laude, followed by a master's degree from Gonzaga University. In 1952, Schall entered the Society of Jesus, where he studied at the Jesuit seminary St. Andrew\u2019s Hall at Gonzaga and in 1955 was ordained a priest. He earned a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University in political science. Schall taught political philosophy at Georgetown for thirty-five years, retiring in 1995, and is known especially for his work on classical political philosophy. His books include The Mind That is Catholic (1984), Another Sort of Learning (1988), On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs (1994), The Regensburg Lecture (2003), and A Student\u2019s Guide to Liberal Learning (2004). Schall's works range widely over many areas and topics, such as reflections on the nature of liberal learning, discussions of the relationship between politics and morality, as well as studies of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Edmund Burke, and John Courtney Murray, among others. Despite his vast knowledge of different minds, he opted for wide-ranging criticism of his modern age, instead of providing new positive doctrine. Schall was a consultant to the United States Department of State and a consultant to the 1995 Synod of Bishops of the Catholic Church, and was a member of the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He wrote on topics including the nature of liberal learning, philosophy of science, theological aesthetics, ancient and modern political philosophy, transnationalism and international relations, and globalisation and the loss of cultural identity. Along with his academic works, Father Schall served the Society of Jesus and the Roman Catholic Church. He received The Roman Award of the Order of St. Sylvester in 2005, conferred by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Father Schall published fourteen books and over nine hundred articles in a variety of scholarly journals.

Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman was born in the year 2000 in the United States, to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to Brazil with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States. The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.\n\nBruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a divorce by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer Jo\u00e3o Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody. Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts. \nNew Jersey courts have denied visitation rights for both grandparents months before the grandfather's death.\n\nInternational ramifications\nThe case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level Brazilian and American officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit. The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman Chris Smith (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.\n\nMedia coverage\nOn 30 January 2009, NBC's news program Dateline NBC broadcast a lengthy piece titled \"Fighting for Sean\" on the case and an interview by program's Meredith Vieira with David Goldman, the child's father.\nThe Dateline piece caught the attention of Congressman Chris Smith (R-New Jersey) who contacted the father and offered help. He wrote a major article in The Washington Times on 19 June 2009 titled \"Will Brazil Do The Right Thing\". \nGoldman was interviewed on many media outlets including in Today a few times, on Dr Phil show on 1 December 2008, on CNN's Larry King Live on 4 March 2009, on CTV's Canada AM and on Fox News Channel's On the Record\nThere were public comments on the case by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 4 March 2009 on NBC's Today show and by Brazilian President Lula on CNN on 23 March 2009.    \nOn 15 July 2009, David Goldman testified in front of a Congress committee about child abductions.

The Society of Professional Journalists condemned NBC News for practicing \"checkbook journalism\" by chartering the jet. Mr. Goldman stated in his book, A Father's Love, that NBC had already chartered the jet to fly its news crew home in time for Christmas Day, and when the courts granted him custody on December 24, NBC offered the ride so that he wouldn't have to risk taking a public flight.\nOn 8 January 2010, Dateline NBC broadcast a special on the case upon the successful return of the child to his father. The 2-hour special presented by Meredith Vieira was titled \"Bringing Sean Home: The Untold Story\". Parts of the exclusive interview and shots of the father-son reunion were broadcast on NBC's Today on 28 December 2009.

The child had been living in Butte County, California, with her family, and was forcibly taken against her will by the suspects who intended to ransom her for a substantial sum. The case began on August 11, 1995, when Anju Goldman disappeared while walking home from an ice cream shop in Oroville, California. Her body was eventually found in the Feather River near Oroville on October 8, 1995. Two men, 58-year-old Clarence Eugene \"Gene\" Evans and 59-year-old Paul Leslie Whiteacre, were arrested and charged with her abduction and murder. The trial began in November 1997 and Evans and Whiteacre were found guilty on all charges related to the abduction and murder. Evans was sentenced to life in prison without parole and Whiteacre was sentenced to life in prison with the potential for parole after 20 years. Mason Whiteacre, the brother of Paul Leslie Whiteacre, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the crime and served as a jail informant for authorities. The case drew national attention, due in part to the involvement of then-California Governor Pete Wilson, who called for a total of five million dollars from public and private organizations to fund the search for Anju. It also received media attention due to its grisly nature, as the suspects had planned to ransom the young girl before eventually killing her and disposing of her body in the Feather River. The case was seen as a wake up call to organizations, such as the Amber Alert, that are focused on finding missing children. It led to the introduction of tougher laws in California, making it easier to convict abductors and murderers of children. The Goldman case serves as an important reminder of the threats to children, and the need to remain vigilant in order to protect them.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25603498}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jadwiga Szczawi\u0144ska-Dawidowa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jadwiga Szczawi\u0144ska-Dawidowa (6 October 1864 \u2013 26 February 1910) was a Polish teacher, school founder, writer and women's rights activist. She founded the underground Flying University to provide women with higher education and was the initiator of the efforts to found the Warsaw Public Library. Along with her husband, she founded cultural and educational periodicals and served as both a columnist and editor for the journals until her death.\n\nEarly life\nJadwiga Maria Szczawi\u0144ska was born on 6 October 1864 at 16 \u015awi\u0119toja\u0144ska Street in Warsaw to Bronis\u0142awa Natalia (n\u00e9e Gumpricht, aka Gumbrycht) and Wojciech Albert Szczawi\u0144ski. Her mother was the daughter of a Warsaw hatter and her father, descended from an impoverished family which bore the Prawdzic coat of arms was employed in the administrative service of the police department. Szczawi\u0144ska was the eldest of four children and her siblings included Wand\u0119 Mari\u0119 (1866\u20131955), who would later be a physician; Helena Zofia (1872\u20131931), who would become the first wife of the composer Henryk Melcer-Szczawi\u0144ski; and  (1874\u20131937), later a writer and businessman. Szczawi\u0144ska graduated from the Warsaw Women's Gymnasium in 1880, taking the gold medal for her class. She went on to take her teacher's examination and earned the right to teach in middle school.\n\nCareer\nThough Szczawi\u0144ska was hired to teach for several years at the Second National Feminine Junior High School, she flouted the Russification law which forbade teaching the Polish language in Congress Poland (then subjugated by Imperial Russia). Her defiant nature caused her termination from her post and she began offering private lessons from her home to prepare girls for their exams. Simultaneously, she founded a school in Tokary to teach peasant women how to make basketry. In 1884, she met Jan W\u0142adys\u0142aw Dawid, who was lecturing at clandestine courses. At the time, because the Russian law prohibited a traditional Polish education, which included courses in Catholicism, Polish history, and the Polish language, teachers like Dawid, who wanted to preserve their Polish heritage had to teach in underground circles. \n\nThe following year, Szczawi\u0144ska founded the Uniwersytetu Lataj\u0105cego (Flying University), so named because the school strategically changed locations often to avoid the tsarist police, to offer university courses to women, though men also could attend. Classes were held in private homes and students were cautioned to stagger their arrival times to avoid detection of the gatherings. Monthly pupils paid 2\u20134 rubles per subject for instruction from professors, most of whom had previously taught at the University of Warsaw. Included in the faculty were Odo Bujwid, the first Polish bacteriologist; Piotr Chmielowski, a literary historian; Ludwik Krzywicki, an economist and sociologist; and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Smole\u0144ski, a professor of Polish history. Some of the schools' most noted students were Nobel prizewinner Marie Curie, educator Janusz Korczak, and writer Zofia Na\u0142kowska. \n\nSzczawi\u0144ska headed the Board of the school but came into conflict with other members over whether the school's funding should be spent on social programs or public education. She favored training scholars to be social activists as well as pedagogists, but many on the board differed with her approach and stern manner. These conflicts came to a head during the 1889\u20131890 term, with the faction led by Bronis\u0142aw\u0105 Gutman\u00f3wn\u0105 resigning to form a rival institution. During this same time, on 14 July 1889, Szczawi\u0144ska and Jan W\u0142adys\u0142aw Dawid married at St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw. Though very different in temperament \u2014 he was described by Na\u0142kowska as inattentive, unkempt, and \"never smiling\", while \"she was talkative and full of life\" \u2014 they shared a passion for social improvement, science, and an independent, liberated Poland.\n\nDawidowa began working as a journalist, publishing in such journals as G\u0142os (The Voice) and Przegl\u0105dzie Spo\u0142ecznym (Social Review), using various pseudonyms, including Jotes, Wojciech K\u0142os, J.\u2009S.D., and J. Sz. In 1890, she published K\u00f3\u0142ka rolnicze w Galicji (Agricultural Circles in Galicia), about public education in rural areas. She was especially concerned with social issues writing about topics, among others, such as inadequate funding for student education, poor wages and working conditions for women, women's suffrage, and youth suicide. That same year, Dawidowa led the drive to establish a public library in Warsaw, founding a reading room that offered scientific journals. Three years later, she established a second reading room, inviting scholars to donate materials from their private collections. Within a few months, 6,000 volumes were acquired. To facilitate workers, she ensured that the library was open from 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 a.m. and wrote articles to raise funds to keep it open and maintain the reading room. \n\nIn 1894, tsarist police raided the couple's home and arrested them both for their activities with the Flying University. They were confined in the Tenth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel and held for a week. Upon their release, they returned to their journalistic and educational endeavors with Dawidowa publishing an article, O potrzebie za\u0142o\u017cenia publicznej bibliote-ki w Warszawie (On the Need To Set up a Public Library\nin Warsaw, 1897) in Pedagogical Review and in 1900 with her publication of Wojciech K\u0142os. Historia po\u017cytecznego cz\u0142owieka (Wojciech K\u0142os: The Story of a Useful Man). At the same time as the latter publication, Dawid took over as editor-in-chief of Glos and Dawidowa was put in charge of organizational and marketing administration for the magazine. In 1905, when the Polish Revolution failed, her husband was ordered to leave Poland and fled to Vienna, Dawidowa took over as editor of G\u0142os from March through June and sent money to Dawid for his financial support, as his health was in decline. In June, authorities suspended the journal's operations.\n\nThough some 5,000 students had graduated from Flying University, in 1906, Dawidowa withdrew from the board, when it was allowed to legalize its operations as the Towarzystwa Kurs\u00f3w Naukowych (Association of Scientific Courses). She and her husband began working as editors of Przegl\u0105d Spo\u0142eczny (Social Review) that same year and then in 1907, switched to the journal Spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo (Society), where Dawidowa continued to write about social issues and education. Through 1910, she published over 30 articles and manuscripts in journals for which she worked as editor and others, like Przegl\u0105dzie Tygodniowym \u017bycia Spo\u0142ecznego (Weekly Review of Social Life), Literatury i Sztuk Pi\u0119knych (Literature and Fine Arts), and Przegl\u0105dzie Pedagogicznym (Pedagogical Review).\n\nDeath and legacy\nSuffering from depression and exhaustion, in 1910, Dawidowa was urged by friends to take time away at the village of Rokosz near G\u00f3ra Kalwaria. There on 26 February 1910, she committed suicide by throwing herself down a concrete well. After the funeral service, which was held in the cathedral in which the couple were married, she was buried in Pow\u0105zki Cemetery. Her husband, who was anguished by her death, moved to Krak\u00f3w in 1912 and prematurely died four years after she did. \n\nDawidowa is recognized as a pioneer of women's education and empowerment in Poland. The letters exchanged by the couple during their lifetimes were deposited in 1915 at the Department of Old Prints and Manuscripts at the Warsaw Public Library, after Dawid's death. The library hosted an exhibition, Schodz\u0105ca w otch\u0142a\u0144 (Descending into the Abyss), in honor of Szczawi\u0144ska-Dawidowa's work to establish the first public library in Warsaw, on her 150th birthday in 2014.

After completing her secondary schooling in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and then Warsaw, she graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1925 with a degree in foreign trade. With the onset of World War II, she moved to Krak\u00f3w, where she was active in underground education and acitivism. In 1945, after WW2 ended, Szczawi\u0144ska-Dawidowa founded and became the Chief of the Women's Educational Section of the Central Institute for Labor Education.

He was a Knight of the Military Order of Calatrava.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Madrid, he came from an aristocratic Galician family, whose homestead was near Santiago de Compostela. His father was Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Caama\u00f1o, and his mother, Mariana Moraleja Alocen. He entered the Spanish Navy (Armada) at the age of 18, and two years later he was an Ensign (Alf\u00e9rez de Navio).\n\nExplorations\nA few years later he formed part of a politico-commercial expedition to Constantinople to establish business relations with Turkey, Poland, and Russia. After a quick trip to Cuba in 1787, he was chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra to go to the Pacific Coast of Mexico and the naval base of San Blas, the headquarters for the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. He was a Frigate Lieutenant (Teniente de Fragata) at the time. Alongside went his brother-in-law, Francisco de Eliza, who would distinguish himself as Governor of Fort San Miguel on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound. On their ship to Mexico was the recently named Viceroy of New Spain, Don Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. On February 3, 1790, Caama\u00f1o took part on an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He was commanding the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario (also known as the La Princesa), a 189-ton frigate built in San Blas for the exploration of the North. He did not go beyond Nootka on this voyage, but on his next one, in 1792, came as far as Bucareli Bay commanding the frigate Ar\u00e1nzazu, a corvette built at Cavite in the Philippines. By this time he had been promoted to Ship Lieutenant (Teniente de Nav\u00edo). This expedition did a thorough study of the coast from Bucareli to Nootka, marking the map of Alaska and British Columbia with many names which are there today. Sailing from Nootka on June 13, 1792, Caama\u00f1o explored Bucareli Bay, off Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, and anchored in Dixon Entrance on July 20. Then he explored southward, passing through Principe Channel, Nepean Sound, Whale Sound, near the Estevan Group archipelago, then into Caama\u00f1o Sound and south through Laredo Channel, between Aristazabal Island and Princess Royal Island, returning to Nootka on September 7, 1792. He named Principe Channel, Laredo Channel, Campania Island, Campania Sound, Aristazabal Island, Gil Island and Gravina Island after Federico Gravina). George Vancouver adopted these names for his chart.\n\nLater career and family\nHaving successfully completed his trip to Alaska, Caama\u00f1o was sent, after a brief stay in San Blas, across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. From 1794 to 1807 he served at various posts between Mexico and Peru, having married on one of those trips the Ecuadorian, Francisca de Arteta Santistevan, who gave him eight children. In 1820 he was still living in Guayaquil, the birthplace of his youngest daughter, but nothing is known of the date and place of his death. Some of his descendants, the Caama\u00f1o family, have been historically prominent in Ecuador, most notably his grandson, Jos\u00e9 Pl\u00e1cido Caama\u00f1o, who became president of the Republic. Also noted is his great-grandson, Jacinto Jij\u00f3n y Caama\u00f1o, a noted aristocrat, historian and politician; as well as another great-grandson, the poet Ernesto Noboa y Caama\u00f1o, among others.\n\nLegacy\nCamano Island, an island in Puget Sound, was named to honor Jacinto Caama\u00f1o, as was Caama\u00f1o Sound, British Columbia, on the northern limit of which there is also Jacinto Island.  Other Spanish names in the immediate vicinity of Caama\u00f1o Sound are Campania Sound, Estevan Point (named by Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez) and Aristazabal Island.  Also named for him is Caama\u00f1o Passage northwest of Prince Rupert (between Dundas and Zayas Islands).\n\nSee also\nList of ships in British Columbia\n\nReferences\nWagner, Henry R., \"The Journal of Jacinto Caama\u00f1o\" in the British Columbia Historical Quarterly. 2(3), 189-222 & 2(4), 265-300.\nWagner, Henry R., Northwest Coast, pp.\u00a0233\u2013235.\nHayes, Derek, Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest, p.\u00a076.\nHowgego, Raymond, Encyclopedia of Exploration I, C1, p.\u00a0167.\nKathleen E Dalzell, The Queen Charlotte Islands Vol. 2: Of Places and Names (Queen Charlotte Islands)\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n \n\n1759 births\n1820s deaths\nPeople from Madrid\nSpanish explorers of North America\nExplorers of British Columbia\nSpanish explorers\nSpanish history in the Pacific Northwest\n18th-century explorers\n18th-century Spanish people\n19th-century Spanish people\nExplorers of Alaska", "machine_text": " Jacinto Caama\u00f1o (July 17, 1934 \u2013 December 27, 1971) was a Dominican politician. He took part in the April 24, 1965 uprising against the regime of dictator Rafael Trujillo, considered a turning point for the Dominican Republic, and is considered one of the key figures of the Dominican Restoration War. Caama\u00f1o was born in the town of Esperanza in the Monse\u00f1or Nouel province on July 17, 1934 to parents who were prominent members of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. He studied law at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD), and emerged as a leader during university demonstrations against Trujillo's regime. In 1965, he and a group of students formed the Revolutionary Movement of Dominican Students (MEREDES), which organized protests and demonstrations against the regime. On April 24, 1965, Caama\u00f1o, along with other MEREDES members, led an uprising against Trujillo that quickly gained support from students and members of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. After armed clashes with Trujillo's forces, their efforts helped to end the regime. In October 1965, Caama\u00f1o participated in the historic elections that brought Joaquin Balaguer to power. He was later appointed Minister of Agriculture and was part of the Dominican Revolutionary Party organization that fought against Balaguer's dictatorship. In 1971, Caama\u00f1o became the Dominican Revolutionary Party's presidential candidate. He conducted a campaign emphasizing social justice that included speeches in several towns around the country. The following year, on December 27, he was assassinated during a rally in the town of La Vega. Following his death, the People's Revolutionary Party and different civic organizations in the DR declared a three days mourning. Caama\u00f1o is considered a national hero by Dominicans due to his role in achieving democracy and fighting for social justice. His face is also included in one of the 25 Dominican Coins. Every year, different events are organized around the country in commemoration of his death.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8492970}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Automatic weather station\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An automatic weather station (AWS) is an automated version of the traditional weather station, either to save human labour or to enable measurements from remote areas. An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the data logger, rechargeable battery, telemetry (optional) and the meteorological sensors with an attached solar panel or wind turbine and mounted upon a mast. The specific configuration may vary due to the purpose of the system. The system may report in near real time via the Argos System and the Global Telecommunications System, or save the data for later recovery. \n\nIn the past, automatic weather stations were often placed where electricity and communication lines were available. Nowadays, the solar panel, wind turbine and mobile phone technology have made it possible to have wireless stations that are not connected to the electrical grid or hardline telecommunications network.\n\nSensors\n\nMost automatic weather stations have\n Thermometer for measuring temperature\n Anemometer for measuring wind speed\n Wind vane for measuring wind direction\n Hygrometer for measuring humidity\n Barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure\n\nSome stations can also have\n Ceilometer for measuring cloud height\n Present weather sensor and/or visibility sensor \n Rain gauge for measuring liquid-equivalent precipitation\n Ultrasonic snow depth sensor for measuring depth of snow\n Pyranometer for measuring solar radiation\n\nUnlike manual weather stations, automated airport weather stations cannot report the class and amount of clouds. Also, precipitation measurements are difficult, especially for snow, as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as fog patches, remain unobserved. The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record. The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location can lead to a jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by homogenization.\n\nData-logger\n\nThe data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station.\nIn high quality weather stations, the data-logger may be designed by the supplier to be the perfect solution for a particular meteorological client.\nIndeed, usually data-loggers found in the market don't fit the requirement in terms of power consumption, inputs, communication, protection against animals (ants, rats, etc.),  humidity, salty air, sand, etc.\nThe main functions of a data-logger are:\n Measurement: the data-logger collects the information from every sensor and archives it.\n Calculation: the data-logger processes most of the meteorological data for the users (avg, min, max...).\n Data storage: the data-logger saves all the data either on its own memory or on uSD memory card.\n Power supply: the data-logger manages the power supply of the Automatic Weather Station, using a solar panel for instance.\n Communication: the data-logger manages the communication protocols with the remote server. The different communication protocols are usually GSM, GPRS, RTC, WiFi, uSD, and RS232.\n\nEnclosures\n\nEnclosures used with automatic weather stations are typically weather proof fiberglass, ABS or stainless steel, With ABS being the cheapest, cast aluminium paint or stainless steel the most durable and fiberglass being a compromise.\n\nPower supply\nThe main power source for an automatic weather station depends on its usage.  Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels connected in parallel with a regulator and one or more rechargeable batteries. As a rule of thumb, solar output is at its optimum for only 5 hours each day. As such, mounting angle and position are vital. In the Northern Hemisphere, the solar panel would be mounted facing south and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere. The output from the solar panels may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid.  Most automated airport weather stations are connected to the commercial power grid due to the higher power needs of the ceilometer and present weather sensors, which are active sensors and emit energy directly into the environment.\n\nMast\n\nThe standard mast heights used with automatic weather stations are 2, 3, 10 and 30 meters. Other sizes are available, but typically these sizes have been used as standards for differing applications.\nThe 2 meter (6.6 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect a human subject. The mast height is referenced to head height.\nThe 3 meter (9.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect crops (such as wheat, sugar cane etc.) The mast height is referenced to crop top.\nThe 10 meter (32.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters without interference from objects such as trees, buildings or other obstructions. Typically the most important weather parameter measured at this height is wind speed and direction.\nThe 30 meter (98.4 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters over stratified distances for the purposes of data modelling. A common application is to take measurements of wind, humidity and temperature at 30, 10, and 2 meters. Other sensors are mounted around the 2 meter or lower height.\n\nSee also\n Personal weather station\n Mesonet\n Cooperative Observer\n\nReferences\n\nMeteorological instrumentation and equipment", "machine_text": " An automatic weather station (AWS) is a device that collects and stores weather data such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. It is an automated version of the traditional weather station used by meteorologists, which can measure the immediate climate using a variety of sensor collections, often making recording the environment easier and more efficient. The data collected by an AWS is usually transmitted to a central monitoring center to be analyzed and used for generating weather forecasts, alerts, and other forms of value-added products. AWS are typically composed of several modules. The most basic contains only temperature and weather instruments. A more sophisticated station may have a weather transceiver, anemometer, wind vane, barometer, thermometer, and other instruments mounted together on a tripod or stand. This type of configuration allows for a more complex range of weather data collection. AWSs are typically found at airports, harbours, research stations, military bases, and other areas that require accurate and reliable weather readings. A number of devices are required for a weather station to be considered an autoweather station, including a thermometer, anemometer, pressure sensor, and a rain gauge. While some models include wireless transmission, others prioritize data accuracy, and still others offer cloud-based services. In addition to measuring the meteorological parameters, some AWStations are modified to also measure other anomalies such as water vapor, soil salinity, water levels, soil temperature, and trace levels of contaminants. Some stations are fitted with cameras that transmit live images and enable remote users to monitor their environment. AWSs are used by researchers, meteorologists, climatologists, civil engineers, and aviation personnel to generate climate change models and forecasts. This is done by providing detailed recordings of the weather variables over a period of time. The accuracy of AWS weather data is very precise compared to manually measured data due to advanced data capturing capabilities and accuracy sensors. The data collected by AWS is beneficial to many industries due to its accuracy and detail. AWStatins are used in a variety of research applications such as agriculture, renewable energy, climate change, storm prediction, natural disasters, military operations, engineering projects, and pollution levels. The data collected is used to assess the effects of climate change, predict storms, and forecast weather patterns up to two weeks in advance. In the modern era, the use of AWStatins is becoming increasingly popular due to their cost effectiveness, accuracy, ease of use, and reliability. This technology has allowed for advancements in many different areas of our lives. Future advancements in autonomous AWStatins will support more reliable and accurate climate monitoring, with the ability to respond quickly to changing weather conditions.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1911275}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Breit equation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Breit equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Gregory Breit in 1929 based on the Dirac equation, which formally describes two or more massive spin-1/2 particles (electrons, for example) interacting electromagnetically to the first order in perturbation theory. It accounts for magnetic interactions and retardation effects to the order of 1/c2. When other quantum electrodynamic effects are negligible, this equation has been shown to give results in good agreement with experiment.  It was originally derived from the Darwin Lagrangian but later vindicated by the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory and eventually quantum electrodynamics.\n\nIntroduction \nThe Breit equation is not only an approximation in terms of quantum mechanics, but also in terms of relativity theory as it is not completely invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Just as does the Dirac equation, it treats nuclei as point sources of an external field for the particles it describes. For N particles, the Breit equation has the form (rij is the distance between particle i and j):\n\nwhere \nis the Dirac Hamiltonian (see Dirac equation) for particle i at position ri and \u03c6(ri) is the scalar potential at that position; qi is the charge of the particle, thus for electrons qi = \u2212e.\nThe one-electron Dirac Hamiltonians of the particles, along with their instantaneous Coulomb interactions 1/rij, form the Dirac-Coulomb operator. To this, Breit added the operator (now known as the (frequency-independent) Breit operator):\n\nwhere the Dirac matrices for electron i: a(i) = [\u03b1x(i), \u03b1y(i), \u03b1z(i)]. The two terms in the Breit operator account for retardation effects to the first order.\nThe wave function \u03a8 in the Breit equation is a spinor with 4N elements, since each electron is described by a Dirac bispinor with 4 elements as in the Dirac equation, and the total wave function is the tensor product of these.\n\nBreit Hamiltonians \nThe total Hamiltonian of the Breit equation, sometimes called the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian (HDCB) can be decomposed into the following practical energy operators for electrons in electric and magnetic fields (also called the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian), which have well-defined meanings in the interaction of molecules with magnetic fields (for instance for nuclear magnetic resonance):\n\nin which the consecutive partial operators are:\n  is the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian ( is the stationary mass of particle i).\n  is connected to the dependence of mass on velocity: .\n  is a correction that partly accounts for retardation and can be described as the interaction between the magnetic dipole moments of the particles, which arise from the orbital motion of charges (also called orbit\u2013orbit interaction).\n  is the classical interaction between the orbital magnetic moments (from the orbital motion of charge) and spin magnetic moments (also called spin\u2013orbit interaction).

It is used to describe the interaction of two particles in a three-dimensional system. The Breit equation is derived from one of the most popular theories of scattering theory, the scattering amplitude theory. The Breit equation is an extension of the exchange of virtual photons between two particles, and is the basis for the exchange of mesons in particle physics. The Breit equation is written as a function of the energy-momentum product (also known as the Mandelstam invariant or \"s-product\"). It is expressed as: F(s,e)=G(s,e)+H(s,e) where G and H are functions of s and e. G is the Gamow factor and H is the exchange-forcing term. The Breit equation can be solved analytically for different values of s and e. The Breit equation was originally developed for the purpose of calculating scattering amplitudes for nuclear and particle physics. But it has recently been used in other fields including optically active crystals, plasmon and polaritons, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. The Breit equation is an important tool in particle physics because it can calculate scattering amplitudes for various processes. This allows researchers to investigate the behavior of particles in different circumstances and to better understand the nature of Nature. The Breit equation is also used in quantum field theory to investigate gravitational interactions and quantum electrodynamics. It is also used to study neutrino oscillations and for calculations of the Bragg peak structure for radiation therapy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Huo Qubing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Huo Qubing (140 BC \u2013 117 BC) was a Chinese military general and politician of the Western Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. He was the nephew of the general Wei Qing and Empress Wei Zifu (Emperor Wu's wife), and the half-brother of the statesman Huo Guang. Along with Wei Qing, he led a campaign into the Gobi Desert of what is now Mongolia to defeat the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, winning decisive victories such as the Battle of Mobei in 119 BC.\n\nEarly life\nHuo Qubing was an illegitimate son from the love affair between Wei Shaoer (), the daughter of a lowly maid from the household of Princess Pingyang (Emperor Wu's older sister), and Huo Zhongru (), a low-ranking civil servant employed there at the time.  However, Huo Zhongru did not want to marry a lower class serf girl like Wei Shaoer, so he abandoned her and went away to marry a woman from his home town instead.  Wei Shaoer insisted on keeping the child, raising him with help of her siblings.\n\nWhen Huo Qubing was around two years old, his younger aunt Wei Zifu, who was serving as an in-house singer/dancer for Princess Pingyang, caught the attention of the young Emperor Wu, who took her and her half-brother Wei Qing back to his palace in the capital, Chang'an.  More than a year later, the newly favoured concubine Wei Zifu became pregnant with Emperor Wu's first child, earning her the jealousy and hatred of Emperor Wu's then empress consort, Empress Chen.  Empress Chen's mother, Grand Princess Guantao (), then attempted to retaliate against Wei Zifu by kidnapping and attempting to murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman at the Jianzhang Camp (\u5efa\u7ae0\u71df, Emperor Wu's royal guards).  After Wei Qing was rescued by fellow palace guards led by his close friend Gongsun Ao (), Emperor Wu took the opportunity to humiliate Empress Chen and Princess Guantao by promoting Wei Zifu to a consort (\u592b\u4eba, a concubine position lower only to the Empress) and Wei Qing to the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (), Chief of Staff (), and Chief Councillor (), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants.  The rest of the Wei family were also well rewarded, including the decreed marriage of Wei Shaoer's older sister Wei Junru () to Emperor Wu's adviser, Gongsun He ().  At the time, Wei Shaoer was romantically engaged with Chen Zhang (), a great-grandson of Emperor Gaozu's adviser Chen Ping.  Their relationship was also legitimized by Emperor Wu through the form of decreed marriage. Through the rise of the Wei family, the young Huo Qubing grew up in prosperity and prestige.\n\nMilitary career\nHuo Qubing exhibited outstanding military talent even as a teenager.  Emperor Wu saw Huo's potential and made Huo his personal assistant.\n\nIn 123 BC, Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing from Dingxiang () to engage the invading Xiongnu, and appointed the 18-year-old Huo Qubing to serve as the Captain of Piaoyao () under his uncle, seeing real combat for the first time.  Although Wei Qing was able to kill or capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian (\u8607\u5efa, father of the Han diplomat and statesman, Su Wu) and Zhao Xin (\u8d99\u4fe1, a surrendered Xiongnu prince) was outnumbered and annihilated after encountering the Xiongnu force led by Yizhixie Chanyu ().  Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting.  Due to the loss of this detachment, Wei Qing's troops did not earn any promotion, but Huo Qubing distinguished himself by leading a long-distance search-and-destroy mission with 800 light cavalrymen, killing the Chanyu's grandfather and over 2,000 enemy troops, as well as capturing numerous Xiongnu nobles.  A very impressed Emperor Wu then made Huo Qubing the Marquess of Champion () with a march of 2,500 households.\n\nIn 121 BC, Emperor Wu deployed Huo Qubing twice in that year against the Xiongnu in the Hexi Corridor.  During spring, Huo Qubing led 10,000 cavalry, fought through five Western Regions kingdoms within 6 days, advanced over 1,000 li over Mount Yanzhi (), killed two Xiongnu princes along with nearly 9,000 enemy troops, and captured several Xiongnu nobles as well as the golden statue used by Xiongnu as an artifact for holy rituals. For this achievement, his march was increased by 2,200 households. During the summer of the same year, Xiongnu attacked the Dai Commandery and Yanmen.  Huo Qubing set off from Longxi (modern-day Gansu) with over 10,000 cavalry, supported by Gongsun Ao, who set off from the Beidi Commandery (\u5317\u5730\u90e1, modern-day Huan County, Gansu).  Despite Gongsun Ao failing to keep up, Huo Qubing travelled over 2,000 li without backup, all the way past Juyan Lake to Qilian Mountains, killing over 30,000 Xiongnu soldiers and capturing a dozen Xiongnu princes.  His march was then increased further by a 5,400 households for the victory.\n\nHuo Qubing's victories dealt heavy blows to the tribes of the Xiongnu princes of Hunxie () and Xiutu () that occupied the Hexi Corridor.  Out of frustration, Yizhixie Chanyu wanted to mercilessly execute those two princes as punishment. The Prince of Hunxie contacted the Han government in autumn of 121 BC to negotiate a surrender. Failing to persuade his fellow prince to do the same, he killed the Prince of Xiutu and ordered Xiutu's forces to also surrender.  When the two tribes went to meet the Han forces, Xiutu's forces rioted.  Seeing the situation changed, Huo Qubing alone headed to the Xiongnu camp. There, the general ordered the Prince of Hunxie to calm his men and stand down before putting down 8,000 Xiongnu men who refused to disarm, effectively quelling the riot.  The Hunxie tribe was then resettled into the Central Plain.  The surrender of the Xiutu and Hunxie tribes stripped Xiongnu of any control over the Western Regions, depriving them of a large grazing area.  As a result, Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct trade access to Central Asia.  This also provided a new supply of high-quality horse breeds from Central Asia, including the famed Ferghana horse (ancestors of the modern Akhal-Teke), further strengthening the Han army.  Emperor Wu then reinforced this strategic asset by establishing five commanderies and constructing a length of fortified wall along the border of the Hexi Corridor. He colonised the area with 700,000 Chinese soldier-settlers.\n\nAfter the series of defeats by Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Yizhixie Chanyu took Zhao Xin's advice and retreated with his tribes to the north of the Gobi Desert, hoping that the barren land would serve as a natural barrier against Han offensives.  Emperor Wu however, was far from giving up, and planned a massive expeditionary campaign in 119 BC.  Han forces were deployed in two separate columns, each consisting of 50,000 cavalry and over 100,000 infantry, with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing serving as the supreme commander for each.\n\nEmperor Wu, who had been distancing Wei Qing and giving the younger Huo Qubing more attention and favour, hoped that Huo would engage the stronger Chanyu's tribe and preferentially assigned him the most elite troopers.  The initial plan called for Huo Qubing to attack from Dingxiang (\u5b9a\u8944, modern-day Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia) and engage the Chanyu, with Wei Qing supporting him in the east from Dai Commandery (\u4ee3\u90e1, modern-day, Yu County, Hebei) to engage the Left Worthy Prince ().  However, a Xiongnu prisoner of war confessed that the Chanyu's main force was at the east side.  Unaware that this was actually false information provided by the Xiongnu, Emperor Wu ordered the two columns to switch routes, with Wei Qing now setting off on the western side from Dingxiang, and Huo Qubing marching on the eastern side from the Dai Commandery.\n\nBattles at the eastern Dai Commandery theatre were quite straightforward, as Huo Qubing's forces were far superior to their enemies.  Huo Qubing advanced over 2,000 li and directly engaged the Left Worthy Prince in a swift and decisive battle.  He quickly encircled and overran the Xiongnu, killing over 70,000 men, and capturing three lords and 83 nobles, while suffering a 20% casualty rate that was quickly resupplied from local captives.  He then went on to conduct a series of rituals upon his arrival at the Khentii Mountains (\u72fc\u5c45\u80e5\u5c71, and the more northern \u59d1\u884d\u5c71) to symbolize the historic Han victory, then continued his pursuit as far as Lake Baikal (), effectively annihilating the Xiongnu clan and allowing conquering tribe such as the Donghu People to retake back their land to establish their own confederacy to declared independent from Xiongnu Overlord following the subjugation for over a few decade.  A separate division led by Lu Bode (), set off on a strategically flanking route from Right Beiping (\u53f3\u5317\u5e73, modern-day Ningcheng County, Inner Mongolia), joined forces with Huo Qubing after arriving in time with 2,800 enemy kills, and the combined forces then returned in triumph.  This victory earned Huo Qubing 5,800 households of fiefdom as a reward, making him more distinguished than his uncle Wei Qing. At the height of his career, many low-ranking commanders previously served under Wei Qing voluntarily transferred to Huo Qubing's service in the hope of achieving military glory with him.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nEmperor Wu offered to help Huo Qubing build up a household for marriage. Huo Qubing, however, answered that \"the Xiongnu are not yet eliminated, why should I start a family?\" (\u5308\u5974\u672a\u6ec5\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5bb6\u70ba\uff1f), a statement that became an inspirational Chinese patriotic motto.  Though Huo Qubing was recorded as a quietly spoken man of few words, he was far from humble. Sima Qian noted in Shiji that Huo Qubing paid little regard to his men, refusing to share his food with his soldiers, and regularly ordering his troops to conduct cuju games despite them being short on rations. When Emperor Wu suggested him to study The Art of War by Sun Tzu and Wuzi by Wu Qi, Huo Qubing claimed that he naturally understood war strategies and had no need to study. When his subordinate Li Gan (\u674e\u6562, son of Li Guang) assaulted Wei Qing, the latter forgave the incident. Huo Qubing, on the other hand, refused to tolerate such disrespect towards his uncle and personally shot Li Gan during a hunting trip. Emperor Wu covered for Qubing, stating that Li Gan was \"killed by a deer\".\n\nWhen it came to military glory, Huo Qubing was said to be more generous.  One story about him told of when Emperor Wu awarded Huo a jar of precious wine for his achievement, he poured it into a creek so all his men drinking the water could share a taste of it, giving the name to the city of Jiuquan (\u9152\u6cc9, literally \"wine spring\").\n\nHuo Qubing died in 117 BC at the early age of 23. After Huo Qubing's death, the aggrieved Emperor Wu ordered the elite troops from the five border commanderies to line up all the way from Chang'an to Maoling, where Huo Qubing's tomb was constructed in the shape of the Qilian Mountains to commemorate his military achievements. Huo Qubing was then posthumously appointed the title Marquess of Jinghuan (), and a large \"Horse Stomping Xiongnu\" () stone statue was built in front of his tomb, near Emperor Wu's tomb of Maoling.\n\nHuo Qubing was among the most decorated military commanders in Chinese history.  The Eastern Han Dynasty historian Ban Gu, summarized in his Book of Han Huo Qubing's achievements with a poem:\nThe Champion of Piaoji, fast and brave.Six long-distance assaults, like lightning and thunder.Watering horse at Lake Baikal, conducting rituals at Khentii Mountains.Conquering the area west of great river, establishing commanderies along Qilian Mountains.\n\u7968\u9a0e\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u730b\u52c7\u7d1b\u7d1c\uff0c\u9577\u9a45\u516d\u64e7\uff0c\u96fb\u64ca\u96f7\u9707\uff0c\u98f2\u99ac\u7ff0\u6d77\uff0c\u5c01\u72fc\u5c45\u5c71\uff0c\u897f\u898f\u5927\u6cb3\uff0c\u5217\u90e1\u7941\u9023\u3002\n\nHuo Qubing's half-brother, Huo Guang, whom he took custody away from his father, was later a great statesman who was the chief counsel for Emperor Zhao, and was instrumental in the succession of Emperor Xuan to the throne after Emperor Zhao's death.\n\nHuo Qubing's son, Huo Sh\u00e0n (), succeeded him as the Marquess of Jinghuan but died young in 110 BC.  So Huo Qubing's title became extinct.  His grandson Huo Sh\u0101n (\u970d\u5c71, later Marquess of Leping) and Huo Yun (\u970d\u4e91, later Marquess of Guanyang) were involved in a failed plot to overthrow Emperor Xuan of Han in 66 BC, resulting in both of them committing suicide and the Huo clan being executed. It was presumably that no male descendant of Huo Qubing nor Huo Guang survived, as during the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, it was Huo Yang, a great-grandson of Huo Qubing's paternal cousin, who was chosen as the descendant of Huo Guang to be the Marquess of Bolu.\n\nPopular culture \nHuo Qubing is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei.\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Li Junfeng () in the popular 2005 historical epics TV series The Emperor in Han Dynasty ().\n\nHuo Qubing was played by Eddie Peng () under the name of Wei Wuji  () in the popular romance Chinese drama Sound of the Desert () derived from the book Da Mo Yao/Ballad of the Desert () by famous novel writer Tong Hua.\n\nHuo Qubing is also mentioned in the blockbuster film Dragon Blade, where the main character, played by Jackie Chan, is said to have been raised up by him. Actor Feng Shaofeng portrays the general in brief flashbacks.\n\nSee also \n Emperor Wu of Han\n Han\u2013Xiongnu War\n Jin Midi\n Ban Chao\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Joseph P Yap Wars with the Xiongnu \u2013 A translation From Zizhi tongjian AuthorHouse (2009) \n\n140 BC births\n117 BC deaths\nHan dynasty generals from Shaanxi\nHan dynasty politicians from Shaanxi\nPoliticians from Xi'an", "machine_text": " Huo Qubing (140 BC \u2013 117 BC) was a Chinese general during the Han Dynasty of China, hailed save the country and was ranked as one of the best generals in ancient Chinese history. He was the nephew of the Han Dynasty's founding emperor, and is known for leading a successful campaign against the Xiongnu and becoming one of the most successful generals in Chinese history. Huo Qubing was born the second son of Huo Guang, and was the nephew of the Han Dynasty's first emperor, Liu Bang. He served as a cavalry commander in the Han army and distinguished himself at an early age for his bravery and battle prowess. He often served as a strategist for the young Emperor Han Wu Di, who inherited the throne from his father, Liu Bang. In the sixth year of Emperor Wu's reign, Huo Qubing led 6000 cavalry in a surprise attack on the Xiongnu people in the Gobi Desert. He fought valiantly and defeated the Xiongnu in several battles, winning many victories. This campaign was by far the most successful campaign against the Xiongnu in Chinese history, and demonstrated the superior tactics employed by the Han Dynasty forces. The battle became known as the Battle of Teguk Fire, and earned Huo Qubing a reputation as one of the greatest military minds of the time. Huo Qubing died of illness in 117 BC at the age of 23, four years after leading the successful campaign against the Xiongnu. In his 23 years of life, Qubing had acquired immense prestige and had achieved many accomplishments. Emperor Wu Di was so devastated by his death that he had him buried in an area lined with pear trees, and gave him a posthumous title of Marquis Wenxin. Today, Huo Qubing is still celebrated in China as one of its greatest generals. His success in leading a decisive attack against the Xiongnu enabled the Han Empire to expand in Inner Asia and provided China with a safe border place. His tactics and decision making in battle were so impressive that they have been studied by military strategists both in modern day China and beyond.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1903774}

The population was 8,126 at the 2010 census.  The township consists of five non-contiguous sections bordered mostly by the cities of East Lansing and\u00a0Lansing.  The township also contains the community of Edgemont Park.\n\nHistory\nThe first white pioneer to purchase land in the township was Jacob F. Cooley in 1837. The township was organized in 1842 in the northwest corner of Ingham County and was named after the hometown of one of the township's original settlers. The township experienced its first loss of land in 1859 when the unincorporated settlement of Lansing officially incorporated as a city out of seven square miles near the center of the township.\n\nDescription\nThe cities of Lansing and East Lansing have incorporated much of the land that formerly constituted the township reducing the township from its original  to its current  in five disconnected land areas.\n\nThe western section of the township is the largest, and it includes almost all of the township's industrial developments including the large General Motors Lansing Craft Center and General Motors Lansing Metal Center automobile factories, both of which were closed and shuttered in early 2006. A Superfund site, Adams Plating, is located in this part of the township. Also in the western part are the former Waverly Golf Course and the adjacent Michigan Avenue Park. Formerly owned and operated by the city of Lansing, Michigan Avenue Park included a sledding hill and Little League Baseball field.  At the north end of this section of the township north of Saginaw Highway (M-43) lies the residential neighborhood and CDP (census-designated place) of Edgemont Park.\n\nThe northeastern section of the township is heavily industrialized on its western end (west of Wood Road), but since 2002 this section has become the 'downtown' of Lansing Township with the construction of the Eastwood Towne Center, one of the largest shopping malls in Metropolitan Lansing, and the subsequent creation of the Lansing Township Downtown Development Authority to capture state and national funds for development.\n\nThe central eastern sections of the township are almost exclusively residential, save for a small strip of land that runs along either side of US-127. The northern portion of these two sections contain the large Groesbeck neighborhood, and the smaller southern portion includes part of the Urbandale neighborhood.\n\nThe southeastern section of the township is exclusively agricultural in nature, containing experimental farms for Michigan State University.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which  is land and  (2.52%) is water.\n\nDemographics\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,126 people, 3,929 households, and 1,897 families residing in the township. The population density was 1,658.3 per square mile (634.8/km2). There were 4,319 housing units at an average density of 881.4 per square mile (337.4/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 76.3% White, 12.5% African American, 0.5% Native American, 2.6% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 3.5% from other races, and 4.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.9% of the population.\n\n2000 census\nThere were 4,104 households, out of which 22.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.3% were married couples living together, 12.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.1% were non-families. 40.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

It was founded as a Class D league and by 1933 it had elevated to the highest status of Class A1. The League operated for 15 seasons and came about for two main reasons. The first was an effort by the league's President T. V. Bartley to draw larger crowds and more investors by building rivalries between teams from neighboring New York and Pennsylvania. The second was the population growth and industrial development of the towns and cities that were part of the league\u2014making baseball and the team's themselves more popular. The New York and Pennsylvania teams in the league would go head-to-head and on the field, there were few biases towards either side. For instance, in the 1933 season, teams hailing from New York and Pennsylvania were equally represented in the playoffs (3 vs. 3). The format of the league allowed for two teams \u2014 one from New York and one from Pennsylvania \u2014 to meet in the playoffs a total of three times over the course of the 15-season run. The league, being a minor league, had teams that were generally well-off and that could offer good playing conditions. It also had some of the best working-class ballplayers in minor league history, players such as Stan Datz, Babe Williams, Pedro D\u00edaz, and Benny Keal. The most successful team in the league was the Elmira Colonels, and the team's success continued through the Great Depression. By 1932 and 1933, the Colonels had won consecutive Championship titles and the team was widely regarded as one of the best teams in the NYP League. As the economy slowly recovered, other teams in the League were able to reach the same level as the Colonels and by 1937, a number of teams had become competitive, achieving success on the field and drawing large audiences. In 1937, however, the League disbanded due to a lack of financial stability and growing competition from other athletic leagues. Although the NYP League was successful while it lasted, its legacy is preserved in only a handful of baseball books and newsreels.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5683587}

From 1898 until the district's closure in 1917, Piazza worked as a madam and specialized in providing octoroon women for her clients; she herself was mixed-race.\n\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Piazza's early life. Her parents, Italian immigrant Vincent Piazza and woman of colour, Celia Caldwell, were both still teenagers and unmarried at the time of her birth. Their daughter had at least two other siblings. Piazza was born in Copiah County, Mississippi and first moved to New Orleans in the mid-1890s.\n\n\"Countess\" Willie Piazza\nOperating for a period of about twenty years, Piazza became known in Storyville for her brothel parlor. She was one of several women of mixed ancestry to operate brothels in the area, Lulu White being perhaps the most prominent. Purchasing her 317 N. Basin Street premises for $12,000 in 1907, she spent an additional $30,000 on furnishings and other upgrades; the brothel was immediately successful, allowing Piazza to pay off the mortgage within two years. Piazza's \"girls\" were known around New Orleans for their fine clothes, private coaches, and for their abilities to sing and play musical instruments; jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton sometimes played her upright white piano. The average annual income for a Willie Piazza octoroon was thought to be $1,000-$2,000. Piazza herself became known as \"Countess Willie Piazza\" and cultivated an image of European sophistication. She used a \u201ctwo foot ivory, gold and diamond\u201d cigarette holder to smoke Russian cigarettes.\n\nAfter the closure of Storyville in 1917, Piazza continued to work as a prostitute and procuress.\n\nPiazza was one of the main characters (played by Virginia Mayo) in the 1978 Dennis Kane film French Quarter.\n\nDeath\nWillie Piazza died from cancer on November 2, 1932, in New Orleans.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, Piazza began singing and playing instruments at an early age, and let his love for music take him on a path that would eventually lead him to music stardom. It was in the indie and local music scene where Piazza made his mark; performing at numerous venues in the Midwest area and engaging with the music community around him. With an impressive online following, Piazza eventually caught the attention of Atlanta-based record label, BOLD Music, who signed him and immediately began producing his debut EP, \u201cAhead of My Time\u201d. Released in 2019, the EP featured five songs, with Piazza writing, producing, and performing the entirety of the project himself. Ahead of My Time saw much success, attracting over one million streams in its first few weeks, and was lauded for its intricate, heartfelt production and versatile nature. The EP was quickly followed by his debut studio album titled \u201cAuthenticity\u201d the same year, which was also a success, further boosting his growing fame. Since then, Piazza has released six more EP's, as well as three studio albums, and has become an up-and-coming face in the music world. His fresh take on genres, hard-hitting lyrics, and honest sound have gathered a large following across the globe, with his tracks consistently appearing on local music charts and radio stations. Piazza has performed at various music festivals around the United States, and even featured as the opening act for renowned singer, John Legend, in 2021. He has been nominated for several awards, most notably a Grammy in 2020 for his fourth studio album, \u201cLight of the World\u201d. As his career continues to flourish, Piazza shows no signs of slowing down, inspiring both a new generation of musically talented individuals, and established artists alike. #Wikipedia #WilliePiazza", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54150717}

Located on a rocky ridge overlooking a loop of the Ourthe river, its origins go back to a Celtic oppidum.\n\nHistory\nThe castle was built on the ruins of a Celtic oppidum, on a site where human presence dates back to Neolithic times. The Romans later established a fortified camp there. In the early eighth century, Pepin Landen built a villa on the site.\n\nThe first castle was built in 844 (approximately) by Adelard, Count of La Roche. After the death of Henri de la Roche in 1152, the countship passed to Henri the Blind Count of Namur, and upon his death in 1196, to his daughter Ermesinde of Luxembourg and thus to the line of the counts of Luxembourg.\n\nIn the 14th century, the inhabitants of La Roche were authorized by Jean the Blind, count of Luxembourg, to protect their city by a wall and towers that strengthened the defensive system of the castle.\n\nThe strategic importance of the castle did not escape Louis XIV. From 1681 to 1688, he had a student of Vauban reinforce the structures. However, these improvements did not benefit him much since the castle was taken by the winners of the War of Succession of Spain and they neglected it little by little.\n\nThe misfortunes of the castle continued in 1721, when it was badly damaged by a fire caused by lightning. Joseph II of Austria then dismantled it. It was the prey of vandals in the nineteenth century, and it also was damaged in the bombing of December 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nFortunately for history and architecture enthusiasts, the ruins of the castle of La Roche-en-Ardenne still constitute today a beautiful example of military architecture throughout the ages.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Belgium\n\nExternal links \nOfficial website La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle\nLa Roche-en-Ardenne Castle at www.castles.nl\n\nCastles in the Ardennes (Belgium)\nRuined castles in Belgium\nCastles in Belgium\nCastles in Luxembourg (Belgium)\nLa Roche-en-Ardenne Castle\nDuchy of Luxembourg", "machine_text": " La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle is a medieval castle located in the town of La Roche-en-Ardenne, in the Province of Luxembourg, Belgium.

The exact date on which La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle was first built is unknown, though some sources estimate it to the 9th century, during Carolingian Empire rule. At first, it served as an initiative of local counts who depended on the town\u2019s strategic position near the rivers Ourthe and Lomme. In the 11th century, the castle was seized by the count of Luxembourg and later, it passed on to the earls of Bouillon. In the 15th century, the castle was severely damaged during the Burgundian Wars, and during the 16th century, it was rebuilt. However, it was once again destroyed in 1677, when Louis XIV of France sent an army to take over the castle. It was then reconstructed yet again, this time in a more modern appearance, with a tower and two massive bastions. Another restoration was made in the 20th century. Today, the castle remains a beautiful attraction and is open for tours year round. Visitors can explore the castle and visit the old armory and chapel, built in the 13th century.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Automatic bug fixing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Automatic bug-fixing is the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer. It is also commonly referred to as automatic patch generation, automatic bug repair, or automatic program repair. The typical goal of such techniques is to automatically generate correct patches to eliminate bugs in software programs without causing software regression.\n\nSpecification \n\nAutomatic bug fixing is made according to a specification of the expected behavior which can be for instance a formal specification or a test suite.\n\nA test-suite \u2013 the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program, possibly captured in assertions can be used as a test oracle to drive the search. This oracle can in fact be divided between the bug oracle that exposes the faulty behavior, and the regression oracle, which encapsulates the functionality any program repair method must preserve. Note that a test suite is typically incomplete and does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, it is often possible for a validated patch to produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite but incorrect outputs for other inputs. The existence of such validated but incorrect patches is a major challenge for generate-and-validate techniques. Recent successful automatic bug-fixing techniques often rely on additional information other than the test suite, such as information learned from previous human patches, to further identify correct patches among validated patches.\n\nAnother way to specify the expected behavior is to use formal specifications Verification against full specifications that specify the whole program behavior including functionalities is less common because such specifications are typically not available in practice and the computation cost of such verification is prohibitive. For specific classes of errors, however, implicit partial specifications are often available. For example, there are targeted bug-fixing techniques validating that the patched program can no longer trigger overflow errors in the same execution path.\n\nTechniques\n\nGenerate-and-validate \n\nGenerate-and-validate approaches compile and test each candidate patch to collect all validated patches that produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite. Such a technique typically starts with a test suite of the program, i.e., a set of test cases, at least one of which exposes the bug. An early generate-and-validate bug-fixing systems is GenProg. The effectiveness of generate-and-validate techniques remains controversial, because they typically do not provide patch correctness guarantees. Nevertheless, the reported results of recent state-of-the-art techniques are generally promising. For example, on systematically collected 69 real world bugs in eight large C software programs, the state-of-the-art bug-fixing system Prophet generates correct patches for 18 out of the 69 bugs.\n\nOne way to generate candidate patches is to apply mutation operators on the original program. Mutation operators manipulate the original program, potentially via its abstract syntax tree representation, or a more coarse-grained representation such as operating at the statement-level or block-level. Earlier genetic improvement approaches operate at the statement level and carry out simple delete/replace operations such as deleting an existing statement or replacing an existing statement with another statement in the same source file. Recent  approaches use more fine-grained operators at the abstract syntax tree level to generate more diverse set of candidate patches.\n\nAnother way to generate candidate patches consists of using fix templates. Fix templates are typically predefined changes for fixing specific classes of bugs. Examples of fix templates include inserting a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null to fix null pointer exception, or changing an integer constant by one to fix off-by-one errors. It is also possible to automatically mine fix templates for generate-and-validate approaches.\n\nMany generate-and-validate techniques rely on the redundancy insight: the code of the patch can be found elsewhere in the application. This idea was introduced in the Genprog system, where two operators, addition and replacement of AST nodes, were based on code taken from elsewhere (i.e. adding an existing AST node). This idea has been validated empirically, with two independent studies that have shown that a significant proportion of commits (3%-17%) are composed of existing code. Beyond the fact that the code to reuse exists somewhere else, it has also been shown that the context of the potential repair ingredients is useful: often, the donor context is similar to the recipient context.\n\nSynthesis-based \n\nRepair techniques exist that are based on symbolic execution. For example, Semfix uses symbolic execution to extract a repair constraint. Angelix introduced the concept of angelic forest in order to deal with multiline patches.\n\nUnder certain assumptions, it is possible to state the repair problem as a synthesis problem.\nSemFix and Nopol uses component-based synthesis.\nDynamoth  uses dynamic synthesis.\nS3 is based on syntax-guided synthesis.\nSearchRepair converts potential patches into an SMT formula and queries candidate patches that allow the patched program to pass all supplied test cases.\n\nData-driven \n\nMachine learning techniques can improve the effectiveness of automatic bug-fixing systems. One example of such techniques learns from past successful patches from human developers collected from open source repositories in GitHub and SourceForge. It then use the learned information to recognize and prioritize potentially correct patches among all generated candidate patches. Alternatively, patches can be directly mined from existing sources. Example approaches include mining patches from donor applications or from QA web sites. Learning can done online, aka continual learning, with the known precedent of online learning of patches from the stream of open source build results from continuous integration.\n\nSequenceR uses sequence-to-sequence learning on source code in order to generate one-line patches. It defines a neural network architecture that works well with source code, with the copy mechanism that allows to produce patches with tokens that are not in the learned vocabulary. Those tokens are taken from the code of the Java class under repair.\n\nGetafix is a language-agnostic approach developed and used in production at Facebook. Given a sample of code commits where engineers fixed a certain kind of bug, it learns human-like fix patterns that apply to future bugs of the same kind. Besides using Facebook's own code repositories as training data, Getafix learnt some fixes from open source Java repositories. When new bugs get detected, Getafix applies its previously learnt patterns to produce candidate fixes and ranks them within seconds. It presents only the top-ranked fix for final validation by tools or an engineer, in order to save resources and ideally be so fast that no human time was spent on fixing the same bug, yet.\n\nOther \nTargeted automatic bug-fixing techniques generate repairs for specific classes of errors such as null pointer exception integer overflow , buffer overflow , memory leak ,  etc.. Such techniques often use empirical fix templates to fix bugs in the targeted scope. For example, insert a conditional statement to check whether the value of a variable is null or insert missing memory deallocation statements. Comparing to generate-and-validate techniques, targeted techniques tend to have better bug-fixing accuracy but a much narrowed scope.\n\nUse \n\nThere are multiple uses of automatic bug fixing:\n In a development environment: When encountering a bug the developer activates a feature to search for a patch (for instance by clicking on a button). This search can also happen in the background, when the IDE proactively searches for solutions to potential problems, without waiting for explicit action from the developer. \n In a continuous integration server: When a build fails during continuous integration, a patch search can be attempted as soon as the build has failed. If the search is successful, the patch is provided to the developer. When a synthesized patch is suggested to the developers as pull-request, an explanation has to be provided in addition to the code changes (e.g. a pull request title and description). An experiment has shown that generated patches can be accepted by open-source developers and merged in the code repository.\n At runtime: When a failure happens at runtime, a binary patch can be searched for and applied online. An example of such a repair system is ClearView, which does repair on x86 code, with x86 binary patches. The Itzal system is different from Clearview: while the repair search happens at runtime, in production, the produced patches are at the source code level. The BikiniProxy system does online repair of JavaScript errors happening in the browser.\n\nSearch space \n\nIn essence, automatic bug fixing is a search activity, whether deductive-based or heuristic-based. The search space of automatic bug fixing is composed of all edits that can be possibly made to a program. There have been studies to understand the structure of this search space. Qi et al. showed that the original fitness function of Genprog is not better than random search to drive the search. Martinez et al. explored the imbalance between possible repair actions, showing its significant impact on the search. Long et al.'s study indicated that correct patches can be considered as sparse in the search space and that incorrect overfitting patches are vastly more abundant (see also discussion about overfitting below).\n\nIf one explicitly enumerates all possible variants in a repair algorithm, this defines a design space for program repair. Each variant selects an algorithm involved at some point in the repair process (e.g. the fault localization algorithm), or selects a specific heuristic which yields different patches. For instance, in the design space of generate-and-validate program repair, there is one variation point about the granularity of the program elements to be modified: an expression, a statement, a block, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to analyze whether known search spaces encompass existing commits. Such a search space analysis means mining a software repository, this results in an approximation of the applicability and usefulness of a given repair algorithm.\n\nOverfitting \n\nSometimes, in test-suite based program repair, tools generate patches that pass the test suite, yet are actually incorrect, this is known as the \"overfitting\" problem. \"Overfitting\" in this context refers to the fact that the patch overfits to the test inputs. There are different kinds of overfitting: incomplete fixing means that only some buggy inputs are fixed, regression introduction means some previously working features are broken after the patch (because they were poorly tested). Early prototypes for automatic repair suffered a lot from overfitting: on the Manybugs C benchmark, Qi et al. reported that 104/110 of plausible GenProg patches were overfitting; on the Defects4J Java benchmark, Martinez et al. reported that 73/84 plausible patches as overfitting. In the context of synthesis-based repair, Le et al. obtained more than 80% of overfitting patches.\n\nOne way to avoid overfitting is to filter out the generated patches. This can be done based on dynamic analysis, or static code analysis of the generated patches. When a reference patch is available, a state of the art technique is to generate tests based on the patched version, such that the generated tests capture the expected behavior. While the sampling of the input domain by test generation is incomplete by construction, it has been shown to be effective at detecting overfitting patches, and even at finding human errors done during manual classification of patches.\n\nLimitations of automatic bug-fixing \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing techniques that rely on a test suite do not provide patch correctness guarantees, because the test suite is incomplete and does not cover all cases. A weak test suite may cause generate-and-validate techniques to produce validated but incorrect patches that have negative effects such as eliminating desirable functionalities, causing memory leaks, and introducing security vulnerabilities. One possible approach is to amplify the failing test suite by automatically generating further test cases that are then labelled as passing or failing. To minimize the human labelling effort, an automatic test oracle can be trained that gradually learns to automatically classify test cases as passing or failing and only engages the bug-reporting user for uncertain cases.\n\nA limitation of generate-and-validate repair systems is the search space explosion. For a program, there are a large number of statements to change and for each statement there are a large number of possible modifications. State-of-the-art systems address this problem by assuming that a small modification is enough for fixing a bug, resulting in a search space reduction.\n\nThe limitation of approaches based on symbolic analysis is that real world programs are often converted to intractably large formulas especially for modifying statements with side effects.\n\nBenchmarks \n\nBenchmarks of bugs typically focus on one specific programming language.\nIn C, the Manybugs benchmark collected by GenProg authors contains 69 real world defects and it is widely used to evaluate many other bug-fixing tools for C.\n\nIn Java, the main benchmark is Defects4J, initially explored by Martinez et al., and now extensively used in most research papers on program repair for Java. Alternative benchmarks exist, such as the Quixbugs benchmark, which contains original bugs for program repair. Other benchmarks of Java bugs include Bugs.jar, based on past commits, and BEARS which is a benchmark of continuous integration build failures.\n\nExample tools \n\nAutomatic bug-fixing is an active research topic in computer science. There are many implementations of various bug-fixing techniques especially for C and Java programs. Note that most of these implementations are research prototypes for demonstrating their techniques, i.e., it is unclear whether their current implementations are ready for industrial usage or not.\n\nC \n\n ClearView: A generate-and-validate tool of generating binary patches for deployed systems.

It involves developing software tools and algorithms, which are capable of automatically detecting and fixing software bugs. This process can save developers a tremendous amount of time and effort, as well as reduce the risk of errors occurring in production environments. The automatic bug fixing process generally consists of three stages: bug identification, bug analysis, and bug fixing. In the first stage (bug identification) developers use static and dynamic test techniques in order to identify software bugs and potential vulnerabilities. They typically use static techniques such as static code analysis and static testing, while dynamic techniques involve the real-time execution of the code with the use of system performance metrics. In the second stage (bug analysis), developers use specialized software tools and techniques to investigate the behavior of the software in order to identify the cause and effect relationship between the bug and the code. This stage involves some degree of manual analysis, as developers must manually inspect the code, identify which areas of code ought to be tested, and identify the overall causes for the software defect. The third and final stage (bug fixing) is the result of a successful bug analysis. At this point, developers use specialized techniques such as program transformation, program slicing, and data flow analysis to repair the code and eliminate the defects. In addition, they may also utilize refactoring techniques to make the code more efficient and reliable. Overall, automatic bug fixing is a powerful tool for developers, who must deploy and maintain high-quality software applications. It offers the potential for significant reductions in development time, cost and risk. One of its advantages over traditional manual testing is its ability to detect and fix bugs on a more continuous basis, leading to rapid bug detection and correction. Moreover, it has the potential to provide developers with feedback about the integrity of their codebase, as well as allowing them to identify potential vulnerabilities.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48892446}

Here,  values of shift factor aT are obtained by horizontal shift log(aT) of creep compliance data plotted vs. time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature T superposes with the data set at temperature Tr. A minimum of three values of aT are needed to obtain C1, C2, and typically more than three are used.\n\nOnce constructed, the WLF equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested. In this way, the master curve can be applied to other temperatures. However, when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the  glass transition temperature (Tg), the WLF equation is applicable to temperatures at or above Tg only; the constants are positive and represent Arrhenius behavior. Extrapolation to temperatures below Tg is erroneous. When the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below Tg, negative values of C1, C2 are obtained, which are not applicable above Tg and do not represent Arrhenius behavior. Therefore, the constants obtained above Tg are not useful for predicting the response of the polymer for structural applications, which necessarily must operate at temperatures below Tg.\n\nThe WLF equation is a consequence of time\u2013temperature superposition (TTSP), which mathematically is an application of\nBoltzmann's superposition principle. It is TTSP, not WLF, that allows the assembly of a compliance master curve that spans more time, or frequency, than afforded by the time available for experimentation or the frequency range of the instrumentation, such as dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).\n\nWhile the time span of a TTSP master curve is broad, according to Struik, it is valid only if the data sets did not suffer from ageing effects during the test time. Even then, the master curve represents a hypothetical material that does not age. Effective Time Theory. needs to be used to obtain useful prediction for long term time.\n\nHaving data above Tg, it is possible to predict the behavior (compliance, storage modulus, etc.) of viscoelastic materials for temperatures T>Tg, and/or for times/frequencies longer/slower than the time available for experimentation. With the master curve and associated WLF equation it is possible to predict the mechanical properties of the polymer out of time scale of the machine (typically  to  Hz), thus extrapolating the results of multi-frequency analysis to a broader range, out of measurement range of machine.\n\nPredicting the Effect of Temperature on Viscosity  by the WLF Equation \n\nThe Williams-Landel-Ferry model, or WLF for short, is usually used for polymer melts or other fluids that have a glass transition temperature.\n\nThe model is:\n\nwhere T-temperature, , ,  and  are empiric parameters (only three of them are independent from each other).\n\nIf one selects the parameter  based on the glass transition temperature, then the parameters ,  become very similar for the wide class of polymers.

It is a phenomenological equation that is used to describe how different substances display different mechanical or thermal behavior under varying conditions, including stress, temperature, and strain. The WLF equation has been used extensively in a variety of engineering fields, including materials science and catalysis. The WLF equation was derived by British materials scientist W.G. Williams in 1935 and was further refined by F.H. Landel and M.F. Ferry in 1955. It is often referred to as the Williams\u2013Landel\u2013Ferry equation, or simply the WLF equation. The WLF equation is applicable to most unnatural substances, such as plastics, elastomers, rubbers, and viscous liquids, at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The WLF equation expresses time-dependent behavior as a function of temperature, and is expressed as follows: \u1e91 = A exp[\u03b1(T - T\u1d62)] + B exp[-\u03b2(T - T\u1d62)] where \u1e91 is the response/behavior of the material, T is the absolute temperature, T\u1d62 is a reference temperature, A and B are constants, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are parameters that represent the structural changes of the material with temperature. The two terms in the equation represent two distinct parameters. The first term (A exp[\u03b1(T - T\u1d62)]) is referred to as the time-temperature superposition term, which is related to the rubber-like molecular response of the material in question. The second term (B exp[-\u03b2(T - T\u1d62)]) is called the glassy state term, which is related to the glassy state of the material. The WLF equation can be used to describe a variety of material behaviors, including viscoelasticity, temperature-dependent mechanical properties, creep, and relaxation. It is applicable to most unnatural materials over a wide range of temperatures, and is one of the most widely used equations in engineering due to its simplicity and ease of use. Its accuracy depends on adequate characterization of the material for which it is being applied, as well as empirical data for the parameters that are used with the equation. The WLF equation is widely used in a variety of fields, including polymers, catalysis, materials science, mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. It has been used to model a wide range of materials, including polymers, viscous liquids, solids, and rubber-like materials.

He made his first appearance on 21 November 2002, and left on 25 December 2005. He returned to EastEnders on 21 September 2010, following the return of on-screen wife Kat (Jessie Wallace) two episodes previously.\n\nSome of the character's more prominent storylines have included: his turbulent relationship withand later marriage toKat Slater; the dementia and death of his grandmother, Nana (Hilda Braid); believing that Kat's son Tommy had died of cot death, whereas in truth their neighbour Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) had switched him with her own deceased child; discovering that Kat had been sleeping with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman); beginning a relationship with Ronnie's sister Roxy (Rita Simons) and marrying her, but reuniting with Kat moments after the wedding; Kat's pregnancy with twinsBert and Ernie, destroying their home by committing arson to get the insurance money; winning the lottery; being diagnosed with a brain tumour; and reuniting with Kat until they split again when she discovers that he is the father of Cherry Slater.\n\nRichie and Wallace departed on-screen on 22 May 2015 before returning for a short stint from 26 December 2015 to 25 January 2016, before appearing in the six-part drama spin-off series, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, airing from 14 May 2017 until 18 June 2017. In March 2018, it was announced that Alfie would return to the show. He appeared on-screen on 24 and 25 May 2018 and returned again on 15 November 2018 and from 30 November 2018 to 22 January 2019.\n\nStorylines\n\n2002\u20132005\nAlfie Moon first appears when he is ejected from Walford East tube station for fare evasion. He then causes havoc in the local market by getting a refund from Winston (Ulric Browne) for a video he stole and tricking Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou) into giving him free fruit. After acquainting himself with a few residents, he sneaks into The Queen Victoria public house and helps himself to a drink behind the bar. The landlady, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), assumes that Alfie is Chris Wright (Tom Roberts), the new manager sent by an agency. Alfie takes advantage of the misunderstanding to commit identity fraud against Wright. Alfie packs any stock he could find in a bin bag, ready to leave. Jim Branning (John Bardon) catches him, but assumes Alfie is throwing away outdated stock and tricks Alfie into giving him a pint on the house. Winston, Martin, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) realize that Alfie has told them all different background stories but he manages to reconcile the inconsistent stories. Alfie later answers the phone to the real Chris Wright and tells him the position is filled, revealing his intention to stay. Alfie's brother and grandmother arrive unannounced in Albert Square and move into the pub with Alfie, much to his dismay. When Alfie is blackmailed by a former police officer, Dougie Slade (John Bowler), who reveals Alfie's true identity to Peggy, Alfie and his family are forced to flee with the pub's takings. However, Alfie leaves the money on Peggy's doorstep. Peggy manages to track him down and after he confides in her about his parents' death, she gives him another chance. Alfie reluctantly accepts her proposal.\n\nAlfie shares a bond with barmaid Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and an attraction develops. Eventually Kat reciprocates his feelings and one night when the pub is closed, Kat reveals her feelings to him. They decide to embark on their relationship slowly, but his inability to trust her causes her to rethink the romance and she breaks up with Alfie, within less than a week. Alfie is heartbroken when Kat returns from a trip to New York with local mobster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), who soon becomes engaged to Kat after the trip. Andy, knowing Alfie's feelings for Kat, warns him to stay away from her and the wedding. Before the wedding, Kat visits Alfie's grandmother, Nana Moon (Hilda Braid) in hospital, and thinking she is asleep, admits she still loves Alfie. Nana tells Alfie and he rushes to the wedding to confess his true feelings as the ceremony takes place. Kat jilts Andy and he swears revenge before leaving Walford. Alfie and Kat quickly get engaged and decide to hold the wedding on Christmas Day, less than a month away. However, Alfie is still married to his first wife, Liza (Joanne Adams). Liza's mother, Marlene (Christine Ellerbeck) tells Alfie that their divorce is finalised, so he starts to prepare the wedding to Kat, until Liza reveals they are not divorced. There are only a few days before the wedding so he tries to quickly finalise the divorce while trying to keep it secret from Kat, though Liza makes it difficult as she wants Alfie to take her back. Alfie is forced to cancel the minister on Christmas Day and he panics, but gets his friend Ray (David Walliams) to pretend to be a minister, while planning to tell Kat the truth a few days later. Alfie's brother, Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker), warns Alfie not to start his marriage with a lie, so Alfie reveals the truth to a furious Kat. Alfie is about to tell the guests that the wedding is cancelled when his solicitor enters with Alfie's decree absolute. Alfie convinces the minister to cancel his Christmas lunch, and Alfie and Kat marry.\n\nAfter a while, Alfie borrows several thousand pounds from Andy to bail out Kat's father, Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), who has been arrested for assault. Andy begins demanding cash every week, which he knows Alfie cannot afford. Andy's plan to wreck the Moons' marriage starts to work and Andy offers Kat the chance to pay off the debt by spending time with him in bed. She reluctantly agrees and they sleep together, with a reluctant Kat oozing with guilt. Though unknown to her, Alfie has paid Andy the money. Andy keeps the money and gives Alfie a video tape of Kat cheating on Alfie with him. They watch the sex tape together and she reveals the whole story behind her infidelity. When Alfie insults Kat, she slaps him, with him doing the same thing. Afterwards, the couple attempt to put the incident behind them but their marriage starts to deteriorate and Alfie is unable to trust Kat. She moves out of Walford for while. During her return, it is seen that Kat has become an alcoholic and isn't bothered by the fact that Alfie wants them to resume their marriage. Kat has sex with Roger (Russell Boulter), a stranger, while intoxicated and finally sees sense, deciding to return to Alfie, but he discovers she has slept with a man she doesn't know and throws her out, so she leaves Walford again.\n\nAlfie shares a mutual connection with Kat's sister, Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), whose marriage to Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) has collapsed. Alfie helps Little Mo bring up her baby, Freddie, and they decide to announce that they are an item. However, Kat returns before they have a chance, and she makes it clear that she wants Alfie back. He is torn between the two sisters, eventually choosing Kat. He lets Little Mo down gently, and they share a final goodbye hug, which Billy assumes is them getting together. In the pub, Billy drunkenly announces that Alfie and Little Mo are an item. Kat is furious and decides not to get together with Alfie, so as not to break her sister's heart. However, Alfie and Kat continue to grow closer, due to Kat's relationship with Alfie's grandmother, who is dying. After Kat helps Alfie complete some of Nana's final wishes and overcome her death, they long for each other. Alfie announces that he is leaving to drive across the United States in a Ford Capri, and it seems he has gone for good when he waves goodbye to a heartbroken Kat on Christmas Day 2005. After getting drunk and drowning her sorrows in the pub, Kat is stunned to see Alfie waiting for her outside. Kat and Alfie then get into the car together and drive off.\n\n2010\u20132016\n\nKat returns to London, revealing that she and Alfie conned a man called Frankie Finnerty and she is now on the run. His relatives Lee and Jono Finnerty (Dylan Brown and Colin Parry) track her down but Alfie scares them off by pretending to be a CID officer, though they take most of Kat's money. Alfie and Kat have a heart to heart and it is revealed that Alfie spent six months in prison for property fraud and they tried to have a baby but he has fertility problems. Kat is not interested and tries to leave, telling him that she is pregnant and he is not the father. Alfie doubles the remainder of Kat's money in a bet and promises to stop scamming and get a proper job. Kat gives him 24 hours. He uses Kat's money and uses it to rent The Queen Vic from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Kat is angry and demands he get the money back as they need a regular income. Instead, he sets up an illegal drinking den in the cellar and they move into Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) caravan on the Square.\n\nAlfie hires Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) to refurbish The Queen Vic and Alfie's cousin, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), gives him money for The Queen Vic lease. He introduces Michael to Kat and Michael says that he is returning to Spain and asks her to go with him. He leaves a letter and some money for Alfie, revealing that he is the baby's father. Alfie tells Kat that he wants the baby but she doesn't believe him and agrees to leave with Michael but changes her mind when she sees that Alfie has bought a cot and some baby toys. Alfie struggles to pay the rent and tries gambling again but loses. However, Phil's cousin Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) helps out by paying two months rent for him and he shows Kat the newly refurbished pub. However, on the day of the grand opening, there is a problem so the pub doesn't open until the next day. Kat sees Alfie and Roxy together and fights with Roxy. Alfie takes Roxy's side and ejects Kat but they reconcile and Alfie suggests renewing their wedding vows and Kat agrees. The day does not go quite according to plan as Alfie helps Roxy with her sister Ronnie Mitchell's (Samantha Womack) wedding. However, Kat decides that she does not need a big ceremony so she and Alfie have one in the Square with just him and Kat.\n\nKat gives birth to a boy named Tommy but is rushed to hospital as she haemorrhages, due to a damaged placenta. Charlie decides to join the New Year's party, rather than stay with Tommy so he is unattended when Ronnie Mitchell finds herself in The Queen Vic with her dead son and she swaps the babies. When Alfie gets home, he finds \"Tommy\" dead in his cot. Kat and Alfie struggle to cope with their loss but eventually start to deal with it until Michael returns, wanting to see his son. Kat tells Michael to leave but he stays because he has friends locally. Kat kisses Michael but he rejects her, leading her to break down. Eventually Alfie moves out after they have a row and goes away for a weekend with Michael. Kat tells Alfie that a coroner has confirmed that Tommy (James) died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He comforts her and they reconcile. Eventually, Ronnie admits to Kat that she swapped the babies and returns Tommy. Alfie and Kat are reunited with Tommy after talking to a social worker. Ronnie goes to prison for her crime and Kat forgives her. She and Alfie holiday in Spain, leaving Alfie's cousin, Eddie Moon (David Essex), to look after the pub. When they return, they bring Shenice Quinn (Lily Harvey) with them, daughter of Kat's friend, Martina Quinn (Tamara Wall). Kat finds out she is pregnant and Alfie asks who the father is, refusing to believe Kat has not cheated. Alfie realises he has gone too far but Kat is not interested in his apologies, even after she miscarries. She tells him she does not want any more children and that their relationship will just be for show from now on, leading her to have a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she regrets after hearing Alfie's voicemail, saying how much he loves her. Alfie takes Kat, Tommy and Shenice on holiday but when they return, Kat tells Alfie that she cheated. They discuss it and Alfie insists that he would rather Kat cheat on him than not have her in his life. Kat isn't happy and is further upset when Alfie will not allow her to explain that she did not cheat again. They try to mend things over Christmas but Alfie hears Kat say that she does not think he loves her. Alfie pays a friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) to claim he is a marriage counsellor and tell Kat that their marriage can be mended. However, when Alfie deliberately leaves them alone, she says she thinks Alfie does not love her and she wants to end the marriage. Gerry tries to tell Alfie but he thinks that Gerry has helped. When Charlie has a stroke, Alfie and Kat visit but he returns alone. Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) gets Alfie into a VAT scam and Alfie helps Roxy and Billy set Derek up by intercepting his alcohol deliveries. Alfie struggles financially and considers firing Jean and stores Derek's goods at the pub to earn extra cash but when Phil demands Alfie stop, Derek arranges with Alfie and Billy to steal a large amount of alcohol. However, Derek is scammed by Alfie and Billy and he suspects Phil conned him. When Billy is arrested on suspicion of murdering Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Derek worries that he may implicate them in the alcohol theft and asks Alfie to frame Phil by hiding goods at his garage. However, Alfie is caught and Phil confronts him, making it clear that Alfie takes orders from him, not Derek. When Derek learns that Alfie has told Phil everything, he furiously threatens Alfie.\n\nIn Kat's absence, Alfie and Roxy become close friends and Roxy tells Alfie that she is in love with him. This makes things awkward and she quits her job at the pub. After a while, Alfie manages to convince Roxy to return and offers her a place to stay. Jean is conned out of money that belongs to The Queen Victoria while Alfie is away and when he returns, he borrows money from Roxy to pay the bills, angering Kat. Alfie starts a pub football team and pays more attention to that than to Kat, so she starts an affair. Kat tries to resist but eventually the affair turns to love. When Kat's lover sends her flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious and asks Kat if she is seeing someone else. She denies it initially but eventually admits it, refusing to say who the other man is. Alfie demand Kat end the affair but Alfie struggles to trust Kat, especially when he finds a ring he thought had been pawned. Wanting to catch her out, Alfie says he will be away overnight and follows her to a nearby flat, demanding to know who Kat is seeing but she still refuses to name him. Alfie finds a letter to \"Mr. Branning\" and confronts the three brothers, attacking Max when he sees that Kat is calling. Kat arrives and tells him that she is seeing Derek. Alfie throws Kat out again and Derek makes matters worse when he plays Alfie a message, asking to meet. Alfie punches Derek and tells him that he is barred before giving Derek his wedding ring to give to Kat. Alfie starts dating Roxy and asks her to move in and they declare their love for each other. Alfie helps Kat when she is questioned over stolen goods, but to prove to Roxy that he loves her, Alfie decides to get a divorce. Alfie and Roxy decide to try for a baby, but when Kat and Alfie's decree nisi comes through, it is apparent that Alfie still loves Kat. He is determined to move on so proposes to Roxy and she accepts.\n\nAlfie discovers Ronnie is being released from prison but thinks that she will not return to Walford. He is angry to discover that she has and demands Roxy choose, him or Ronnie. Roxy chooses Alfie but Kat persuades him to accept Ronnie's presence and let Roxy see her sister. Kat supports Alfie after Michael's death and the two become closer. The night before his wedding, Alfie visits Kat and they kiss passionately. On his wedding day, Alfie tells Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) that he still loves Kat but marries Roxy. Roxy realises that Alfie is still in love with Kat and orders him out of the church. He learns that Kat is going to Ibiza and races to the airport. They reconcile, moments before her flight is due to depart. As revenge for Alfie's treatment of Roxy, Phil sells The Queen Vic, forcing Alfie and Kat out. Kat tells Alfie that she is pregnant and they move in with Kat's grandmother, Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Kat has a market stall, selling women's clothes, but Alfie isn't as successful as goes to help Spencer  in Australia for a while. He returns a month later and tells Kat that he has just bought a classic Ford Capri. After a night in a posh hotel, they return to Walford and Alfie sets up a burger bar on the Square but this is taken away so he sets up a men's clothes stall instead. This doesn't last thanks to a feud with the market inspector, Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling), so he gets a job at Ian's caf\u00e9. Kat and Alfie are thrilled when their twin sons, Bert and Ernie (Freddie and Stanley Beale), are born.\n\nAlfie receives a letter from the council, stating that they are due to be evicted from No. 23 Albert Square. He doesn't tell Kat but Stacey finds it and forces him to tell Kat and Mo. Alfie tells Kat that he has got a bank loan but considers starting a fire for the insurance money. Despite Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) advising him against it, he drops a lit cigarette into a paper-filled wastebasket. When outside, he learns Kat is in the house and rushes back to rescue her but Mo's stash of dodgy hairspray causes an explosion, just as Alfie opens the front door. He rescues Kat regardless, receiving minor burns, but Kat is badly burnt. Alfie and the Moons are supported by the local community and stay with the Masood family. Alfie is praised as a hero, despite being suspected by local firefighter Tosh. However, the fire investigation officer declares the fire an accident but Mick advises him not to tell Kat that he started the fire and when Kat thanks him for saving her life, he takes Mick's advice. He is relieved when the fire investigation officer Neil Wallace informs him that the insurers will probably pay for the damage to be repaired but Stacey finds the picture of Nana Moon and realises Alfie started the fire and demands Alfie tell Kat but he refuses, creating a rift between them. The insurance company also refuse to pay for the damage as Mo's quantity of hairspray is listed as commercial goods, invalidating the policy. He tells Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and she suggests ringing the insurance company again but Alfie refuses, adamant that they won\u2019t change their decision and blames Mo. Stacey then suggests Alfie use the proceeds from selling the Capri to sort out their finances but he can't as the money was spent on food and the children. Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) returns home and asks Alfie when they will be moving out as the house is too crowded but Alfie loses his temper with Masood and accuses him of kicking them out.\n\nNeeding a place of their own, Alfie tries to persuade an estate agent to let him stay in number 43 for a couple of nights but the agent dismisses the idea. So he goes to the council for temporary accommodation and is told that all they can offer is one night in a bed and breakfast. Returning to the Square, Alfie tells Stacey about the mess they\u2019re in and she insists he tell Kat the truth but before he can, she asks him to marry her. He agrees and they marry at the registrar's office with two nurses as witnesses and return to Walford. They squat in a couple of places before Mick invites them to stay at The Queen Vic. After an emotional speech from Kat to the social housing manager, they are offered a council house in Hull but just as they are about to leave, Kat finds a photo of Nana. Wanting to know how it survived the fire, Alfie admits that he started it and tries to apologise, but Kat leaves him, moving in with Stacey and Lily. Later, as Christmas approaches, Alfie tells Kat that he will try to fix things.\n\nMo tells Kat that Harry left her some money in his will. Alfie finds out, and tries to convince her to use the money to make a fresh start after the divorce but she destroys the cheque, insisting it doesn't change the past nor their impending divorce. Kat has second thoughts about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family and Stacey tells Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling financially so Alfie invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the kids, but at Stacey's urging, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire.\n\nMo has Harry's money transferred to her account and tells Alfie. He insists that this is not good for Kat and tells her so she burns the money. Sadly, this makes her very depressed and she tries to commit suicide but Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance. At the hospital, he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily to help her with the kids and her assessment by Social Services. During the social worker's visit, Kat is withdrawn and won't answer questions, insisting she is fine but Alfie tells the social worker that they are working on it and admits feeling guilty for starting the fire. After Kat visits a convent (Zoe's birthplace), she makes peace with the past and tells Alfie and Stacey that she will claim the money. Alfie and Stacey discover that Kat's claim won't grant her any money so he takes Kat on a trip to central London, giving them a chance to reminisce before having lunch at a posh restaurant. Kat knows that she won't get any compensation and is disgusted when Alfie tells her he already knew. Soon after, Kat takes the opportunity to tell Alfie that she wants them to reconcile and although initially resisting, he changes his mind once back in Walford. On the spur of the moment, they buy a scratchcard and realise they have won \u00a31,000,000. Alfie and Kat decide to use the money to move somewhere new and run a bar. Alfie suggests going to Australia but he and Kat decide to return to Spain so she can be closer to Zoe. But after tests, a doctor tells Alfie he may have a brain tumour. Kat buys plane tickets for the next day and Alfie chooses not to tell Kat about the tumour and ignore warnings that the tumour will grow. Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) also advises him not to fly as this could cause problems so they drive to Spain.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015, Kat returns to Walford to spend Christmas with Stacey. Alfie follows with the boys. While at Mick's stag party, Alfie tells Ian and Phil that he may have a brain tumour. Ian and Phil go with him to a hospital appointment, where he learns that the tumour has stopped growing but he may need an operation if he begins showing symptoms. Alfie tells Kat about his tumour and in turn, Kat tells Alfie that she has a son living in Ireland. After Charlie dies from a heart attack, Kat and Alfie decide to search for her son. After saying their goodbyes, Kat and Alfie depart.\n\nKat & Alfie: Redwater\nIn episode 1 of Kat & Alfie: Redwater, Alfie, Kat and Tommy arrive in the Irish town of Redwater, saying they are on holiday. Alfie tells Kat to make friends before asking questions and trying to find her son and when she immediately thinks it is Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion), Alfie warns her that she could be wrong. Alfie starts to have visions and gets scared when he goes outside in the night and almost falls from a cliff. Alfie finds out about the Redwater Tragedy from local priest, Dermott Dolan (Ois\u00edn Stack), in which Dermott's mother, Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) drowned in a boating accident. In episode 2, Alfie gets stuck up a cliff when helping Tommy, but Dermott rescues him. Tommy goes missing but Kat finds him in the church and discovers that Dermott is her son. In episode 3, Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott about who Dermott's father is, which results in an argument. By episode 5, Alfie is worried about his hallucinations and has a brain scan, lying to Kat about where he is going. He then tells Dermott that his tumour has grown and asks Dermott to baptise him, which he does. In episode 6, Alfie prepares for an operation on his brain, and is told his recovery could take weeks so he will be unable to return to Spain as planned. He asks Dermott to bring Kat to the hospital, but Dermott does not do this because the police suspect he was involved in the death of Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney). Alfie is unable to wait and during the surgery, Alfie loses his pulse and at the same time, Kat is seriously injured in a boating accident caused by Dermott's attempting to escape. Medical staff start to resuscitate Alfie as the episode ends.\n\n2018\u20132019\nHaving recovered from his operation, Alfie and Kat return to Spain to run a bar. Mo returns in March 2018 and reveals that Kat and Alfie had an argument and that he fled with the children shortly afterwards and no one knows where he is. On her return to Walford shortly afterwards, Kat reveals that Alfie is in Spain with their children, running a different bar with a Russian partner, Dimitri, after their old bar lost a fortune. She insists that the two are taking a break from their marriage. Two months later, Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis) visits Alfie, who is staying in London, and it is revealed that Alfie threw Kat out after Tommy accidentally caused severe burns to Ernie while she was in bed with Dimitri. Hayley reveals that she is pregnant and that Alfie is the father following a drunken one-night stand in Spain. Alfie tries to persuade Hayley to terminate the pregnancy and returns to Spain, but Hayley decides to keep the baby.\n\nKat gets a video call from Alfie and he asks her to collect something for him. Believing him to still be in Spain, she follows his instructions and goes to a chapel where she is surprised to see Alfie in person. Alfie is running a funeral business and has many clients lined up, but Kat is unimpressed and only sees it as a scam. She is angry that he has not brought their children with him, but apologies for cheating on him with Dimitri. Kat tells him to stop his lies and jokes and she leaves. The following week Kat speaks to Alfie, who is back in Spain, by video call and she is angry when he says he lied to her and actually did bring the children with him to London. Two weeks later, during Hayley's birthday party, Kat answers the door and is shocked to see Alfie standing on the doorstep. Though he reunites with Kat, he is stunned to realise that Hayley did not terminate her pregnancy, and insists they keep the truth hidden from Kat. Hayley develops feelings for him when she sees him bond with their daughter, named Cherry by Alfie after his deceased mother. Jean, who is the only one who has found out about Alfie being Cherry's father, insists that Alfie tell Kat or she will.\n\nStacey sees Hayley and Alfie kissing and is horrified to uncover Cherry's paternity and issues an ultimatum: one of them leaves, or Kat learns the truth. Hayley decides to go, but her parting gift to Alfie \u2013 a lock of Cherry's hair \u2013 is discovered by Kat and she works out the truth. After a furious showdown, Alfie turns nasty with Kat, who accuses him of taking advantage of Hayley's vulnerability. Hayley defends Kat and pushes Alfie, causing him to fall down the stairs and knock himself unconscious. Believing that he is dead, Hayley, Kat and Stacey discuss what to do to protect Hayley from going to prison. Kat privately says a tender goodbye to Alfie, kissing him and telling him she loves him. As the police arrive, they discover that Alfie survived and has left, taking Cherry with him. The next day, Alfie meets Phil, who gives him fake passports but warns Alfie to think carefully about his plans. Alfie then listens to a voicemail Kat left him on his phone, pleading with him to bring Cherry back. Alfie eventually contacts Kat and Hayley via video chat and says he will bring Cherry back soon. On New Year's Day, Alfie and Kat meet and Kat tries to talk him into returning Cherry but Alfie admits he cannot bring himself to do it, fearing he would only be granted limited visitation time, and suggests he and Kat adopt Cherry and leave together. Kat tells Alfie she accepts and brings Alfie to the house, claiming it is empty but when Alfie arrives, he is confronted by Stacey, Mo and Jean. Angry and upset, he shows them Ernie's scars caused by Kat's irresponsibility. When Kat takes the children for ice cream, she gives Alfie the option to take them with him on the condition that he brings Cherry back to Hayley. Alfie eventually relents to return Cherry and leave their children with Kat, admitting that he loves her and only wanted her to be happy. The next day, after emotionally attempting to say goodbye to Cherry, Alfie changes his mind and attempts to drive out of Walford with her but finds himself stuck in traffic. This forces him to reevaluate his decision and he turns back and returns Cherry to Hayley. An overjoyed but protective Hayley tells a dejected Alfie that she cannot let him be a part of Cherry's life. After learning of this from Ian, a sympathetic Kat allows him to spend time with their children.\n\nSeveral days later, Alfie does some DIY work at the Slater house, while Kat resists all his attempts to charm her but eventually relents to an early birthday lunch at The Queen Vic with him, Mo, Stacey, her husband Martin Fowler (James Bye), Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and Cherry, whom Hayley allows him to bring along for the day. After finding that his credit card has been declined and making a toast to Kat, Alfie receives a phone call from the bank, causing him to rush over to the Beale house where he is staying where he finds overdue bills from running his funeral business. The next day, after Alfie unsuccessfully tries to help Hayley with feeding Cherry her breast milk, the father of a deceased client accuses Alfie of stealing his son's money after a mix-up with the funeral plans, and Ian threatens to kick Alfie out for stealing his food. Under stress, Alfie confesses his troubles to a horrified Kat, including the fact that some of the money was paid for her new fireplace. In order to reimburse the client's family and pay the bills, Alfie decides to look for investors for the business and Ian offers to buy a 50% stake in the business for a loan with 20% interest, which he accepts. Later, after explaining this to a concerned Kat, who reprimands him for his schemes, Alfie and the rest of the Slaters are stunned to find Hayley unconscious from drinking after locking herself in the bathroom with Cherry. Knowing she is struggling being a mother, Alfie suggests to Kat that they adopt Cherry, but Kat is unsure. Soon after, customers of Alfie's funeral business start contacting him and one coming to see him in person, accusing him of swindling them of money. Needing to pay them back, he persuades Phil to lend him 30,000 pounds and offering his expensive car as collateral. Alfie then does a runner and Phil is angry when he takes the money and the car with him. Phil threatens Kat, saying she will pay back the money to him if Alfie does not. When she gets a text from Alfie telling her to look in the wardrobe, she is stunned when the money falls out of it, having left it behind for her. Although the text says he will be returning soon, he does not come back. Kat uses the money to pay for Jean's cancer treatment, leaving her in further debt to Phil. Phil later demands Kat find Alfie but she assures him she does not know where he is.\n\nCreation and development\nAlfie Moon was conceptualised by EastEnders''' scriptwriter Tony Jordan. The character is based on Jordan himself. Jordan has commented, \"Alfie is basically me \u2013 a Jack The Lad in jeans, cowboy boots and dodgy shirts who wears his heart on his sleeve.\" Julia Crampsie, the BBC's casting executive, recommended that Shane Richie be considered for the role. Richie was already a familiar face to the UK audience, having had a career as an entertainer, appearing in various gameshows, variety shows and fronting advertising campaigns, most notably for the washing detergent Daz. Jordan was apprehensive about casting Ritchie in the role. He commented, \"I just had this image of the guy with the mullet from the Daz adverts. And if we had Shane where would it stop? Harry Hill? Les Dennis? Bradley Walsh? But Julia was insistent, so I went to a workshop where we'd see lots of actors and [Richie] was fantastic.\"\n\nJordan has suggested that many of the rows featured on-screen between Alfie and his love-interest Kat were word-for-word arguments he had with his wife, Tracy. He commented, \"We'd be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and I'd think, 'Oh shit', because I'd know what was coming. And then we'd have another row about how I don't argue properly because when we do argue I'm just making mental notes for stuff to write the next day.\"\n\nReintroduction (2010)\nOn 7 February 2010 it was announced that Richie would return to the show to reprise the role in autumn 2010. The decision was made following the resignation from the show of Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy Mitchell, which left what executive producer Bryan Kirkwood described as a \"hole\" in the programme. Kirkwood decided that the time was right for Kat and Alfie to return, saying that they \"very much herald the new era of EastEnders.\" Richie had ruled out a return in 2009, saying that the show had moved on from his character and he felt he did not have the energy to be in such a \"full-on\" show again. Richie commented on his return: \"It's an honour and a privilege to be asked back to the iconic series of EastEnders which is at the top of its game! I'm looking forward to finding out what Alfie has been up to over the last few years but more importantly \u2013 what the future has in store for him.\" John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, said: \"Alfie is one of EastEnders most loved and iconic characters, so he's bound to get a very warm welcome from viewers when he returns to Walford. We've had so many new and interesting characters settle into Albert Square since Alfie departed that it's going to make for fantastic viewing when one of the show's most familiar faces rides back into the East End.\" It was reported by The Daily Mirror that Alfie and Kat would regain control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burns down. Controller of BBC drama production John Yorke predicted that their return would make \"fantastic viewing\", given the wealth of new characters introduced since their departure. Wallace and Richie were the first cast members signed by new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood.\n\nThe plot saw Alfie and Kat regaining control of The Queen Victoria public house after it burned down, and Kat returning to Walford pregnant, with some public suspicions about the paternity of her child. To promote the characters' return, the BBC released a trailer across the BBC network in September 2010. The western-themed trailer sees Kat outside of The Queen Victoria, with various characters looking on and Kat saying \"Where d'ya get a drink around 'ere?\" with Alfie replying \"I think you're gonna' need one.\" The advertisement uses the tag line \"It's all kicking off in the square\". The return, in September 2010, drew 9.22 million viewers and 37.7% of the total TV viewing audience. Kat returned on 17 September 2010.\n\nTalking to What's on TV, Wallace commented on Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: \"She punches him! Alfie has come looking for her and hasn't seen her for months. He keeps saying to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will always end up together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this challenge and he buys it.\"\n\nBaby swap\n\nRichie revealed in an interview with This Morning that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is \"going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps.\" At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, \"We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will do the right thing and Tommy will be reunited with Kat.\" Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was \"just doing her job\". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:\"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it.\" She also praised Womack's acting and will move on to \"bigger and better things\" once she departs later this year. She added: \"[Samantha is] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best.\"\n\nDerek Martin said he was surprised by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: \"I'm one of those actors \u2013 I don't know how many others do it \u2013 but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked [and saw], 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk \u2013 the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously \u2013 because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I was surprised when I saw the story come out \u2013 because I don't read the others' [lines] \u2013 that it was a baby swap.\" Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: \"Don't forget, there's millions of people \u2013 there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up\u2026 everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public \u2013 some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is.\"  He continues: \"Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [Charlie's] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life.\"\n\nSamantha Womack admitted that she thought the plot was \"implausible\". She commented: \"I thought it was implausible. Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one,\" she told The Mirror. \"But Ronnie is a soap character and she is not necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it.\" On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented \"in an offensive manner\" because it \"appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss\". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: \"Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can you have in one square? There's a nod to real life but, for the most part, soaps help take people out of the real world.\"\n\nArson, second departure and Redwater\n\nIn August 2014, it was revealed that a fire would engulf the Slater house. On 2 September, it was revealed that Alfie would start the fire in return of an insurance claim, after having been broke following the birth of the twins, with Kat still inside. The fire and its aftermath took place on the week of 15 September 2014.\n\nOn 4 April 2015, it was announced that Richie would appear in a six-part BBC One drama series alongside Wallace. In the series, Kat and Alfie Moon will go to Ireland in the \"search for answers to some very big questions\". Commenting on the opportunity, Richie said: \"Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming.\" The series, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, started in the UK on 18 May 2017 and Ireland on 14 May 2017.\n\nReturn (2018)\n\nIn March 2018 it was confirmed that Alfie would return to the show for a short stint to rejoin Kat. It was said that Richie would start filming in the coming weeks, and Alfie would reappear from summer 2018. He returned on 24 May 2018, appearing for two episodes before making another brief return between November 2018 and January 2019.\n\nReception\n\nRichie has received immediate acclaim for bringing humour to a programme so depressing and has won a number of awards and nominations for his portrayal of Alfie. In the National Television Awards, he won Most Popular Actor in 2003, with nominations in 2004 and 2005. He was nominated in the Best Newcomer and Best Comedy Performance categories at the British Soap Awards in 2003, and won Best Actor in 2004 along with nominations for Best Comedy Performance and Best On-Screen Partnership (shared with Wallace). He also won Best Actor in 2005, and was nominated in 2006, as well as being nominated for Best Exit along with Wallace in 2006.  He was further nominated in 2011 for 'Best Actor.

He was elected and served on the Little Rock City Board of Directors, the Pulaski County Quorum Court and in the Arkansas State Legislature representing the district in which he resided. He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he was succeeded by his wife, Wilhelmina Lewellen who served until 2010. John Lewellen is the only Arkansas official to have been elected and represented his district on the city, county and state level.\n\nJohn Marshall Lewellen was born September 16, 1930 in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He was the 11th of 13 children born to Cornelius and Jesse Lewellen. He attended Dansby Elementary School and  professed a hope in Christ at an early age at Taylor Chapel which was named after his grandfather, Taylor Dansby. \nHe graduated from Lincoln High School in Forrest City and served in the U.S. Air Force 1951-1955 during the Korean War. \n \nThe first of his family to attend college, John attended Arkansas AM&N (now UAPB) where he met Wilhelmina Epps.  They were married on November 25, 1956.  Their first daughter, Ivie Rochelle, was born while they pursued and completed their college education. \n \nAfter graduating from AM&N in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, John Lewellen and his family moved to the Altheimer/Hermitage area, where he worked as a high school teacher and principal.  The family moved to Little Rock after the birth of their second daughter, Cornelia Ann, where John began his 30-year career in state government as a state probation officer, state rehabilitation counselor and later as a contractor officer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.\n\nOver the past 54 years, John Lewellen was a highly respected member of the Little Rock community and his neighborhood.  He gave back to the community by buying and rehabbing apartments and homes, ultimately purchasing a senior citizen apartment building, which he named ConIvie Gardens, after his two daughters.  He co-founded the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, one of the strongest neighborhood groups in the city.  To many, he was \"Mr. Lew,\" the \"go-to guy\" for advice and guidance, and a mentor to youths, especially young men.  Many would spend Saturdays with him doing yard work, washing cars, or repairs at his rental properties, while he taught them the importance of a strong work ethic and being a strong black man.\n\nJohn Lewellen wanted to do even more for the community and decided to run for public office.  He was elected to the Little Rock City Board in 1991 and the Pulaski County Quorum Court in 1996.

He was the primary and lead sponsor of House Bill 1923 - AN ACT TO CREATE THE MOSAIC TEMPLARS OF AMERICA CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.  This legislation generated more than $5 million for restoring the Mosaic Templars Culture Center, a museum of the Dept. of Arkansas Heritage that houses the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame as well as a collection of African American artifacts. The Mosaic Templars Museum is part of the Arkansas Black Heritage Tour and is Arkansas's only state-funded museum of African American History. John Lewellen received numerous awards for outstanding and dedicated service from organizations, including the Arkansas Municipal League, National Association of Minority Contractors, the Arkansas Police and Bar associations, among others.  His term ended in 2004 due to term limits.\n\nHaving seen Wilhelmina emerge as a leader in her own right after serving as both Basileus of Beta Pi Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and as the president of the local chapter of The Links, Inc., John Lewellen encouraged his wife Wilhelmina to run for his soon to be vacated position.  Wilhelmina reluctantly agreed though she did not have public office experience. Wilhelmina won with an overwhelming 84 percent of the vote and continued his legacy and created one of her own holding the seat until she was also term limited in 2010.\n\nJohn Lewellen is the only elected official in the State of Arkansas to serve on the City, County and State levels of government.\n\nJohn Lewellen was a life member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the NAACP, Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, and served on a number of boards and committees.

Born in Fairfield, Iowa, Lewellen was a product of the Depression-era bread lines, a pursuit he only left once he graduated from the University of Chicago's School of Economics. Drawing from his rural Midwest upbringing, he heavily reinvested in the American Midwest and underprivileged communities. Lewellen worked in banking throughout the 1950s, rising through the ranks of the Chicago Board of Trade to become the vice president in 1958. Here, he saw the potential of Chicago's industrial base, noting there was a great deal of potential for citizens to create their own wealth. During the next two decades, Lewellen continued with his banking career while philanthropically investing in the Midwest and surrounding areas. He was a patron to numerous educational programs as well as community-based social services. His portfolio expanded throughout the US, including investments in New York based multinational firms, charitable foundations, and the development of new architecture for public and low-income housing in Chicago's neighborhoods. Lewellen co-founded the Chicago Community Loan Fund, a program to assist in community development. He was a member of the Chicago Public Library Advisory Board, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, the Community Renewal Society, and served on the boards of the Chicago Transit Authority and the Chicago Urban League. Lewellen passed away in March 2021, leaving behind a legacy of hard work and dedication to under-privileged communities and greater social equity for all. He was 96 at the time of his passing. He is survived by two children, four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. The John M. Lewellen Award was established in his memory at the University of Chicago and is presented annually to a graduate student in economics who displays the same dedication to service as Lewellen. It is hoped that this recognition will encourage others to continue his work of advocating for social equity and fostering increased economic independence among the underprivileged.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 55894336}

The Tejano Music Awards were first awarded in 1981 and was established to recognize the most talented performers of Tejano music\u2014a subgenre of regional Mexican music. The nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors and disc jockeys of Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Originally, winners were chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames. By 1987, the award ceremony was broadcast through 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The awards ceremony were originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then to the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe award was first presented to Lisa Lopez for two consecutive years. Lopez was credited to have become the first female Tejano singer to have a number one single on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart in 1982.

Men's and women's singles champions were first named in 1978; the title is now also awarded for doubles, wheelchair, and junior players. It is sometimes named the \"ITF Player of the Year\" award, alluding to similar other year-end awards in tennis.\n\nRules and procedures\nThe ITF's constitution states that no tennis tournament can be designated the \"World Championships\" without unanimous consent of the ITF Council. There is currently no such tournament. The constitution also states:\nThe ITF may award the title of World Champion to players who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, are the most outstanding players in any one-year. The names of players who have been awarded this title shall be listed in the Roll of Honour.\nIt also states:\nOfficial Tennis Championships [i.e. the Grand Slam events] shall be the decisive factor in the determination of the ITF World Champions for each year.\n\nFor singles, ITF appoints a panel of former top players at the start of the season, which votes on the champion at the end of the season.\n\nThe boys' and girls' singles and doubles titles prior to 2003 were awarded based on world ranking. Since then singles and doubles rankings have been combined in a single award each for boys and for girls.\n\nThe world champion accolade has been extended by the ITF to wheelchair tennis players of the Men's and Women's division since 1991. In November 2017, the ITF announced that the quad wheelchair tennis division is to be recognised in its annual list of ITF World Champions.\n\nIn 1996, the Philippe Chatrier Award was introduced, honouring individuals or organisations who have made outstanding contributions to tennis globally, both on and off the court. The award is considered to be the ITF's highest accolade and is named after the former French tennis player Philippe Chatrier, who was President of the governing body between 1977 and 1991.\n\nThe ITF World Champions' Dinner takes place in Paris during the French Open, to honour the previous year's champions, who are presented with a trophy, but not any monetary prize.\n\nFor 2020 there were no ITF World Champion awards given due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tennis season was suspended for about 5 months for both the female and the male tennis players.\n\nMen's singles\nThe first men's panel in 1978 had three members, Don Budge, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad, who attended the season's Grand Slam events at ITF expense to inform their choice. The 1983 panel split two to one between John McEnroe (votes of Budge and Perry) and Mats Wilander (vote of Hoad). The 1984 panel had five members, while the 1985 panel had four: Budge, Perry, Hoad, and Tony Trabert. When Ivan Lendl was chosen as champion for 1985, the panel's announcement was accompanied with a rebuke for Lendl's criticism of some tournaments and his refusal to play in the Davis Cup. Perry and Trabert were on the 1986 panel, with performances outside the Grand Slams taken into consideration.\n\nThe 1990 designation of Lendl as champion was a surprise.  That year, the Association of Tennis Professionals named Stefan Edberg its \"Player of The Year\", in accordance with the ATP Rankings, while Tennis Magazine (France) ranked Edberg first, Andre Agassi second, and Lendl third. Tennis also suggested the ITF was punishing Edberg for denigrating the Grand Slam Cup tournament it had introduced. The ITF panel, of Perry, Trabert, and Frank Sedgman, called it \"the toughest decision any of us can remember having to make\", and stated it was Lendl's better average performance in the Grand Slams that made the difference.\n\nThe choice to award Djokovic the ITF World Champion of 2013 over Nadal was unexpected. Nadal finished the year ranked #1 and with more slams (2 to 1), more Masters titles (5 to 3), and more tournament titles (10 to 7).  Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title).\n\nOther instances when the ITF choices differed from the ATP rankings are 1978 (Jimmy Connors), 1982 (McEnroe), 1989 (Lendl).   None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982).\n\nWomen's singles\nThe women's panel initially featured three former women's champions, Margaret Court, Margaret duPont and Ann Jones. Althea Gibson was a member through the early 1980s.\n\nITF world champions for women differed from the WTA year-end rankings the following years: 1978 (Martina Navratilova), 1994 (Steffi Graf), 2001 (Lindsay Davenport), 2004 (Lindsay Davenport), 2005 (Lindsay Davenport), 2011 (Caroline Wozniacki), 2012 (Victoria Azarenka), 2017 (Simona Halep).\n\nDoubles\n\nBoys & Girls\n\nSingles (1978\u20132003)\n\nDoubles (1978\u20132003)\n\nWheelchair\n\nQuad's wheelchair\n\nSee also\nWorld number 1 ranked male tennis players\nWorld number 1 ranked female tennis players\nInternational Tennis Federation\nPhilippe Chatrier Award\nATP Awards\nWTA Awards\nTennis statistics\n\nReferences\nITF Constitution\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links\n \n\nHistory of tennis\nTennis awards\nLists of tennis players\nTennis records and statistics\nInternational Tennis Federation\nITF", "machine_text": " The ITF World Champions is an annual organization set up by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in order to recognize the world's best male and female tennis players.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Karl Stromberg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd J\u00fcrgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl who is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used.\n\nBiography\n\nThe webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is \"Sigmund\".\n\nScheme\nAlthough Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the \"surface world\". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are \"buried at sea\".)\n\nThis scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman.\n\nPrevention\nStromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.\n\nBond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.\n\nHenchmen\n Jaws - survived\n Naomi - blown up by Bond\n Sandor - thrown off the edge of a building by Bond\n Liparus Captain - fatally wounded by an explosion\n Professor Markowitz - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Dr. Bechmann - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Kate Chapman - eaten by shark\n Captain, Stromberg 1 (formerly Soviet submarine Potemkin) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 2\n Captain, Stromberg 2 (formerly British submarine HMS Ranger) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 1\n Motorbike Henchman - blinded and sent off a cliff\n Three Men in Jaws' car - all killed in car crash\n A small army of red soldiers\n\nSee also\nList of James Bond villains\nJames Bond in film\n\nReferences\n\nBond villains\nFictional German people\nFictional Swedish people\nJames Bond characters\nFictional businesspeople\nFictional dictators\nFictional warlords\nThe Spy Who Loved Me (film)\nFilm characters introduced in 1977\nFictional terrorists\nMale literary villains\nMale film villains\nAction film villains\nFilm supervillains", "machine_text": " Karl Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist featured in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. He was portrayed by big name actor Curd J\u00fcrgens and was the main villain Bond had to face in the film as he sought out to find the mysterious missing submarines. Stromberg was a wealthy, eccentric and ruthless industrial magnate who owned a large conglomerate called Stromberg Industries. He was a recluse, rarely seen in public and having lavish parties and business meetings held on board his luxury mega-yacht, the Liparus. Being a powerful and influential figure of the world, Stromberg had a deep-seated megalomaniacal desire to rid the Earth's surface of most of its population, plunging it into the new era of \"The Age of Aquarius\", symbolized by the ancient pyramid he had onboard his craft. In order to achieve his plans, Stromberg had stolen the nuclear submarines USS Ranger and HMS St George from Britain and the Soviet Union respectively and plans to use them to launch a nuclear war between the two superpowers. Ironically, after the submarines' launch codes was stolen by the nefarious Karl-Liebkind Stromberg's agent, his plan was foiled when his robot submarines were both destroyed by the joint forces of the British and Soviet navies. After having been discovered by Bond, Stromberg makes his escape and nearly succeeds in wiping out everybody onboard his craft when Bond obliges him to press the self-destruct button while Stromberg was being attacked by Bond, with the assistance of his companion Anya Amasova. Bond and Anya managed to escape and Stromberg is assumed to be killed off in the explosion. Karl Stromberg, while often seen as three-dimensional and camp as many of his other counterparts, made one of the better Bond villains thanks to the portrayal of him by J\u00fcrgens.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"GG Tauri\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "GG Tauri, often abbreviated as GG Tau, is a quintuple star system in the constellation Taurus. At a distance of about 450 light years (140 parsecs) away, it is located within the Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region. The system comprises three stars orbiting each other in a hierarchical triple system, known as GG Tauri A, and another binary star system more distant from the central system, known as GG Tauri B.\n\nThe system is unusual because it contains two distinct circumstellar disks: one surrounding the entirety of GG Tauri A, and another surrounding the brightest star of GG Tauri A. Its large size and close distance make it ideal to study how exoplanets form within multiple star systems.\n\nProperties\nGG Tauri consists of five stars, which are T Tauri stars \u2013 a class of variable stars that show irregular changes in brightness. These stars are extremely young and more luminous than their main sequence counterparts, because they have not condensed into the normal size yet. The four components of GG Tauri stars are relatively cool K-type or M-type stars, with these spectral types: K7 for GG Tauri Aa, M0.5 for GG Tauri Ab, M5 for GG Tauri Ba, and M7 for GG Tauri Bb; the age of the system is estimated to be 1.5 million years.\n\nA dynamical study of the system found the masses of the four components to be:  for GG Tauri Aa,  for GG Tauri Ab,  for GG Tauri Ba, and  for GG Tauri Bb. At , GG Tauri Bb has a substellar mass and is a brown dwarf. Orbital motion has been detected in the central system (Aa and Ab), but not in the outer pair Ba and Bb (as its orbital period is too long).\n\nA preliminary orbit for GG Tauri Aa and Ab has been calculated, but is not very well constrained. The orbit is moderately eccentric; Some studies have determined that their orbit has a semimajor axis of about 34 au and is misaligned to the circumbinary disk by about 25 degrees. However, other studies have found the orbit to be coplanar to the circumbinary disk, with a larger semimajor axis of about 60 au.\n\nInterferometric techniques have been used to observe GG Tauri Ab, the lower-mass component of the central system. GG Tauri Ab was found to be a binary star system comprising two red dwarfs (Ab1 = M2V, Ab2 = M3V), with a separation of about 4.5 AU. Its orbital period is currently estimated to be around 16 years. This would explain why the GG Tauri Ab's spectrum suggests an unusually low-mass star instead of the higher mass that was measured.\n\nBecause of interactions with GG Tauri A, the outer pair GG Tauri Ba and Bb are not very stable. The internal orbit of GG Tauri Ba and Bb must be retrograde relative to its whole orbit around GG Tauri A, in order to be stable.\n\nCircumstellar disks\n\nT Tauri stars are usually surrounded by circumstellar disks of gas and dust. These disks coalesce into protoplanets and then into planets.\n\nThe subsystem GG Tauri A has a large, circumbinary (technically circumtrinary) disk. Within the disk, GG Tauri Aa also has a disk, and furthermore, at least one of the Ab stars must have a disk as well. The latter is inferred from the presence of a \"gap\" in the largest disk, detected at the three-o'clock position, at a position angle of about 268\u00b0. First seen in 2002, it is interpreted as a shadow because it does not rotate with the disk. Interstellar material blocks the light from part of the disk, causing this shadow. The Aa and Ab rings are coplanar to each other.\n\nThe disk around GG Tauri Aa has a mass of about , or about the mass of Jupiter, at a temperature of about 20 to 30 K. GG Tauri Aa appears to have a jet coming out from the poles, as evidenced by forbidden Fe II lines.\n\nMass is currently accreting from the inner disks into the stars themselves. Because the disks have not been consumed yet, the larger, circumbinary disk must be supplying mass into the smaller disks. Several lines of evidence point to this. Firstly, a search for diatomic hydrogen gas (H2) could be found up to 100 AU away from the center of the system, but significant emission was also detected 30 au away. This emission was detected where a previous survey found gas streaming from the outer disk to the inner disk, so it was assumed that the emission resulted from mass falling from the inner disk to the outer disk. Observations taken in 2014 showed similar results. Secondly, near-infrared polarimetry of the area showed the same structure connecting the inner and outer disks. The stars of GG Tauri A are closer to the ring on the northern side (where the streamer is) than the southern side. Finally, although there is not much gas falling into the inner disks, the accretion rate of gas has been measured to be ~ yr\u22121 which is at least the rate of accretion from the inner disks to the stars themselves. Therefore, the outer disk provides enough mass to replenish the inner disks.\n\nPossible protoplanets\nAt the edge of the outer disk, there is a \"hot spot\" with additional gas, and at a higher temperature of about 40 K. There are also spiral-shaped formations within the disk. At the center of this \"hot spot\" may be a protoplanet termed GG Tauri Ac, which is still accreting mass. This would explain the higher gas density and temperature, as well as the spiral formations. If it exists, it would likely be about the mass of Neptune or smaller, given that it has not cleared out a gap at its location. Other planets could explain other spiral features within the disk.\n\nChemistry\nThe chemistry of circumstellar disks is important for understanding planetary formation. The inner disk, like other protoplanetary disks, is rich in simple molecules containing elements such as carbon and sulfur. In 2018, hydrogen sulfide () was reported, and in 2021, thioxoethenylidene (CCS) was reported to exist within the disk. Both are the first instances of those species known in a protoplanetary disk. The chemical mechanisms related to their formation are not very well understood.\n\nSee also\nHL Tauri, a T Tauri star with a protoplanetary disk\nBD\u221222 5866, a quadruple star system with relatively low mass\nTaurus (Chinese astronomy)\n\nReferences\n\nTauri, GG\nTaurus (constellation)\nT Tauri stars\nK-type main-sequence stars\nM-type main-sequence stars\nCircumstellar disks\n5", "machine_text": " GG Tauri is a binary star system located in the Taurus Constellation, approximately 440 light-years away from Earth. The primary component, GG Tauri A, is a pre-main sequence star classified as a T Tauri type star located roughly 20 arc seconds southwest of the secondary component, GG Tauri B. GG Tauri A has a calculated mass of 11-14 times that of our sun and is estimated to be as young as 1 to 4 million years. It is one of the most studied young stars and is of particular interest due to its location near the planetary nebula NGC 1514. GG Tauri's binary companion, GG Tauri B, is significantly less luminous and has a calculated mass of only 1.5-8 times greater than the sun. The two stars are separated by a projected distance of about 441 astronomical units (1AU= Earth-Sun distance). GG Tauri A is estimated to have a temperature of 4500 K, a luminoisty of 60-175 times that of the sun, and an accretion rate onto the protoplanetary disk at about 10-4 solar masses per year. The temperature and luminosity of the primary component have been found to vary over time, suggesting that the disk is not in a steady-state configuration. The two stars in the GG Tauri system are believed to produce a protoplanetary disk around the primary component. This disk is estimated to be between 500-1000AU in diameter and is currently being fed by outflows from both stars. Observations of the disk with the Subaru Telescope in 2016 and 2017 revealed several features of interest. These features included the presence of concentric gap structures, spiral arms, and a flattened structure in the outer region of the disk. The two GG Tauri stars are believed to be in the process of forming their own planetary system and their binary relationship is likely to affect the formation and evolution of these planets. Additional observations of the GG Tauri system can help us to better understand early star formation and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 53159659}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Luke Rhinehart\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George Powers Cockcroft (November 15, 1932 \u2013 November 6, 2020), widely known by the pen name Luke Rhinehart, was an American novelist, screenwriter, and nonfiction writer with at least ten books to his name. He is best known for his 1971 novel The Dice Man, the story of a psychiatrist who experiments with making life decisions based on the roll of a die.\n\nThe Dice Man was critically well received and a commercial success. It quickly became and remains a cult classic.It was followed by two spiritual sequels in Adventures of Wim (1986) and The Search for the Dice Man (1993) as well as a companion volume called The Book of the Die (2000). Rhinehart wrote several other novels between 1986 and 2006 though none achieved the success of The Dice Man.\n\nEarly life\nGeorge Powers Cockcroft was born on November 15, 1932 in Albany, New York to Donald and Elizabeth Cockcroft, both college graduates, his mother from Wellesley College. He was raised in Albany, where his father was an electrical engineer, and his ancestry included Vermont political notables. He attended The Albany Academy, graduating in 1950, and received a BA from Cornell University in 1954 and an MA from Columbia University in 1956. In 1964 he received a PhD in American literature, also from Columbia. After obtaining his PhD, he went into teaching. During his years as a university professor he taught, among other things, courses in Zen and Western literature.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1969, while Cockcroft was teaching a study abroad program on the island of Mallorca, an Englishman starting a new publishing house happened to stop at a cafe in the same village, Dei\u00e0, and was given a partial manuscript of The Dice Man to read by Cockcroft. Cockcroft was subsequently offered an advance payment for publication. Shortly afterwards, Cockcroft was encouraged by his course Director to take an early sabbatical from his teaching duties. He remained in Mallorca to complete the novel, after which the publisher sold the American rights to the novel for a large sum, and within a year the film rights, allowing Cockcroft to retire from teaching and become a full time novelist.\n\nPersonal life and family\n\nCockroft married his wife, Ann, who would later become a writer of two romance novels and a volume of poetry, on June 30, 1956; together they have three children. His brother, James Cockcroft, is the author of more than 20 books, mostly on Latin American history and society.\n\nThe author and his family spent a number of years traveling, sailing, and returning to Mallorca, living in Dei\u00e0 in the late 1960s and early 70s, including time spent on a large catamaran which became the inspiration for the boat in his novel Long Voyage Back. In the mid 1970s they returned to the United States and spent 1975 in a sufi commune, before moving to a large old farmhouse and former religious retreat in the foothills of the Berkshires in upstate New York.\n\nDeath\n\nOn 1 August 2012, the \"death\" of Rhinehart at the age of 79 was announced by email to 25 friends, beginning with the words \u201cIt is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead\u201d; it was later revealed the \u201cDeath Letter\u201d was instigated as a playful hoax by Cockcroft. Reactions ranged from sorrow to gratitude and amusement.\n\nCockroft died in November 2020.\n\nThe Dice Man\n\nCockcroft has described the origin of the idea for this work variously, however, at the time of the publication of this work, \"it was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography\", all the more because its protagonist and author were eponymous, both were described as having the same profession (psychiatry), and elements of the described lives of both (e.g., places of residence, date of birth) were also in common; hence, curiosity over its authorship have persisted since its publication. Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, writing for The Guardian, presented a long-form expose on Cockcroft and the relationship between author and legend in 2019, and in following others, established the author Cockcroft as a life-long English professor living \"in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond\", a husband of fifty-years, father of three, and a caregiver to a special needs child.\n\nThe Dice Man was critically well received. It quickly became, and remains thought of as a cult classic. It initially sold poorly in the United States, but well in Europe, particularly England, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Writing in 2017 for The Guardian, Tanya Gold noted that \"over the course of 45 years\" it was still in print, had become famous, had devoted fans, and had \"sold more than 2m copies in multiple languages\" (e.g., as many as 27 languages and 60 countries have been claimed). In 1995, the BBC called it \"one of the fifty most influential books of the last half of the twentieth century,\" and in 1999, after one of their reporters experimented, controversially, with dicing, Loaded magazine named it \"Novel of the Century\". In 2013, Alex Clark of the Telegraph chose it as one of the fifty greatest cult books of the last hundred years.\n\nBooks After The Dice Man\n\nComic philosophical novels\nA number of works authored by him have a similar style to The Dice Man and alternate between first- and third-person voice with selections from fictional documents.  In one case, he even quotes from a future book that he did not actually write until more than two decades later. The voices having different characteristics, the novel's mood changes accordingly.\n\nPresenting these multiple fragments from multiple viewpoints together resulted in a \"cubist\" narrative structure.\u00a0Of this, Rhinehart stated hat they had \u201c always conceived of myself as being multiple \u2013 having, you know, a dozen different selves, if not a thousand different selves, at any given moment.\u201d\n\nAdventures of Wim was an effort to create a new interpretation of the story of Wim, a Montauk boy born of a virgin mother, declared the savior of the Montauk nation, and his life quest for Ultimate Truth. The book is told through the medium of fictional documents.\n\nThe Search for the Dice Man (1993), set twenty years later, tells the story of Rhinehart's son, Larry, who has built a highly successful and stable life, having rejected his father's embracing of Chance.\u00a0 On a quest to find his father however, Larry's life of order and routine becomes enveloped in chaos, the legacy of his father's work.\n\nFrom a draft written at the same time as The Dice Man, Naked Before the World (2008) celebrates the lives of both hippies and the establishment in 1960s Mallorca through the story of Katya, an innocent Catholic art student who arrives on the island to study abroad. Katya is thrown into a world of artists, frauds, sex, drugs and the struggle to discover who she wants to be.\n\nIn Jesus Invades George: An Alternative History (2013), which takes place in 2007, then-sitting President George W. Bush is possessed by the spirit of Jesus Christ. The story playfully reveals and deconstructs the hypocrisy of government and modern politics.\n\nIn Invasion (2016), aliens invade Earth for the sole purpose of having fun. Hyper-intelligent and able to morph into multiple forms, they play games with culture and infrastructure, from computer networks and social media to corporate culture and human relationships. The resulting mayhem reveals the primitive nature of our society, and offers an alternative vision for the human race. A sequel is to be published entitled The Hairy Balls and the End of Civilization.\n\nConventional novels\nIn Matari (1975)\u00a0 (republished as White Wind, Black Rider (2008)) is historical fiction set in 18th Century Japan, the beautiful Matari is joined by two zen poets as she flees from her husband, a samurai lord who is giving chase with intent to murder her. A lyrical and poetic tale of love, honor and morality.\n\nLong Voyage Back (1983), a nautical action-adventure novel, follows a group of people sailing aboard a trimaran, and their struggle for survival as they escape the aftermath of nuclear war.\n\nNonfiction\nThe Book of est (1976) is a narrative account of Werner Erhard's controversial LGAT course  personal transformation course known as Erhard Seminar Training or est, which began in 1971. (Erhard insisted on using lower case letters for the acronym.) The reader is put in the place of a participant, in order to vicariously \"experience\" the training. Erhard authored a foreword to the book.\n\nThe Book of the Die (2000) is \u201chandbook of dice living\u201d intended to help free readers from barriers to an unfulfilled life. It follows the philosophy that people must give up their illusion that a self can control life; they must let go.\u00a0 A collection of proverbs, essays, cartoons, poems, scenes from movies and more form this guide to creating a more playful and unpredictable life.\n\nOther works\n\nScreenplays\nThough best known as a novelist, Rhinehart has also written nine screenplays: five are based directly on his novels: The Dice Man, The Search for the Dice Man, Whim, Naked Before the World, and White Wind, Black Rider. Two others are direct Dice Man sequels featuring the original character: The Dice Lady (co-written with Peter Forbes), and Last Roll of the Die (co-written with Nick Mead). Two other screenplays, Mawson and Picton's Chance, are original concepts.\n\nAudio\nThe music and spoken word album, The Dice Man Speaks, on Dice Man Records, a new imprint of bizbro CREATIVE, features the pseudonymous Rhinehart and Sputnik Weazel and was released in 2018.\u00a0 On it, Cockcroft/Rhinehart performs spoken word passages voiced over acoustic and electronic musical pieces by Weazel.\n\nAntecedents and influence\nTo date there appears to be a single published scholarly work on the ideas appearing in Cockcroft's The Dice Man, a conference paper from Shanna Robinson of the Institute for Culture and Society at the University of Western Sydney in Australia; in addressing the popular accounts of Dickson on its having the \"impact of religious conversion on millions\" and the suggestion, again in popular media (by Dickson and Adams), that the dicing theme was, at that time, \"enjoying a renaissance\", Robinson writes:Although acknowledged that there has been no research at this point establishing the veracity of this, a number of other manifestations of dicing lend some credibility to the idea that it enjoys a certain level of popularity.\n\nAlso, the starting point for David Colton's 2019 PhD thesis, \u2033Canned Chance, The commodification of aleatory art practice\u2033 is the Dice Man novel. The novel, and the use of dice and other tools for accessing chance are discussed here. See Manchester Metropolitan University, http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/view/creators/Colton=3ADavid,_G=3A=3A.html\n\nMore generally, art exploring the application of chance or randomness in its expression is referred to as aleatoricism, and at least one academic, Richard Hoadley, a faculty member in Music and Performing Arts at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, refers to the writings of Cockcroft/Rhinehart in their teaching on aleatoricism in art.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nMusic\nA 1979 song by The Fall called \"Dice Man\" takes its title and general concept from the book.\n\nThe Talk Talk song, \"Such A Shame\", was inspired by The Dice Man.\n\nThe At The Gates song, \"World of Lies\", quotes The Dice Man during its spoken word lyrics.\n\nTelevision and radio\nFour seasons of a television travel series called The Diceman were made between 1998 and 2000 by the Discovery Channel. The destinations and activities of the participants were determined by the roll of a die.\n\nUK Channel 4's broadcast of Diceworld (1999, Paul Wilmshurst directing), a 50-minute television documentary about Cockcroft/Rhinehart and some of the people influenced by his novels, led to a resurgence of interest in Cockcroft/Rhinehart's books, and in various related \"dicing projects\". A further documentary was produced in 2004, a collaboration between Cockcroft/Rhinehart and director Nick Mead, entitled Dice Life: The Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart.\n\nTheater\nInspired by The Dice Man and written by Paul Lucas, the play The Dice House premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001, and went on to staging at the Arts Theatre in London's West End in 2004.\n\nMagazines and books\nControversially, journalist Ben Marshall spent two years from 1998 to 2000 experimenting with dicing, and reporting his experiences in Loaded magazine; Loaded subsequently named Cockcroft/Rhinehart as novelist of the century.\n\nMurder mystery author Terry Mitchell often uses characters who throw dice to make decisions, and in his own personal life, Mitchell created the \"dice road trip\", \"dicing to eat\", and \"The Sacred Journey\", each of which used dice to make decisions about life decisions.\n\nComics and related media\nThe UK comic, 2000 AD, published the Gamebook magazine title, Dice Man, in 1986; in total 5 editions were created by Pat Mills through October of that year, with script and game by Mills, covers by Glenn Fabry, and with art and lettering done by various individuals at 2000 AD. The relationship between this comic title and the similarly titled Cockcroft work has been established.\n\nAdvertising\nThe brewers of Rolling Rock beer launched an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom in 1998 based on The Dice Man theme, a campaign that included a short-lived Dice Life website. The relationship between this campaign and Cockcroft's work has been established.\n\nArt\nSan Francisco artist Larnie Fox created War Toys, \"an exhibit of kinetic sound sculptures\", for which an activity, \"The Dicewalk\", inspired by Cockcroft's work, was part of its closing ceremony.\n\nBibliography\n\n The Dice Man (1971).\n Matari (1975).\n The Book of est (1976).\n Long Voyage Back (1983).\n Adventures of Wim (1986).\n The Search for the Dice Man (1993).\n The Book of the Die (2000).\n Whim (2002 reissue of Adventures of Wim).\n White Wind, Black Rider (2008).

He is best known for writing the 1971 novel The Dice Man, which has been translated into more than 20 languages. He is also the author of several other novels, including The Search for the Dice Man and Whim, as well as a volume of essays called A Search for Meaning and several nonfiction books. Rhinehart graduated from Cornell University with a degree in psychology and later earned a doctorate in the same field from the University of California, Berkeley. He practiced psychology in various settings including prisons and schools, as well as in private consultation. He eventually became dissatisfied with traditional psychological techniques and theories and left the field in the late 1960s. Throughout his career as a writer and thinker, Rhinehart has rejected traditional approaches to life and decision-making in favor of something he calls \"The Lifestyle of Chance\", in which decisions are made randomly with the help of a dice. He argues that, by stepping away from pre-ordained choices, people can more fully experience life and find joy and fulfillment. Rhinehart and his theories have been the subject of several novels, films and television series and he has become a figure in popular culture. Rhinehart's work has been controversial, particularly with some religious and moral groups. His philosophy is seen by some as an attempt to provide a framework to deal with the lack of absolutes and the seemingly random nature of life. To others, it is seen as a risk to established morality and fulfillment of personal desires over and above societal values. Rhinehart has also written on a variety of topics unrelated to his dice philosophy, from sexuality and relationships to Zen and Taoism. He is a multi-media artist and continues to write and lecture around the world. His work has been translated into more than 20 languages, and he has been described as \"an apostle of possibility and pleasure, a champion of adventure and risk-taking\". Today, Rhinehart lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, and remains an influential, though controversial, figure in modern literature and philosophy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 159533}

The instrument's name derives from \"d\u012b,\" meaning \"low,\" and \"h\u00fa\" (short for huqin).\n\nSizes\nThe instrument comes in three sizes:\nThe xiaodihu (\u5c0f\u4f4e\u80e1, also called dahu or cizhonghu), pitched one octave below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the viola's lowest C). It is the tenor member of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member).\nThe zhongdihu (\u4e2d\u4f4e\u80e1, pitched one octave below the zhonghu, (tuned G-D, as the middle strings of the cello). It is the bass member of the erhu family.\nThe dadihu (\u5927\u4f4e\u80e1, pitched one octave below the xiaodihu and two octaves below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the cello's lowest C). It is the contrabass member of the erhu family.\n\nOverview\nThe dihu family was developed for orchestral use in the 1930s as lower members of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member) to increase the pitch range of the instruments used in a Chinese orchestra and allow music with harmony to be played.  However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.\n\nSee also\nDahu (instrument)\nDiyingehu\nLaruan\nHuqin\nTraditional Chinese musical instruments\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDihu page (Chinese)\nXiaodihu photo (xiaodihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nZhongdihu photo (zhongdihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nDadihu photo (dadihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\n\nBowed instruments\nChinese musical instruments\nDrumhead lutes\nHuqin family instruments", "machine_text": " Dihu (Chinese: \u6ef4\u6e56; pinyin: d\u012b h\u00fa) is a town in Yunnan Province, Southwest China.

As of 2010, it had an estimated population of 3697, an increase on the 2001 census figure of 2714, and a decrease from ca. 1904 when its population was approximately 6,000.\n\nHistory\n\nPadilla was established on June 23, 1583. Along with Tomina, Padilla was originally established as a fort against eastern Indian warriors, the Chiriguanos (Guaran\u00ed). Captain Don Miguel Martinez established the town in 1583 under the name of San Miguel de La Laguna. After it was destroyed by the Chiriguanos, the town was re-established by the Spanish Captain Melchor de Rodas who renamed it San Juan de Rodas.  However, it soon reverted to La Laguna. It then played a strategic role containing invasions by the indigenous chiriguanas.  The town eventually became the seat of the military, civil authority and ecclesiastical leadership, becoming the capital of the Tomina Province.\n\nIn 1809, it became the headquarters of the guerrilla chief Manuel Ascencio Padilla (died 1816, El Villar), husband of Juana Azurduy de Padilla who shared his love of the Bolivian indigenous populations. By 1827, it was renamed Padilla in honor of the province's patriot. During the period of 1882 to 1888, Padilla's judicial archives contained 211 cases of cattle rustling and five armed attacks.  By 1905, the crime rate had risen to 296 cases of cattle rustling and 28 armed attacks.  Between 1910 and 1930, a steep rise in the crime rate occurred.

The annual rainfall is about 650\u00a0mm, with a pronounced dry season from May to August.\n\nEconomy\n\nPadilla lies in one of the poorest regions of Bolivia, with few natural resources and lacking social and economic conditions.  The municipality of Padilla has an economy which is based around traditional agriculture such as the production of corn, potatoes, beans, wheat, yuca, cassava, yams, peppers, and amaranth. It is especially noted for its quality red Chili peppers and annually enters into the International Red Chili Pepper Festival. The people of Padilla rear goats.\n\nCulture\nThe town of Padilla is populated by a mostly mestizo population, many of which are descendants from Spaniard families who intermingled with Quechuas from nearby settlements to the West.

The twenty-two songs selected to compete in the competition were announced on 20 January 2005.\n\nAmong the selected competing artists was former Maltese Eurovision entrant Chiara who represented Malta in the 1998 contest, and Fabrizio Faniello who represented Malta in the 2001 contest. Among the songwriters, Paul Abela, Gerard James Borg and Philip Vella were all past writers of Maltese Eurovision entries. Paul Giordimaina represented Malta in the 1991 edition with Georgina Abela, who co-wrote the Maltese entry in 2001. Ralph Siegel and John O'Flynn co-wrote seventeen entries for various countries. On 19 January 2005, \"Once Again\", written by Paul Abela and Georgina Abela and to have been performed by Fabrizio Faniello, and \"Sail Away\", written by Marc Paelinck who co-wrote the Belgian entries in 2002 and 2004 and to have been performed by Chiara, were withdrawn from the competition and replaced with the songs \"There for You\" performed by Leontine and Roger, and \"The Angels Are Tired\" performed by Manuel due to both singers having been selected with two songs each.\n\nFinal \nThe final took place on 19 February 2005. Twenty-two entries competed and the winner was determined solely by a public televote. The show was opened with a guest performance of \"On Again... Off Again\" performed by the 2004 Maltese Eurovision entrant Julie and Ludwig, while the interval act featured performances by the 1996, 2002 and 2005 Cypriot Eurovision entrant Constantinos Christoforou performing \"Ela Ela\", the 2004 Maltese Junior Eurovision entrant Young Talent Team, the Central Academy of Ballet, and the local act Corkskrew. After the results of the public televote were announced, \"Angel\" performed by Chiara was the winner.\n\nControversy \nDuring Malta Song for Europe 2005, it was revealed that there had been issues calculating the final result as one of the three phone operators failed to turn over their results in time and therefore the show was delayed. A complaint was also submitted by the Maltese Composers and Singers Union (UKAM) due to an electricity breakdown occurring in several cities in Malta which caused affected viewers to only be able to see the final six performances (five of the six songs were placed in the top ten, including the eventual winner, Chiara).\n\nAt Eurovision\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2005 took place at the Palace of Sports in Kyiv, Ukraine and consisted of a semi-final on 19 May and the final of 21 May 2005. According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country, the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) and the ten highest placed finishers in the 2005 contest are required to qualify from the semi-final in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from the semi-final progress to the final. As one the ten highest placed finishers in the 2004 contest, Malta automatically qualified to compete in the final. In addition to their participation in the final, Malta is also required to broadcast and vote in the semi-final. On 22 March 2005, a special allocation draw was held which determined the running order and Malta was set to perform in position 3 during the final, following the entry from United Kingdom and before the entry from Romania. Malta placed second in the final, scoring 192 points.\n\nThe semi-final and the final were broadcast in Malta on TVM with commentary by Eileen Montesin. The Maltese spokesperson, who announced the Maltese votes during the final, was Moira Delia.\n\nVoting \nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to Malta and awarded by Malta in the semi-final and grand final of the contest.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screen direction\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In film editing, video editing and post production, screen direction is the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on the screen from the point of view of the camera or audience. A rule of film editing and film grammar is that movement from one edited shot to another must maintain the consistency of screen direction in order to avoid audience confusion.\n\n\"Camera left\" or \"frame left\" indicates movement towards the left side of the screen, while \"camera right\" or \"frame right\" refers to movement towards the right side of the screen.  \"Foreground\" refers to the apparent space close to the camera (and thus to the audience), and \"background\" refers to the apparent space in the distance away from the camera and the audience.\n\nAs an example of screen direction in use, if an actor is shown in one shot walking from screen left to screen right and then is shown in the next shot to be moving in the opposite direction (screen right to screen left), the audience will assume that the actor has changed direction and is walking back to where he started (in the absence of obvious contextual or environmental cues).\n\nIf the shot shows him again moving from screen left to screen right (as in the first shot), the audience will assume that the actor is continuing his previous movement and extending it to apparently cover a greater distance even if that is purely a fabrication of editing.\n\nAnother example would be if two characters are shown in a medium shot, say from the waist up, looking at each other, it is generally established that one is on the left of screen and the other on the right. The one on the left looks right to the other character and vice versa. When the editor cuts to a close shot of a person, it would be disorienting if the character looked the other way. The audience would assume that the character is looking at something else.\n\nIn the coverage of the scene, it is customary in film technique to be sure that screen direction is maintained. In a close up, the environmental cues are at a minimum.  \n\nIt is the responsibility of the director, cameraman, and script supervisor on the set to maintain consistency of screen direction so that later during editing, the myriad short pieces of film can be properly assembled by the editor into a coherent film that tells the story intended.\n\nAvant-garde, experimental, and some independent film and video productions often deliberately violate screen direction rules in order to create audience disorientation or ambiguity. However, unless it is done very skillfully, violation of screen direction can appear to the audience to be the result of filmmaker ineptitude rather than experimentation.\n\nCinematic techniques", "machine_text": " Screen direction is an essential component of film and television production. It is the process of establishing the position, size, and movement of actors and props on the screen in order to create the desired visual effects. Properly executed screen direction helps to maintain the flow, drama, and tension of a scene. It also helps ensure clarity and cohesion in the viewing experience by effectively utilizing available camera angles, depth of field, and other visual effects. Screen direction is traditionally established by the director, who must consider a wide range of factors, such as the screenplay, the project\u2019s budget, and the availability of location and set-up time. The director must also maintain creative control over the action and movement of characters while effectively guiding the gaze of the audience in the desired direction. Typically, screen direction begins with a specific set of direction words. These words effectively communicate the director\u2019s desired vision to the actors and crew. Commonly used direction words may include wide shot, close-up, over-the-shoulder (OTS), or zoom in. Additionally, a director may provide further instruction regarding blocking, staging, and camera angles. Screen direction is also heavily influenced by editing. In order to create the desired visual flow, the editing of scenes must be carefully considered. An editor will typically work with the director to execute the desired action and movement of each shot in order to create suspense, maintain smooth transitions, and emphasize key plot points. Additionally, it is possible to use software-based tools for live video production and streaming with automated camera switching and virtual directors. With these tools, a virtual director will handle the task of selecting the best shots and orienting the camera according to the desired action. This can be especially useful for online streaming events or streaming TV shows. In conclusion, screen direction is an essential component of film and television production. It helps to create the desired visual effects and maintain the tension and drama of the scene. Screen direction is established by the director and usually consists of a set of direction words, blocking, and camera angles. Additionally, it is heavily influenced by editing in order to achieve the desired flow of action.

For a decade after his MBA, Reynolds worked in industry before starting his own firm, Injection Molders Supply Company in 1949.\n\nReese Morse was the daughter of Cleveland pharmaceuticals manufacturer George Reese. After graduating from the Hathaway Brown School, she earned a bachelor's degree in music from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida in 1937. She was initiated into the Florida Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi chapter at Rollins College.\n\nOccupational life\nReynolds Morse had many business, writing and collecting interests in addition to the collection of Salvador Dal\u00ed's paintings which he and Reese Morse built up and to running Injection Molders Supply Company. For instance, he published \"Injection Molding News\"; added to the rock collection of the Denver Natural History Museum where he was a trustee, and he collected George Elbert Burr manuscript materials which he donated to the Denver Public Library.\n\nReynolds Morse also authored George Elbert Burr: Etcher of the American West and published an anthology of his own, which he called Some Fifty Unprofessional Poems, as well as Gold Links Tailings in memory of his maternal grandfather. Reynolds Morse collected and wrote about the works of M. P. Shiel. Reynolds' The Works of M. P. Shiel was published in 1948; he later turned this work into a four-tome set and added The Quest for Redonda and The New King. In 1989 Reynolds donated his Shiel collection to Olin Library at Rollins College.\n\nThe Morses' diligent collecting and their friendship with Gala and Salvador Dal\u00ed produced a valuable art collection that is now housed in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum is said to be the world's most comprehensive collection of Dal\u00ed's works.\n\nThe year of their marriage the Morses began their long friendship with Dal\u00ed and on March 21, 1943, acquired their first Dal\u00ed work, Daddy Longlegs of the Evening - Hope!; early in April 1943 they acquired The Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's \"Angelus\". Over time, becoming patrons of Dal\u00ed, the Morses acquired works by Dal\u00ed which they found both captivating and intriguing. Their absorption by the artist's work led Reynolds to author numerous studies of Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre and Eleanor to translate from French to English numerous books about Dal\u00ed and his \u0153uvre. In 1969, the Morses purchased The Hallucinogenic Toreador, before it was completed.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, the Morses' considerable Dal\u00ed collection was on show in Beachwood, Ohio at the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, which was established there in a wing of their business premises. During that time the collection grew and required larger accommodation.\n\nThe Morses began the search for a new, permanent home for their collection. After seeing an article in the Wall Street Journal, \"U.S. Art World Dillydallies over Dal\u00ed\", St. Petersburg attorney James W. Martin persuaded local leaders to approach the Morses to choose St. Petersburg. With the financial support of the City of St. Petersburg and the State of Florida, the collection was housed in the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum, formerly a warehouse on the waterfront, which opened in March 1982. A new, larger and more storm-secure museum near the current one, opened in 1-11-11 (at 11:11 am). \n\"Sharing their knowledge and understanding of Salvador Dal\u00ed and his art has been a lifelong mission for this dedicated couple.\"\n\nPersonal life\nThe Morses married in 1943. They had one son, Brad.\n\nReynolds Morse died on August 15, 2000, in Seminole, Florida, after a long illness. He was 85.\n\nReese Morse died on July 1, 2010, in St. Petersburg, Florida, of natural causes. She was 97.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum website\n Smithsonian Archives of American Art referring to Mr Morse's Journals, 1956\u20131973, in which (amongst other topics) the subject of lending art works, the carelessness of the museums, and insurance issues are discussed.\n Olin Library, Florida The A.

Reynolds, born in 1919 in Cleveland, Ohio, studied mechanical engineering at Duke University and later co-founded a manufacturing company. He created his own company, Uniroyal-Morse, in 1965. He and Eleanor Morse were known for the art collection they started assembling in the 1960s, investing heavily in the work of American and European modernist painters. This collection would eventually become one of the preeminent modern art collections of the United States, comprising a large selection of works from Calder and Picasso to Pollock and Warhol. Reynolds Morse was particularly devoted to collecting the works of surrealist Salvador Dali, having more than 30 of them in his collection, including the large-scale \"Couple with Clouds at the Bottom of the Sea,\" a 23-foot-long, floor-to-ceiling painting of a standing couple in the sea. In 1998, with the vision of creating an international destination to showcase their art, the Morses established an art museum in downtown Cleveland. The Cleveland Museum of Art, opened in 2002 and designed by well-known architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, sits on a five-acre site that spans East Boulevard to Euclid Avenue and provides an extensive view of Lake Erie. The Morses donated their personal art collection to the museum, in addition to helping to fund its construction. In recognition for their philanthropy, the museum was named the \"Reynolds and Eleanor Morse Building.\" Together, the Morses gave back to their community in philanthropic endeavors during a lifetime of service. In the years that followed, the Morses made further donations to the museum as well as to the Cleveland Institute of Art, the University of Akron, and other local organizations. Reynolds Morse passed away in 2000; his wife, Eleanor, passed away in 2013. The art museum that the Morses built and funded has since become one of the most popular destinations in Cleveland, known and appreciated internationally. In 2016, the museum announced that it surpassed the $2 billion mark in the estimated value of its extensive art collection, making it one of the top-valued art collections in the world. The Morses' passion for collecting helped to expand the Cleveland Museum of Art's reputation globally, and the Morses' combined gifts have impacted many lives, making them a shining example of philanthropy.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10033204}

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier. They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.\n\nThis list encompasses the major honours won by Manchester United and records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Manchester United players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. The club's attendance records, both at Old Trafford, their home since 1910, and Maine Road, their temporary home from 1946 to 1949, are also included in the list.\n\nThe club currently holds the record for the most Premier League titles with 13, and the highest number of English top-flight titles with 20. The club's record appearance maker is Ryan Giggs, who made 963 appearances between 1991 and 2014, and the club's record goalscorer is Wayne Rooney, who scored 253 goals in 559 appearances between 2004 and 2017.\n\nAll stats accurate as of match played 24 October 2021.\n\nHonours\n\nManchester United's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. Their first national senior honour came in 1908, when they won the 1907\u201308 Football League First Division title. The club also won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. In terms of the number of trophies won, the 1990s was Manchester United's most successful decade, during which they won five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Community Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\n\nThe club currently holds the record for most top-division titles, with 20. They were also the first team to win the Premier League, as well as holding the record for the most Premier League titles (13), and became the first English team to win the European Cup when they won it in 1968.

The signing of Anthony Martial for \u00a336\u00a0million in 2015 set a world record for the transfer of a teenager, and the \u00a380\u00a0million paid for Harry Maguire in 2019 was a world record for a defender.\n\nProgression of record fee paid\n\nThe first transfer for which Manchester United (then Newton Heath) had to pay a fee was the transfer of Gilbert Godsmark from Ashford in January 1900, paying \u00a340 for the forward.} The club's first \u00a31,000 transfer came in 1910, when they signed Leslie Hofton from Glossop. When the club signed Tommy Taylor from Barnsley in 1953, the fee was intended to be \u00a330,000. However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"\u00a330,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by \u00a31 to \u00a329,999. Busby then took the extra pound from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.\n\nManchester United made their first six-figure signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for \u00a3110,000, a new British record. The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the \u00a31.5\u00a0million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid \u00a37\u00a0million, almost double their previous record of \u00a33.75\u00a0million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier. In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven \u00a319\u00a0million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then \u00a328.1\u00a0million to Lazio for Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. Manchester United have broken the British transfer record three times since buying Ver\u00f3n, with the signings of Rio Ferdinand in July 2002, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda in August 2014 and Paul Pogba in August 2016.\n\nTransfers in bold are also records for fees paid by British clubs\n\nHighest transfer fees received\n\nThe club's record sale came in July 2009, when they sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380\u00a0million.\n\nProgression of record fee received\nThe first player for whom Manchester United, then Newton Heath, received a fee was William Bryant, who moved to Blackburn Rovers for just \u00a350 in April 1900. That same month, Manchester City paid five times more for Scottish forward Joe Cassidy. The club's first \u00a31,000 sale came 12 years later with the sale of Harold Halse to Aston Villa.\n\nThe club's first British record sale came in March 1949, when Derby County paid \u00a324,500 for Johnny Morris. However, 35 years passed before Manchester United next broke the record for the biggest sale by a British club; the sale of Ray Wilkins to Milan for \u00a31.5\u00a0million in June 1984 was also the club's first million-pound sale. Another British record followed two years later with the sale of Mark Hughes to Barcelona for \u00a32.5\u00a0million. The club's record sale increased fivefold in the space of two transfers over the next 15 years; first with the \u00a37\u00a0million sale of Paul Ince to Internazionale in 1995, and then the 2001 transfer of Jaap Stam to Lazio for \u00a315.25\u00a0million.

He distinguished himself in this war through the capture of Tinos, as well as for his humane treatment of the Venetian captives in the Morea, in stark contrast to the brutal behaviour of the Grand Vizier, Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha. In a battle fought on 8 July 1716, he led the Ottoman fleet in the failed attempt to capture Corfu, the chief of the Ionian Islands, then under Venetian rule.\n\nDismissed from his post in February 1717, he regained it for a few days in 1730, and became once more Kapudan Pasha in 1732, holding the post until 1736.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n \n\n17th-century births\n18th-century deaths\n18th-century Ottoman military personnel\nKapudan Pashas\nSlaves of the Ottoman Empire\nOttoman prisoners of war\nOttoman people of the Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars\nPrisoners and detainees of the Republic of Venice\n\nPeople from Messenia", "machine_text": " Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha (c. 1550-1620) was an Ottoman statesman and military commander who made a significant contribution to consolidating the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. He was heavily involved in Ottoman-Safavid conflicts of the period and was a key figure in the Battle of Chaldiran (1514-1517), the Ottoman victory over the Safavid forces of Shah Ismail I of Persia. Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha was born in 1550 in Yenice, a village near Edremit in the Sanjak of Saruhan in the Ottoman Empire. His father was a deputy of the Sanjak of Saruhan and his mother was a member of a powerful tribal family. Little is known of his early life, but in 1582 he was appointed Governor (Sanjakbey) of Chios, the largest of the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea. In 1588, during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1577-1590), Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha was named General of the Ottoman navy following the death of the previous General, Kusa-Chelebi. During this period, the Ottoman navy was used to blockade seaports of the Safavids and to launch raids into Persian territory. Under his command, Ottoman forces were able to gain control of the islands of Lemnos, Chios and Crete by 1591. In 1595 Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha took part in the Battle of Chaldiran, a decisive Ottoman victory over the Safavid forces of Shah Ismail I of Persia which secured the Ottoman Empire\u2019s control over much of the Middle East. During the battle he took command of the left wing of the Ottoman army and was praised for his courage in the face of a numerically superior Safavid force. Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha continued to rise in the ranks of the Ottoman military and by 1604 he had been appointed Grand Vizier, the highest position in the Ottoman Empire at that time. He focused on consolidating the power of the Ottoman Empire and his reign marked the beginning of an era of stability in the region. Can\u0131m Hoca Mehmed Pasha was well respected for his administrative abilities and for his military skills, particularly his naval tactics. He died in 1620 in Istanbul, where a bridge and a street still bear his name today. He is remembered for his role in the consolidation of Ottoman power and was an influential figure in the history of the Ottoman Empire.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39081122}

The following year, he returned with his regiment to France. In 1765, he returned to Quebec at his father's request and inherited the seigneury of Lavaltrie the following year after his father died. Later that year, he married Marie-Ang\u00e9lique, the daughter of seigneur Louis de La Corne, dit La Corne l'a\u00een\u00e9. In 1775, he took part in the defense of Fort St. Johns (later Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) against the invading Americans and continued to aid in the defense of the colony until the Americans withdrew in 1776. Lavaltrie inherited the seigneuries of Terrebonne, Argenteuil and Monnoir but chose to relinquish them to focus on the upkeep of Lavaltrie. In 1788, he was named a justice of the peace. Although he had opposed constitutional change, Lavaltrie was elected to the 1st Parliament of Lower Canada for Warwick in 1792. He did not run in 1796 and his son-in-law, Charles-Gaspard Tarieu de Lanaudi\u00e8re, was elected in Warwick instead.

He was also active in politics, serving as a Member of the Quebec Legislative Assembly in 1775; he only served one term, however.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Netball in Africa\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Netball is a popular women's sport in parts of Africa. Several African nations are ranked amongst the top thirty in the world. As of August 2016, South Africa was ranked number Five, Malawi was ranked number Six, Uganda was ranked Seven, Zambia was ranked Sixteenth, Botswana was ranked twentieth, Zimbabwe was ranked Twenty-first and Swaziland was ranked Thirtieth in the world.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nNetball is one of the most popular women's participation sports in South Africa. While participation rates are high, there is no sense of collective identity by players as netballers and being part of a national netball community. In 2002, 40% of African girls rated netball as their favourite sport.  Many African girls claimed netball as their favourite sport even if they had never played it.\n\nThe history of South Africa's netball involvement mirrors that of other sports played in the country such as rugby union. South Africa was involved with the international netball community early in the sport's history, taking part in the 1960 meeting of Commonwealth countries in Sri Lanka to standardise the rules for the game. South Africa's international involvement was suspended because of apartheid era policies. In 1969, South Africa was expelled from competing internationally in netball. Other countries turned down tours to South Africa. Some countries, including England and New Zealand, continued to occasionally compete against South Africa, which led to their national players also being banned from international competitions. When they rejoined the community in the 1990s, internal racial tensions continued to plague the sport on the local level.\n\nIn 1994, the national team had their first international tour after a 20-year absence from international competition. The success of the South African Springboks in the 1995 Rugby World Cup had a positive impact on support for other South African national teams at international competitions, including the nation's appearance at the 1995 Netball World Championships. South Africa provided a major upset when they beat New Zealand in pool play during the tournament, with South Africa finishing second behind Australia. In 1995, the South African Police Service (SAPS) held its first National Netball Championships in Pretoria. The development of SAPS netball was not taken seriously until 1999 when they affiliated to Netball South Africa as an associated member. The Southern African Development Community has a sport competition with over 600 correctional officers from member countries participating. The 2000 national championships were held in Cape Town. In 2000, New Zealand's national side toured South Africa for the first time. The two countries played three test matches and New Zealand won them all. In 2001, a Tri-Nations Series was launched between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, which was also won by New Zealand.\n\nBotswana\n\nNetball is primarily played by women in Botswana. Girls are introduced into the game at primary schools, as part of the school curriculum. Men have traditionally served as officials, coaches and administrators for the sport. They also had their own teams. This started to change in the 2000s, with men only teams having been discontinued in favour of mixed gendered teams. The Botswana Netball Association is the national organisation responsible for netball in Botswana. It was founded in the 1970s. It is a member of IFNA and COSANA. Botswana has 30 local graded umpires and 22 locally trained coaches who have been certified by Netball South Africa. Botswana competed in the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament in 2008. Spar \u2013 \u201cGood for You\u201d Netball League is the most important national netball competition in Botswana. Naming rights for the league were given to Sar in 2010. The league is divided into two divisions, north and south. Games for the 2010 season began on 22 May. The league championships were held on 27 November 2010 at the BONA Courts in Gaborone. As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number twentieth in the world.\n\nMalawi\n\nNetball is the most popular women's sport in Malawi. The Malawi word for netball is mpira wa manja, where Mpira means \"Ball\". This name links the sport to women and those who are responsible for taking care of their families. Malawi's national team is called the Queens. In 1992, the ADMARC Tigresses won the Southern African Netball Associations trophy. A Malawian player was also named the best player in that tournament. In April 2008, Lesotho hosted the Malawi Under-21 national netball team. The match was part of the annual Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations (COSANA) tournament. In 2011, high-profile national player Mary Waya retired from the national team to take up a position as national U20 coach. That year, goal shooter Mwayi Kumwenda received a scholarship to play in the Victorian Netball League in Australia, becoming Malawi's first netball export player. Kumwenda joined the Mainland Tactix in 2014 to become the 1st African Import player into the ANZ Championship and the team has confirmed their wish to see her return for the 2015 season.  As of 2016, the women's national team was ranked number six in the world.\n\nTanzania\n\nNetball was one of the most popular sports in Tanzania. The sport was introduced to the country after World War I, when the country was under British colonial rule. The sport was intended for leisure and first played in schools. For this reason, almost all primary schools in the country have a court. Recruitment for the national team and other high level teams started at that level. The Netball Association of Tanzania (CHANETA) was created in 1966. Women have historically dominated in leadership positions in CHANETA but men are still involved, especially in roles like coaching. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a push by the International Olympic Committee and the British Council to promote sport and women's sport in Tanzania. Despite netball being the most popular women's sport at the time, no investment was made into the sport. Netball's popularity declined during the 1990s as a result of economic liberalisation. Courts were not maintained, leagues were closed and there were fewer competitions. Attempts to raise netball's popularity in the country again have been hampered by the fact that sport is culturally more acceptable for men. Top level teams in the country, prior to the 1990s, have included Tanzania Harbour Authority, and Tanzania Postal and Telecommunication. Tanzania's national team is called the Taifa Queens. In their opening match in the NTUC Fairprice Foundation Nations Cup 2010, against Singapore, they won 52\u201336. Mwanaidi Hassan was the team's star player in the tournament. Some of the top performances for the Tanzania national netball team include third place at the 2010 Nations Cup. As of 2016, the women's national team was not ranked in the world.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography", "machine_text": " Netball in Africa is a popular female sport that is growing in popularity across the continent. The African continent has a long tradition of competing in netball, with the earliest known matches being played in South Africa in the early 1900s. It has since grown steadily in popularity, particularly in countries such as Malawi, Mozambique and Botswana. In addition to the established leagues found across the continent, girls and women from Africa have also come together to take part in prestigious youth and international tournaments such as the 2015 Netball World Youth Cup Africa tournament held in Uganda, and the 2016 African Netball Championship which was held in Zimbabwe. Netball is not only an exciting and fast-paced team sport, but it also provides potential lessons and values to participants. As such, it has helped to encourage empowerment and inclusivity among many of the young women who take part in it. This has been particularly true in countries with lower education quality, as the game provides an opportunity for girls to participate in activities and build new skills, while having fun at the same time. Netball in Africa has the potential to become even more popular in the coming years; encouraged by the increasing number of African International Netball Federation and International Netball Federation sanctioned events, and with more countries, such as Uganda and Zambia strengthening their developing netball programs. With this, the continent will hopefully be able to further strengthen and expand the popularity of the game and enable more young women to participate in it. Despite the positive development of netball across Africa, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in order to ensure the continued growth of the sport. First and foremost, is the lack of funding, resources and infrastructure which has meant that many of the local and international tournaments have been cancelled due to insufficient numbers of players or an inadequate playing area. Furthermore, there have also been reports of high levels of gender discrimination and inequality in certain African countries, directed specifically towards netball events, which can further compound the difficulties of organizing and running events as well as maintaining regular training and competition fixtures. Indeed, despite the growing popularity of netball in Africa, much more still needs to be done to ensure that the game is able to fully realize its potential. Increased levels of support and investment in the game are necessary in order to help to continue the development of the sport, and ensure that the African continent can become a formidable competitive force in international netball.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31319431}

She was said to be the daughter of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, and the nominal equivalent of the Roman goddess Reverentia. She is associated with dancing and singing, activities which often do not require the use of language, suggesting that Vitsika may have originated as a pre-Hellenic deity. Her name derives from the Greek verb \u0392\u03af\u03b1\u03c9 (Bio\u00f3), which means \u201cto snap or crack open.\" Thus, her name has been linked to the cracking of a whip. This possibly signifies an energizing and invigorating influence, and perhaps the joy of loud music and dancing. In literature, Vitsika is usually depicted in the company of other gods and goddesses, as at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, where the gods and goddess attended, with Vitsika presiding over the festivities. At the marriage celebration, the laughter of the deities echoed across the sky. She is also often depicted joining the Muses in their revels at the fountain of Aganippe. Her rituals were believed to have centered around music and the sound of a flute (known as a 'Vitsika flute'), as well as sacrificing small animals to her. In some myths, she is said to have had a special harp made at Olympus, inscribed with her own name. Throughout the ages, Vitsika has remained a popular figure in Greek mythology. Ovid describes her in his Metamorphoses as \u201cJoy maddening in her laughter, every bit as seductive and voluptuous as her father Dionysus,\" Later, Apuleius describes her as \u201cthe wild carouser.\u201d For the ancient Greeks, Vitsika was a figure to be invoked in times of distress and sorrow, when joy, festivity, and laughter were needed to help banish gloom and bring brightness to one\u2019s life. Despite her association with longing, tribulation and spiritual joy, Vitsika is more often celebrated in her associations with mirth, merriment, and festivities. To this end, she is depicted in modern art as a female figure bearing a cup filled with delicious beverage and a festive object, often a flute. In modern culture, Vitsika is seen as a reminder of the power of joy and laughter to bring people together and to enliven any occasion. By offering her a toast or a simple song, one can evoke her lighthearted spirit and experience joy on a spiritual level.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42901733}

The European version also features an earlier recording of \"You're in Trouble\" as a bonus track, believed to feature Joey Cristofanilli on bass guitar. A cover of Rufus Thomas' \"Walkin' the Dog\" is also included, presumably as a nod to the 1973 Aerosmith version. It is also noted for the strong lead guitar presence of guitarist Robbin Crosby, whose trademark \"blues with a twist\" solos are prominent through the first four songs. An early version of \"Tell the World\" (which did not feature Blotzer or Croucier) was also featured on the compilation Metal Massacre, but was removed from later pressings. \"U Got It\" often opened the show circa 1983-84, and Pearcy did the same during his Nitronic 'Pure Hell' Tour in 2000.\n\nIn 1984, Atlantic Records remixed and re-released this EP following the success of Out of the Cellar.

Ratt was founded in San Diego, California in 1982 by vocalist Stephen Pearcy, guitarists Robbin Crosby and Warren DeMartini, bassist Juan Croucier and drummer Bobby Blotzer. This line-up recorded the EP, along with a second version of \"Round and Round\". The success of \"Round and Round\" prompted Geffen Records to give the band a five-album record deal. The EP was a commercial success, reaching #20 on the US Billboard Top 100 charts, selling more than one million copies, and being certified Gold. The EP opened with \"Round and Round\", a hard rock song that combined a \"bone-shaking\" guitar riff with lyrics about a girl that Pearcy had written about. It is considered one of the band's signature songs, and gained success after being included on the eponymous debut album. The flipside of the single, \"Wanted Man\", was another hard rock song, with lyrics about an outlaw on the run from the law. The single eventually peaked at #12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The second version of \"Round and Round\" featured on the EP was a live acoustic version of the song. The live acoustic performance was recorded in London during a 1984 tour. The EP is often viewed as a breakthrough for the band, and is a testament to their early classic rock sound.

It was planned to be launched on a Japanese M-V rocket from the Kagoshima Space Center.\n\nHistory\nThe vehicle would have been cylindrical, with a diameter of 2.2\u00a0m and a height of 1.7\u00a0m. It would have had four solar panels and was engineered to be spin-stabilized. Plans called for it to enter an elliptical orbit around the Moon, and deploy two penetrators at an altitude of 40\u00a0km on opposite sides of the lunar body. The penetrators were to have been braked by a small rocket at an altitude of 25\u00a0km, then free fall to the surface. They were designed to withstand a collision speed of 330 meters per second to deeply penetrate the lunar regolith.\n\nOnce the penetrators deployed, the LUNAR-A spacecraft was mission-planned to maneuver to an orbital altitude of 200\u00a0km above the lunar surface.

The project was part of the Japanese Space Exploration Program which included the team at ISAS and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The mission of the program was to study the Moon from Earth-based telescopes and by launching the Lunar-A spacecraft to the lunar surface. The Lunar-A spacecraft was launched on 8 August 1994 by an H-II rocket. The spacecraft had a total launch mass of 622 kg and consisted of two main components. The first component was the main spacecraft bus and the second component was the separate cruise stage. After launch, the lunar-A spacecraft separated from its cruise stage and began its journey to the Moon. The spacecraft was powered by a single SOZ-M-100 liquid apogee engine while the cruise stage used a Monopropellant Rocket Engine. The Lunar-A spacecraft arrived at the Moon seven days after launch and entered into a polar-orbiting trajectory. During the mission, the spacecraft mapped the lunar surface in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths in order to collect detailed topographic data. The mission was also used to study the lunar environment including the radiation environment and the solar wind interaction with the lunar surface. The spacecraft collected data for one week before its primary mission ended. During the mission, the Lunar-A spacecraft also deployed two 80 kg penetrators to the lunar surface. The penetrators were used to study the internal structure of the Moon including its gravity and magnetic fields. On 28 October 1998, Lunar-A reentered the Earth's atmosphere and was destroyed upon impact with the surface. Although the primary mission was completed, the data collected by the mission was used in subsequent missions and continues to be studied by scientists today. The Lunar-A mission was successful and resulted in many scientific discoveries. The mission demonstrated the ability of Japan to successfully launch and operate an interplanetary spacecraft and provided valuable insight into the lunar environment and formation. This mission also laid the foundation for further lunar exploration by Japan and other space agencies.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1746012}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jokkmokk Municipality\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jokkmokk Municipality (, , , ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Jokkmokk.\n\nThe name Jokkmokk is Sami for the words \"river\" and \"bend\", since the town is situated close to a bend in the nearby river. It's Sweden's poorest municipality.\n\nThe municipality is the second largest in area of all Swedish municipalities and is, with an area of 19,477\u00a0km2 (approximately 7,520 square miles) slightly smaller than Slovenia or the US state of New Jersey. It has never been amalgamated with another entity, having been that large ever since municipalities were established in Sweden in 1863.\n\nHistory\nThe name Jokkmokk is present in the Jokkmokk Lapland Court District, a historical jurisdiction. When the municipality was given its current borders in 1971, its municipal coat of arms were made to depict the hydro plant, the symbol of Lule\u00e5 (to which Jokkmokk belonged until 1673), and the traditional Sami hammers.\n\nGeography\nThe municipality is situated in the Scandinavian Mountains in Swedish Lapland and is sparsely populated. A large part of the area has been the habitat of reindeer herding Sami people for thousands of years and has for that reason been protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Laponian area. The Laponian area is roughly divided into the eastern flatlands and the western mountainous region. There are several well-structured and well-maintained starting locations for those interested in experiencing the majestic wilderness. For instance, the Kvikkjokk basecamp provides excursions and has a high quality hostel.\n\nDue to the northern location, the aurora borealis can be experienced all through winter (November to March), and the midnight sun can be experienced during June and July.\n\nThe Lule River and the Lesser Lule River flows through the district. The rivers are heavily regulated for hydroelectricity, most of all in Sweden. 6 of the 10 largest hydroelectric plants are located in the area. This includes the 977 MW Harspr\u00e5nget, the 480 MW Porjus, and the 460 MW Messaure. There's a total of 11 hydroelectric plants in the area, 9 over 100 MW, 8 over 200 MW, and 4 over 400 MW.\n\nLocalities\nThere are three official localities (or urban areas) in Jokkmokk Municipality. The municipal seat is bolded:\n\nAdditional small settlements within the municipality include the Sami reindeer herding camp Udtja and the village of Puottaure.\n\nAttractions\n\nNational parks\nThe four national parks in Jokkmokk Municipality all have their own distinct identity. The national parks are Sarek, Muddus, Padjelanta and Stora Sj\u00f6fallet.\n\nThese national parks are popular with tourists all year around but the darkest and coldest months (November to January) are not recommended for beginners. The best period for sunshine and winter activities is from February all through April, when the snow lies deep and the days are long. This time of year the national parks are easily accessible by snowmobile and skis. Visitors should understand and respect that the wilderness is just that, and snowmobiles are not allowed in the parks at any time.\n\nThe summer in Jokkmokk Municipality is short but intense. The ground is free of snow from May until late October, early November. As with most areas in the Nordic countries, the actual warm period is quite short, but as Jokkmokk Municipality has a continental climate, the temperature can top 30 degrees Celsius in the summer and reach as low as -40 degrees Celsius in the winter. During the summer months hikers and other friends of nature converge in the national parks and this is also the time when most of the parks are most easily accessed. Visitors should be warned that the amount of mosquitoes can be difficult to those not used to them and driving has an added danger in the reindeer that seek shelter from the mosquitoes. Collisions with reindeer are frequent in most of the northern parts of the Nordic countries and drivers should keep an eye out.\n\nFall is also short and the shifting colors of the wide forests make the surroundings burn with color. This is a good time for hiking but due to the shifting temperatures the mountainous parts of the national parks can be treacherous for those unprepared.\n\nOther attractions\n\nJokkmokk is known for its Sami market held the first weekend every February. This market has been held for more than 400 consecutive years. Initially a gathering of traders from the entire region the market has long since grown to be more than a simple gathering of traders and is now a week-long cultural event with lectures, art exhibitions, concerts and much more.\n\nMining\n\nThere are iron ore deposits in the region, and the proposed Kallak mine, which has been met with resistance by activists, lies within the municipality.

The home ground of the team is Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years: before Ulsan (1983\u20131989)\nUlsan Hyundai was established on 6 December 1983, as Hyundai Horang-i, with Horangi (Horangi means tiger in Korean) as its mascot. Their original franchise area was Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. They joined the professional K League from 1984 season. While they finished their debut season as 3rd place, the team's striker Baek Jong-chul became the K League Top Scorer, scoring 16 goals in 28 matches.\nThey won their first professional trophy in 1986, winning the Professional Football Championship, which is the origin of Korean League Cup.\nFrom 1987 season, the club moved their franchise from Incheon and Gyeonggi Province to Gangwon Province.\nIn the 1988 season, they finished the season as the runners-up in the league.\n\nMove to Ulsan and rise to power (1990\u20131999)\nBeginning in the 1990 season, the club moved their franchise to Ulsan, where the headquarters of several branches of owner company Hyundai are located at, from Gangwon Province.\nFormer South Korea's legendary striker Cha Bum-kun took the managerial position from the 1991 season, leading the club to the runners-up position in the league in his debut season. However, he failed to win any trophy and was replaced by Ko Jae-wook after the 1994 season.\nUnder Ko Jae-wook, Ulsan won their second Korean League Cup trophy in 1995, which was his debut season as Ulsan manager.\nUlsan won their first ever league title in 1996, beating Suwon Samsung Bluewings 3\u20132 aggregate in the championship playoffs.\nUlsan then entered a long dry-spell in terms of league trophies, although they won their third Korean League Cup trophy in 1998, beating Bucheon SK 2\u20131 aggregate in the finals.\n\nTwo Kims era (2000\u20132013)\n\nFailure to add a major title for years did affect the team negatively. After the exodus of key players like Kim Hyun-seok and a terrible start in the 2000, manager Ko Jae-wook resigned in the middle of the season.\n\nKim Jung-nam era: Gangsters of Asia (2000\u20132008)\nUlsan appointed Kim Jung-nam, who had formerly managed South Korean national football team, as their next manager. They finished runners-up in 2002 and 2003, and started to emerge as a strong force.\nIn 2005, with the return of two key players, Yoo Sang-chul and Lee Chun-soo, they qualified for the Championship Playoffs. In the play-off semi-final, they beat Seongnam Ilhwa 2\u20131, and in the final, they beat Incheon United 6\u20133 aggregate, with a hat-trick from Lee Chun-Soo in the first leg. They became the league champions for the second time in their history.\n\nThe club also went on to win the A3 Champions Cup in 2006, which they participated as K-League champions. Although they lost their first match in the competition against JEF United Ichihara Chiba 2\u20133, they beat Dalian Shide 4\u20130 and Gamba Osaka 6\u20130 to clinch the trophy. Lee Chun-soo became the competition's top scorer, scoring 6 goals in 3 matches. They repeated the merciless attacks in the AFC Champions League that season, beating Al-Shabab 6\u20130 in the first leg of the quarter-finals. These overwhelming attacks they showed in the season gave Ulsan the nickname \"Gangsters of Asia\".\n\nUlsan won the 2007 Korean League Cup, beating FC Seoul 2\u20131 in the final on 27 June 2007.  In 2008, the team changed their official name from Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i to Ulsan Hyundai FC.\n\nKim Ho-kon era: Iron Mace Football (2009\u20132013)\nManager Kim Jung-nam stepped down after the 2008 season. Kim Ho-kon, who had managed the South Korea national under-23 football team that reached the quarter-finals in the 2004 Summer Olympics was appointed as Ulsan's next manager.\n\nKim Ho-kon did not enjoy Ulsan fans' full support for his first few seasons at the club, mainly because of his defensive tactical style and unsatisfying outcomes. 2011 season was a dramatic changeover; Ulsan won their fifth Korean League Cup, beating Busan IPark 3\u20132 in the final. Ulsan also finished the season as runners-up in the K League that season. Ulsan's unique style of having many players pushing forward in counterattacks earned them the nickname \"Iron mace football\".\n\nIn 2012, the club won the AFC Champions League, defeating Al-Ahli 3\u20130 in the final on 10 November.

He began writing in the early 1980s and has since developed a body of work that has been characterized as tackling the complex emotional history of America's African American experience. Smith's plays often draw from American history, particularly the northeastern region in which he lives and grew up. His plays, including Free Man of Color, Yellowman, How I Got That Story, and Knock Me A Kiss, often center around the struggles of African Americans and their tenuous relationship with white society. Smith's work is acclaimed for its honesty and emotional depth, and has been produced at several major regional theaters including the Goodman Theater in Chicago and the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, Connecticut. Smith launched his theater career with The Rainmaker, a play he wrote for members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York City. The play was critically acclaimed and became the first in a series of plays he would write. He soon created the Off-Broadway smash hit Tulsa, which toured around the United States during the late 1980s. In 1990, his play Finishing Tusha was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and it has since been seen around the world, with productions staged in Germany, Japan, and South Africa. In the 2000s, Smith's plays continued to develop in popularity. His works, including Free Man of Color, knocked Me a Kiss, and The Piano Lesson, were greeted by widespread reviews, which praised the works for their talent for creating characters with complex and difficult personal histories. Smith\u2019s body of work has led him to become a leader in African-American theater by allowing audiences to confront and discuss the ageless questions of race and the distinctions between power and freedom within American life. Smith is an alumnus of Binghamton University in New York, and a faculty advisor for Stanford University's MFA program in dramatic writing. He is currently an artist-in-residence at the Signature Theater in Washington D.C.

Wellman and starring Spencer Tracy, Jack Oakie and Constance Cummings. After he is rejected by a woman, a man leaves his safe job and joins a gang that robs banks.  The film features actual stock earthquake footage.\n\nPlot\nA telephone line repairman named Joe Graham (Spencer Tracy) lives in Los Angeles. One night he's offered a promotion but declines telling his boss he's happy being a \"trouble shooter\" working out in the field solving problems for a living.\n\nLater Joe\u2019s co-worker and partner Dan Sutter cannot work the night shift, and Joe has to work with a new repairman called Casey, who has an aptitude for practical jokes. Joe and Casey run into some odd things during their shift, finding a corpse at the place of their first assignment.\n\nWhen the shift is over, both men go for a drink, and they find their colleague Dan very drunk in a casino. This night the police are on their way to raid the casino, but Casey hears about the raid and manages to warn both his colleagues and the casino owner, causing the raid to be a complete failure.\n\nThe next day both Casey and Joe are accused of tipping off the owner and causing the raid to be unsuccessful. In an attempt to exculpate himself, Joe tells his boss about the reason for their involvement in the events, and about Dan\u2019s visit to the casino. The result is that Dan is fired from his position without notice.\n\nJoe has been involved with one of the company\u2019s switchboard operators, Ethel Greenwood. They split up after he suspected her of dating his partner Dan one night when Joe was working overtime. Now he reconciles with her and they go back together. However, soon after they are reunited, Dan tells Ethel about how he got fired from work, and Ethel is upset with Joe for causing it. They break up again.\n\nJoe and Ethel don\u2019t see each other for a while, but he hears she quit her job and started working for another company together with Dan. It turns out the office where they work is a cover-up for a racketeering operation, run by two men by the name of George and Max. Their illegal business idea consists of tapping into the phone lines of a nearby investment company to get secret stock tips.\n\nJoe is unaware of this sly operation, until one day when he and Casey are sent to investigate the investment company\u2019s phone lines. They have complained about the lines malfunctioning,  and when Joe sees the tap he discloses the racketeering operation. Joe catches Dan red handed, as he is trying to get into the investment company\u2019s vaults and steal the contents.\n\nThe police are notified, and the robbery in progress is stopped, but Dan manages to escape from the crime scene.

Ethel is arrested for killing Dan and being an accomplice in the racketeering operation.\n\nJoe is doubtful of Ethel\u2019s involvement in the illegal business, and he doesn\u2019t believe she killed Dan.

Pearl confesses to Joe that she indeed killed Dan, and that the reason was that he was trying to trick her and take the money that was hers.

Pearl doesn\u2019t escape the house in time and is buried under the masses, but is still alive. To get Pearl\u2019s story about how she killed Dan, Joe and Casey manage to use an emergency phone line to contact her under the debris. Pearl\u2019s last confession is then heard by the police, and Ethel is released.\n\nBefore Joe can take Pearl in, however, a huge earthquake hits Long Beach, and Pearl is buried in debris. Joe and Casey rig an emergency phone line, and police Captain Flynn records Pearl's dying confession. Ethel is cleared of all suspicions and released from jail.

He is perhaps best known for being one of the earliest photographers, if not the first photographer, to enter and photograph what is now Yosemite National Park.\n\nIn 1854, during the California Gold Rush, Weed moved to Sacramento, California, and was a camera operator in the daguerreotype portrait studio of George J. Watson.  In 1855, Weed adopted the wet collodion technique, and his photographs of Gold Rush miners and settlement were much admired.\n\nEntrepreneur James Hutchings and others ventured into the area of what is now known as Yosemite Valley in 1855, becoming the Valley's first tourists. After returning to Mariposa Hutchings wrote an article about his experience which appeared in the August 9, 1855 issue of the Mariposa Gazette and was later published in various forms nationally.\n\nHutchings brought Weed to the Valley in the summer of 1859. Weed took the first known photographs of the Valley's features, and a September exhibition in San Francisco presented them to the public. Hutchings published four installments of \"The Great Yo-semite Valley\" from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine; these articles contained woodcuts based on Weed's photographs. A book by Hutchings titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California collected these articles and the book stayed in print well into the 1870s.\n\nBeginning in 1860, Weed started extensive traveling, including trips to Hong Kong (where he briefly established a studio), Hawaii, and the Far East (in 1867). Also in 1867, he presented his work at the Paris Exposition Universelle, where he won an award for landscape photography.\n\nIn 1872, Weed made another visit to Yosemite, probably in the company of well-known Yosemite photographer Eadweard Muybridge.  Weed concluded his career by working as a photoengraver.\n\nFamily \n\nCharles Leander Weed was born 1824 probably in Conesus, Livingston, New York, the son of Royal Newland Weed and Ruth Austin. He married Sarah P Irish on May 1, 1876, in Oakland, Alameda, California.  He died August 31, 1903. Both are buried in Oakland.

Famed for his portraits of the Hudson River School painters, Weed was born in Southbridge, Massachusetts and worked in Manhattan, New York City. His family moved to New York City, where he received his education at the Free School in the city. At age sixteen, Weed opened his own studio, where he painted portraits in oil and pastel of many prominent men and women throughout America. In 1844, Weed spent time studying in Florence, Italy, where he absorbed aspects of the Neoclassical movement, as exhibited in his later paintings of historical and mythological scenes. Notably, Weed became a pupil of the French painter Paul Delaroche in 1848, where he completed a number of works, including a full-length portrait of the Italian statesman Count Camillo Cavour. Weed returned to the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, when he became well known for his portraiture painting many of the luminaries of the Hudson River School. He also produced landscapes, including views of the Hudson River and its tributaries, as well as interior scenes. Although he was an established portrait artist, he paid particular attention to the details of nature and the effects of light on scene. From 1866 to 1869, he exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York, receiving a prize two times. Weed created several murals, including the paintings Unveiling the Statue of Liberty and The Flight of the Iroquois. He was also a member of the Brooklyn Art Association, the American Watercolor Society, and the Society of American Artists. His work is held in several locations, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C., Yale University Art Gallery in Connecticut, and the Historic Richmond Town, Staten Island, New York. After the death of his elder brother in 1902, Weed continued his artistic career for another year before ultimately succumbing to a long-term illness. He passed away on December 3, 1903, in Southbridge, Massachusetts, leaving an impressive legacy of cultivated American portraiture and landscapes.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16913527}

The most common definition of toy soldier refers to a miniature figurine that resembles an actual soldier in either a historical or fictional setting. Toys of this type have been around since the early 19th century, and can range from simple plastic figurines to highly intricate metal models. Toy soldiers are often used in wargaming, and can also serve as a collectible item. Another usage of the term \"toy soldier\" refers to the military action figures and playsets which have been made available since the 1970s. These are typically marketed towards children and come in both historic and contemporary styles. Action figures often come with a range of accessories such as weapons, vehicles, and buildings, and are commonly used to recreate battles from both real life and fantasy settings. The term \"toy soldier\" is also used in reference to a style of dance that gained popularity in the early 20th century. Toy soldier dances typically involve soldiers (often seen in minstrel shows of the time) marching and dancing in synchronized patterns and formations. This type of dance is still performed around the world in both traditional and modernized forms. Finally, the term \"toy soldier\" can also refer to a song written and recorded by British band Coldplay in 2000. The track was the third single off their debut album, Parachutes, and reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In conclusion, the term \"toy soldier\" has multiple meanings, the most popular being the miniature figurines which either represent real or fictional soldiers, and the associated action figures and playsets.

However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system\n\nHistory\nA Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the United Kingdom in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data and its use promotes uniformity. In addition, it can be used for administration purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.\n\nCurrent 2007 SIC codes\nThese now fall in line with the European Union industrial classification system, NACE, and the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classifications, ISIC, to and including the 4 digit class level.

The UKSIC was first published in 1980, replacing the old Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Structure which had been in use since 1950. Since then, it has been updated several times, the most recent version being version 2007, published in 2008.

The classification system covers a wide range of economic activities, from sectors such as manufacturing, public administration and defense, education, health and social work, to small- and medium-scale service activities. The system is based on four-digit codes, which represent the major descriptive categories which activities can fall into. The UKSIC is divided into 10 major divisions: A: Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, B: Mining and Quarrying, C: Manufacturing, D: Electricity, Gas, Steam, and Air Conditioning Supply, E: Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management, and Remediation, F: Construction, G: Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motorcycles, H: Transportation and Storage, I: Accommodation and Food Service Activities, J: Information and Communication, K: Financial and Insurance Activities, L: Real Estate Activities, M: Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities, N: Administrative and Support Service Activities.

Then, in the last quarter of the 18th century, bishop Dr. Pedro Cort\u00e9s y Larraz, who arrived from Cuilco in 1770 as part of the inspection he was doing of the Guatemalan dioceses, called Tejutla \"Santiago en la Cima del Monte\" (English: Santiago at the top of the hill\" and reported that there were \"sixty four families who lived very well\" in the area.\n\nThe Central American United Provinces constitution from 11 October 1821, showed Tejutla under modern San Marcos jurisdiction for the very first time.\n\nIn 1870 Tejutla reached \"Villa\" category and, due to its development, its authorities requested to the House of Representatives of Guatemala to be named a Department capital.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Smolensk (1812)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Smolensk was the first major battle of the French invasion of Russia. It took place on 16\u201318 August 1812 and involved about 45,000 men of the Grande Arm\u00e9e under Emperor Napoleon I against about 30,000 Russian troops under General Barclay de Tolly. Napoleon occupied Smolensk by driving out Prince Pyotr Bagration's Second Army. The French artillery bombardment burned the city to the ground. Of 2,250 buildings, 84% were destroyed with only 350 surviving intact. Of the city's 15,000 inhabitants, about 1,000 were left at the end of the battle inside the smoking ruins. With over 15,000 casualties, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the invasion.\n\nPrelude\n\nVitebsk operation\nThe Russian First Western Army under General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly slipped away from Vitebsk on 27 July after an inconclusive fight against Emperor Napoleon, avoiding a general engagement. Napoleon was frustrated by his inability to bring the Russian army to battle and lingered at Vitebsk until 12 August to reform his Grande Arm\u00e9e and wait for stragglers to catch up. General Jean-Andoche Junot replaced King J\u00e9r\u00f4me as commander of the Westphalian VIII Corps and the Corps joined Napoleon's main army on 4 August near Orsha.\n\nFrench situation\nAfter five weeks of non-stop operations, the main 375,000-man strike force available to Napoleon had been reduced to 185,000 men by a host of factors. 90,000 troops under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot and Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, Jean Reynier and Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg had been detached for various missions. Russian forces had inflicted thousands of combat losses on Napoleon's main army, but the primary cause in the reduction of his force was strategic consumption\u2014the need to garrison cities, towns, fortresses and forward supply depots.\n\nRapid forced marches and the inability of supply wagon trains led to high incidences of desertion and tens of thousands of losses to hunger and disease, most notably dysentery. The scorching July heat reduced the availability of water supplies. Huge numbers of cavalry horses and transportation horses and oxen had died due to a lack of grazing areas and the inability of the wagons to carry enough fodder.\n\nRussian plan\n\nThe loss of vast stretches of Russian territory to the advancing French led to a crisis and shift in power in the Russian high command. An aggressive \"Russian\" faction around Prince Pyotr Bagration called for an immediate, all-out attack against Napoleon. They were supported by Czar Alexander I and the bulk of the officer corps. The \"foreign\" faction around Barclay de Tolly, composed mostly of officers of German extraction, advocated the continuation of the present policy of delay and withdrawal to dilute Napoleon's striking power. Under strong pressure from above and below, including threats of force, Barclay agreed to an offensive on 6 August. Ignorant as to French dispositions, Barclay intended to outflank what he presumed to be the isolated corps of Viceroy Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais near Rudnia, destroy it, and inflict further losses on the French as they came to Eug\u00e9ne's aid.\n\nBarclay advanced on Rudnia and Poryeche on 7 August.Count Matvei Platov's Cossacks imposed a sharp defeat on General Horace S\u00e9bastiani's cavalry near Inkovo the same day, inflicting 600 French casualties. On 8 August, Barclay received false intelligence that Eug\u00e8ne's corps was at Poryeche and reoriented half of his army to face north. Platov was directed to rejoin Barclay's army and Bagration was to move to Vidra. Bagration disobeyed his orders, fearing French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's threat to his left flank. He declared his army was hungry and sick and moved to Smolensk. Barclay failed to stop him, merely adjusting his own forces to compensate. On 11 August, Barclay stayed put and engaged only in outpost fighting with French cavalry under Neapolitan King Joachim. On 12 August, Barclay's scouts found Poryeche empty and he directed Platov to reconnoiter the French movements. The Russian offensive had failed due to disagreements among the generals, Barclay's inactivity and pointless marches that lost the Russians time they could not recover.\n\nFrench plan\n\nNapoleon had expected a Russian offensive and saw in it a great opportunity to envelop and annihilate the Russian army. He directed Marshal Jacques MacDonald to cross the Daugava to help out Oudinot's force and ordered Oudinot and Saint-Cyr to attack Prince Peter Wittgenstein's 20,000-strong corps to prevent it from assisting Barclay. Napoleon came up with what became known as the Smolensk maneuver, a masterful operation designed to outflank Barclay from the south, cut off the Russians from Moscow and destroy the isolated Russian army, thus bringing the war to an end.\n\nThe action at Inkovo on 7 August was seen by Napoleon as heralding an immediate Russian attack. Worried, he deployed his army in a defensive posture around III Corps. By 10 August, Barclay's glacial slowness of operations had convinced Napoleon that the threat had passed. He proceeded with his maneuver. Vitebsk was garrisoned with a force of 3,800 men, which later grew to 7,000, to protect the French lines of communications. Napoleon did not know Barclay's exact location and was acting on instinct. The Grande Arm\u00e9e would advance in two huge columns commanded by Napoleon and Davout. Napoleon's column consisted of Joachim Murat's cavalry, the Imperial Guard, III Corps and IV Corps. It would cross the Dnieper at Rosasna. Davout's column would cross at Orsha, composed of I Corps, V Corps and VIII Corps. This giant force would advance east along the left bank of the Dnieper, swing north to cut the Smolensk-Moscow road and annihilate the isolated Russians. Latour-Maubourg's cavalry would attack down the Dnieper as a diversion. Napoleon's deployment remained hidden from the Russians due to a thick cavalry screen under Generals Emmanuel de Grouchy, \u00c9tienne de Nansouty and Louis-Pierre Montbrun. French engineers under General Jean Baptiste Ebl\u00e9 erected four pontoon bridges across the Dnieper near Rosasna on the night of 13\u201314 August and by daybreak the 175,000-strong Grande Arm\u00e9e was advancing rapidly toward Smolensk.\n\nBattle of Krasnoy\nBarclay had left Generalmajor Neverovski's 27th Division to guard Krasnoy, along with some cavalry and artillery. This force of 5,500\u20137,200 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 10\u201314 guns was attacked by 20,000 Frenchmen under Murat and Marshal Michel Ney beginning around 2:30 PM on 14 August. Murat's and Ney's inability to coordinate their infantry-cavalry operations allowed the Russians to get away, at the cost of 1,500\u20132,300 Russian men and seven guns as well as 500 French casualties. The French had multiple excellent chances to annihilate the Russians but failed to so.\nNeverovski retreated into Smolensk, shutting the gates behind him. The French inability to capture to the city on the fly imposed a disastrous delay on their operations. Neverovski requested reinforcements from Bagration and received Nikolai Raevsky's VII Corps, which arrived on the morning of 15 August to defend the southern bank of the Dnieper near Smolensk.\n\nBarclay learned of the French attack from Neverovski. He interpreted Napoleon's offensive as a retreat and prepared to capture Vitebsk. He ordered Bagration to move south along the Dnieper. Bagration refused, pointing out that Smolensk, Neverovski and Raevsky were in grave danger. He then received permission from Barclay to deploy to the Dnieper's southern bank at Katan. Barclay ordered General Dmitry Dokhturov's corps to join Bagration and directed the Smolensk governor to evacuate the city archives. No decisive action was undertaken by Barclay due to uncertainty about Napoleon's locations. Czar Alexander left the army and turned over command of the armies to Barclay, ordering him to defend Smolensk. Barclay decided to rush his and Bagration's men down the road from Vitebsk to Smolensk. With his entire plan of operations hanging in the balance, Napoleon failed to act with sufficient vigor and ordered a 24-hour halt to the advance instead.\n\nBattle\n\nSmolensk, a historic fortress city of 12,600 inhabitants on the main Western invasion route to Moscow, was defended by bastion towers and a thick stone wall. The River Dnieper ran through the middle. The Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk housed one of the most venerated icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Our Lady of Smolensk attributed to St Luke, and Napoleon assumed that the Russians would fight outside the city to avoid its destruction. By 16 August, French forces found the city heavily garrisoned by Bagration's troops, further reinforced with the subsequent arrival of Barclay and the main Russian army.\n\nThe main battle was fought on 16 August. An initial probing force captured two suburbs but failed to bring the Russians out to battle. Napoleon ordered a general assault with three corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, supported by two hundred artillery pieces. This was initially successful, the intense artillery bombardment setting the city on fire. French forces lacked ladders or climbing apparatus to scale the city walls and were under counter fire from Russian artillery. By nightfall, most of the city was burning.\n\nTo save the army, Barclay de Tolly abandoned the city destroying all ammunition stores and bridges leaving a small force to hold out for two days to cover his retreat. Around dawn on 17 August, Grande Arm\u00e9e Polish forces successfully breached the walls, and in a few hours the main French forces entered the city. Barclay retained forces on the other side of the river preventing a crossing until the night of August the 18th. The city was almost completely destroyed.\n\nCasualties\nBarclay de Tolly claimed 4,000 Russian casualties, while Bogdanovich spoke of 6,000 . Docturov's VI Corps had 16,800 men available prior to the battle but only 6,000 capable of combat at its end, which would mean 10,800 casualties for one Russian corps alone. Prince Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg's division lost 1,300 men alone. Gaston Bodart gave 6,000. whilst David Chandler estimates them as 12,000\u201314,000. Alexander Mikaberidze suggests 10,000 Russian casualties at Smolensk.\n\nNapoleon claimed 700 French killed and 3,100\u20133,200 wounded. His estimate is disputed, as I Corps alone under Lobau lost 6,000. Chandler puts French losses at 10,000, while Mikaberidze also suggested 10,000. Bodart listed 10,000. Russian authors claimed the French losses were as high as 20,000.\n\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, with the inscription \"SMOLENSK 17 VIII 1812\".\n\nSee also\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia\nBattle of Smolensk (1941)\nJean-Victor Poncelet\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConflicts in 1812\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles involving Russia\n1812 in the Russian Empire\nSmolensk\nAugust 1812 events\nBattles of the French invasion of Russia\nSmolensk Governorate\nBattles inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe", "machine_text": " The Battle of Smolensk (French: Bataille de Smolensk) was a major battle between the Imperial French Invasion of Russia under Napoleon and the Russian Army commanded by General Barclay de Tolly on 16-18 August 1812. It was the first major battle after the French invasion of Russia began and marked the beginning of the Patriotic War of 1812. The battle took place near the city of Smolensk and resulted in a French victory. The Russians suffered heavy losses with more than 18,000 killed or wounded and another 5,000 captured by the French. This was the first significant French victory in the Invasion of Russia, and it allowed the French to capture the city of Smolensk and occupy most of western Russia. The French were able to advance to the Russian capital of Moscow and their control of Smolensk fueled fears of a possible encirclement of the Russian Army and a potential end to the war. Napoleon's initial aim in the campaign had been to threaten St. Petersburg in order to draw Russian forces away from the Polish front; this aim had been achieved and the French had proceeded further into central Russia. To counter this move the Russians had moved their armies to the east, but it was too late. The French had already crossed the Dnieper, and had reached the banks of the Vop river, in the vicinity of Smolensk, by the 15th of August. The Imperial French Army had reached a strength of about 500,000 men, 230,000 of whom had crossed the Dnieper and were facing the larger Russian army numbering around 310,000 men. Both sides deployed in a line stretching from Vyazma to the western bank of the Vop river, with Barclay de Tolly in command of the Russians. Napoleon's plan was to attack on the flanks and split the Russian army in two, then attack the northern sector with a majority of his forces while sending a smaller intercepted of cavalry, 20,000 men under marshal Pierre-Nicolas Lahure, to the south to block the communication between the two halves. Throughout the entire day of the 16 August, and the whole next day of the 17 August, the French heavily attacked the outnumbered Russian forces, and on the 18th the French finally managed to break the Russian lines. Barclay de Tolly attempted to retreat, but was blocked from the road to Moscow. He was eventually forced to retreat further east to Borodino, where the decisive Battle of Borodino would take place just a week later. The Battle of Smolensk was the first major victory for the French in the war, and it would be the impetus that pushed Napoleon to push harder and fight his way to Moscow. Although short, the battle resulted in heavy casualties for both sides and is an important date in the history of the French invasion of 1812.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 867767}

He was the leading baritone of the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO) from 1896\u20131918, and thereafter sang roles periodically with the company until his last stage performance in 1938. From 1923-1939 he served as the director of the RSO. He also sang leading roles as a guest artist with opera companies internationally, drawing particular acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni.\n\nIn 1899, Forsell was awarded the Litteris et Artibus and, a decade later, he was named a Hovs\u00e5ngare. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music awarded him membership in 1906.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Stockholm, Forsell was the son of Carl August Forsell, a sea captain, and Axeline Forsell (n\u00e9e \u00c5berg). Before his singing career, he served in the Swedish Army; becoming a second lieutenant in 1890 and lieutenant in 1896. In 1897 he requested and was granted an honorable dismissal from the army, but continue to serve as a member of the Uppland Regiment reserves through 1901.\n\nWhile serving in the army, he pursued voice studies with Julius G\u00fcnther (1818\u20131904) at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm from 1892-1894. After graduating from college he studied singing further in Paris in 1895-1896 and later in Stockholm with Hedvig Willman (1841\u20131887) and Signe Hebbe (1837\u20131925).\n\nSinging career\nForsell made his operatic debut at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, in 1896 as Figaro in The Barber of Seville. He would remain that opera house's premier baritone through 1918, and thereafter appeared only periodically at that theatre up until his retirement from the stage in 1938. He sang in several world premieres with the company, including Wilhelm Stenhammar's Tirfing (1898) and Andreas Hall\u00e9n's Valdemarskatten (1899, the title role of Valdemar IV of Denmark). He also appeared in the Swedish premieres of Eugene Onegin (1903, title role), Tosca (1904, Scarpia), and Salome (1909, Jochanaan).\n\nForsell also established an international career. From 1902-1906 he sang regularly at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. In 1909-1910 he appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, performing such parts as Tonio in Pagliacci, Amfortas in Parsifal, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Telramund in Lohengrin, Germont in La traviata and Yeletsky in the United States premiere of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades.\n\nThe title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni was probably his most famous interpretation. He sang the part numerous times, including during the 1909 season at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, and at the 1930 Salzburg Festival. Other major opera houses in which Forsell sang the Don and various leading parts were the Berlin State Opera, the Dutch National Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. In 1915 he portrayed the role of the Foreigner/Francesco del Giocondo in the world premiere of Max von Schillings's Mona Lisa at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.\n\nOpera director, teacher, and later life\nForsell become the Director (Intendant) of the Royal Swedish Opera at the start of the 1923-1924 season, and performed less frequently on stage as a consequence. His voice, however, remained in fine condition. His final opera performance was on his 70th birthday when he sang the role of Count Almaviva in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the RSO. He retired from his director's position in May 1939 and died in Stockholm two years later. His wife, soprano Gurli Carlstr\u00f6m (married 1901), pre-deceased him in 1935. Their son, Bj\u00f6rn Forsell, was also a successful opera singer.\n\nIn addition to his administrative duties at Stockholm's opera house during the 1920s and '30s, Forsell taught voice as a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. His pupils included Joel Berglund, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling, Magna Lykseth-Scherfven, Aksel Schi\u00f8tz, Hj\u00f6rdis Schymberg, Set Svanholm, and Inez Wassner.\n\nRecordings\nForsell's gramophone legacy consists of several batches of acoustic 78-rpm discs of arias and songs (made initially by the Gramophone & Typewriter Company prior to World War I) and some subsequent electrical recordings of live stage performances. Many of these recordings are available on modern CD reissues, most notably a four-disc anthology produced in 1994 by Caprice Records (CAP 21586). When discussing Forsell's impressive legacy on disc, the British audio restoration engineer Keith Hardwick has this to say: \"His voice was a dark, warm, expressive baritone, very well produced and equalized.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1868 births\n1941 deaths\nLitteris et Artibus recipients\nMembers of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music\nOpera managers\nOperatic baritones\nRoyal College of Music, Stockholm alumni\nRoyal College of Music, Stockholm faculty\nVoice teachers\n19th-century Swedish male opera singers\n20th-century Swedish male opera singers", "machine_text": " John Forsell (born 1971), is the current CEO of Global Harvest, Inc., a large, world-wide food production and distribution company.

The area is located approximately 15 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Local Government Area (LGA) of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown. The postcode of Miller is 2168, and the suburb is bordered by Milperra, Chipping Norton, Hammondville, and Ashcroft. Miller includes a small shopping strip along Miller Street, which includes a small IGA supermarket, cafes, takeaways and other convenience outlets. Miller has a long and rich history, with settlers arriving in the area as early as 1810, when the Reverend Samuel Marsden granted the land to Robert Mein, which he later sold to Thomas Hassall in 1829. With Hassall having prospered from the sale of cattle and the proceed from natural timber, he sold parts of the estate to the Pitt family and Captain Peter McIntyre. The area was known as Pitt Town until 1949, when the suburb was given the name 'Miller' in honour of Neil Miller, one of the original settlers. Miller has since become a popular residential area, and is home to a variety of people, representing many cultures and origins. The area is mainly residential, but it also includes several schools, including Miller Public School, Miller Technology High School, and Sacred Heart Primary School. There are also a number of parks, including Miller's Lagoon, Kingsgrove Park and McAllen Park, plus numerous reserves, such as Hammonds Paddock and Mein Reserve. Miller is a well-connected suburb, with several bus services operating throughout the area and a railway line running nearby at Milperra station. The nearest major shopping facilities are located at Bankstown and Liverpool.

The 2002\u201303 season began with the team's first ever playoff appearance in Vancouver. Despite the strong regular season record in 2001\u201302, the Canucks lost to the Colorado Avalanche in six games. The regular season began on October 10, 2002 and ended on April 6, 2003.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Channel stuffing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Channel stuffing is a business practice in which a company, or a sales force within a company, inflates its sales figures by forcing more products through a distribution channel than the channel is capable of selling.  Also known as trade loading, this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures.  Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly-managed sales force attempting to meet short-term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term.\n\nChannel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with the excess inventory, leads to costly overtime and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as the sales department works to make up for prior overselling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels, because salespeople no longer adequately qualify their prospects. \n\nOccasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing by their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. That is done by holding back on orders until the end of a supplier's quota period. The supplier's sales force then panic, and sell a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. That affects customers, creating gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. \n\nCorporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide the activity from their investors. In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in some cases litigated against such corporations, and private class-action suits have been filed.  Channel stuffing might also be part of a broader pattern of financial impropriety.\n\nReferences \n\nEthically disputed business practices\nMarketing techniques", "machine_text": " Channel stuffing is a type of inventory fraud associated with the marketing and sales practices of a business. In channel stuffing, companies force their distributors to take multiple shipments of goods that they cannot immediately sell or use. The aim of channel stuffing is to artificially inflate sales and profits of a particular period and deceive investors, creditors and shareholders. It is a form of financial statement manipulation done by companies in an effort to enhance their financial performance. The result of channel stuffing is an increase in the quantity of goods reported on the income statement as sales, but which actually do not move into the marketplace. The effect of this can be wide-ranging, including overstated sales results, inventory imbalances, strained relationships with customers and partners, and ultimately, it may lead to incorrect financial results and a possible SEC filing violation. Channel stuffing is a form of fraud because it undermines the integrity of a company's financial results by creating misrepresentations in the firm's financial reporting. It involves the mis-allocation of goods as they pass through a supply chain, which, if not managed properly, can result in inflated inventory levels, unhealthy customer relations and an incorrect view of sales. Channel stuffing is thought to occur when 1) a company has an incentive to recognize additional sales or revenues; 2) a company has access to delivery channels for the goods, or; 3) when a company needs to turn around its financial fortunes in the short-term. Companies indulge in channel stuffing in an attempt to artificially boost their sales and profits. Businesses can employ this technique by shipping more goods than necessary to distribution centers, selling goods to customers at a discount to move more inventory, and allowing retailers to return more stock than usual. This form of manipulation makes financial statements inaccurate as it is based on transactions that are not properly reflecting the actual conditions of the market and the supply and demand of goods. Channel stuffing is considered a serious form of corporate fraud and carries penalties under the law. It can lead to indictment or significant fines, or both. For example, in 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an executive and two companies of channel stuffing (among other things) and ordered them to pay over US $9 million in fines and disgorgements. In conclusion, channel stuffing is a manipulative practice meant to artificially increase a company's sales and income by moving goods improperly or to customers that do not intend to buy. It undermines the integrity of financial statements and is subject to criminal and/or civil penalties. Investors should carefully monitor signals that a company may be channel stuffing, such as significantly increasing inventory and cash sales.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2031489}

Pinafore (1878) and Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance (1880).\n\nHe later became a noted voice teacher and continued to perform, mostly at society events. On the death of his elder brother, in 1903, he became the seventh baronet of Kilfane.\n\nEarly years\nPower was born in Kilkenny, the fourth son of Sir John Power of Kilfane, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Wade, from Clonabrany, County Meath. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin, and studied voice in Milan and Florence from 1873 to 1876, with Achille Graffigna and Francesco Lamperti, among others.\n\nIn 1876, Power first appeared on stage at the Teatro Manoel in Valletta, Malta, singing Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville.  He made his London stage debut in December 1877 at Her Majesty's Theatre playing the tenor role in Thomas Haynes Bayly's English version of Adolphe Adam's opera The Swiss Cottage. This proved to be Power's only appearance in serious opera.\n\nPower joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy-Opera Company in February 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, succeeding George Bentham in the leading tenor role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer. From March to April 1878 Power also played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that companion piece was added to the bill at the Opera Comique. He created the role of Ralph Rackstraw in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, \"one of the most successful pieces of musical theatre of the Victorian era\" playing the character from May 1878 to February 1880. The Daily News wrote that Power \"displayed a light tenor voice of very agreeable quality, and acted the part of the sentimental lover well\", although The Times found his intonation \"a little uncertain\".\n\nWhen The Pirates of Penzance premiered in London, Power originated the role of Frederic in that opera. Power received warm reviews for this role from the London press. The Times said that his \"sympathetic tenor voice was heard to great advantage in the sentimental music\", and The Standard wrote that he \"acts ... just in that simple-minded way that brings out most strongly the absurdity of the character, and he sings exceedingly well.\" A critic from The New York Times, however, commented: \"Temple has been a member of the Gilbert-Sullivan company from the first.  Mr George Power has not: and his \"thin\" style is a material drawback. As an actor, he is weak, as a man he is not interesting, as a tenor he is small. Once or twice he sang sweetly, and he was always in tune.  As a concert singer he would probably be very successful in sentimental ballads; as Frederic he is unsatisfactory.\" The Era agreed with the majority: \"a very agreeable light tenor voice and a pleasing style, qualities which have already gained for him no little favour in the previous opera \u2026 [he has] good taste vocally and a fair amount of histrionic skill.\"\n\nDuring the run of Pirates, Power took part in some Sunday matin\u00e9e performances of new operettas along with D'Oyly Carte colleague Rutland Barrington, and on one occasion acted in a non-musical play, L'Aventuri\u00e8re, given in the original French by a cast headed by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Power played Frederic until October 1880, when he left the D'Oyly Carte company.\n\nLater years\n\nOver the following months, Power performed mostly in society concerts. In May 1881, he appeared in the operetta Incognito, by Henri Log\u00e9, and in July 1881, Power played Lieut. de Blanc-Mange in a short operetta, Out of Sight, by Frederick Clay and B. C. Stephenson. In August 1881, he created the role of Charles Lorrimore in the Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens comic opera Claude Duval, at the Olympic Theatre, opposite Marion Hood, who had been his partner in The Pirates of Penzance. The production ran for only 54 performances, and Power left the production three days before it closed in October.\n\nPower then became a teacher of singing, continuing to make occasional appearances on the stage until he end of the century, mostly in concert and society events, and with Percy North's Operetta Company. In 1885 he played Colonel Sylvester at Hove in a new operetta, When One Door Shuts Another Opens by Harriet Young and Charles Thomas. His students included the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing.\n\nWhen his elder brother Sir Adam Clayton Power (1844\u20131903) died, Power succeeded to his family's baronetcy as the seventh baronet of Kilfane. Together with Jessie Bond, Leonora Braham and Julia Gwynne, he was one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside Arthur Sullivan Memorial in the Victoria Embankment Gardens.\n\nOn 2 September 1915, by then in his late 60s, Power married Eva Gertrude Boulton (1864\u20131952), the daughter of family friend Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton and Sophia Louisa Cooper. There were no children, and the Power baronetcy ended on his death in 1928.\n\nPower died in Kensington, London, aged 81, and is buried in the Boulton Family Vault in Brookwood Cemetery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPower interviewed in The Era, 18 July 1908, p. 15\n \n\n1846 births\n1928 deaths\nPeople educated at Cheltenham College\nAlumni of Trinity College Dublin\n19th-century British male opera singers\nBaronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom\n19th-century Irish male opera singers", "machine_text": " Sir George Power, 7th Baronet (1744 \u2013 1802) was a British politician and baronet.

His paternal grandfather had succeeded in 1709 as baronet of Irnham, Lincolnshire, a title created in 1641 for his ancestor Sir Ambrose Power. Power entered parliament in 1774 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Plympton Erle and held the seat until 1790. He later represented Midhurst from 1793 to 1795 and Hindon from 1796 to 1802. Power was a farmer and a sometime owner of racehorses. He also owned four estates. He outlived two of his wives and died without any surviving children. He was succeeded as baronet by his half-brother Edward, who had predeceased him. Sir George Power became a member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1778, an association of scholars who had visited Greece and Italy, and he communicated on geological subjects in 1777 with Erasmus Darwin. He was appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1787\u201388, and in 1794 was a colonel in the Lincolnshire local militia. He was a supporter of the Round Tablers, a group set up by King George III to support the interests of the peerage. He was a friend of the writer Horace Walpole and was noted for his wit and mastery of repartee. His second wife, Eleanor Liege, predeceased him in 1791 and he married his third wife, Sarah Clavering, in 1793. He was also a member of the Grand Order of the Star of India, a British hereditary order, and enjoyed wearing a plum-coloured coat of arms. He died, childless, at Irnham in 1802 and the estates passed to Sir Edward Power, an illegitimate son of Sir Thomas, who by special remainder was created baronet. Sir George Power was buried in Irnham Parish Church and a monument, with an inscription to him, was erected by his widow. He is also memorialised by a parish in Qu\u00e9bec bearing his name, Power Township, given in his memory by the Canadians in 1816 for his service as a Member of Parliament. In 2000 Queen Elizabeth II honoured him by designating Irnham, the former Power estate, a site of Special Scientific Interest.

It is difficult to accomplish in part because of the extremely careful regulation of temperature required to fuse the enamel without damaging the glass in which it is embedded. The edges of the foil form a frame for the enamel, giving the appearance, as artist William Claude Harper described it, of \"the most delicate cloisonn\u00e9 that you can imagine\".\n\n1950s rediscovery\nIn 1953, metalsmith Margret Craver saw a pin decorated using the technique.  Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing it over the course of about thirteen years to reproduce it.  Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.

The club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896, joining the Junior Division. In 1928 the club joined the Sussex County League. Despite finishing as runners-up in Division One on six occasions, they had to wait until 1990\u201391 before lifting the championship \u2013 the only time they have done so, having finished as runners-up to Wick the previous season \u2013 clinching the title on the last day of the season, at nearest rivals Peacehaven & Telscombe.\n\nThat season was undoubtedly the finest in the Marigolds\u2019 history. As well as finishing as Division One champions, the club also reached the 1st Round of the FA Cup where they were beaten 4\u20130 by Northampton Town in front of a crowd of 4,000 at The Sportsfield.

Unfortunately, and as so often appears to be the case in West Sussex, the club lost manager Carl Stabler and most of the previous season's squad during the close season (many to Wick) and from being amongst the championship favourites the previous season, were now hotly tipped as relegation fodder. That proved to be the case and the Marigolds were always struggling throughout 2006\u201307, under new manager Trevor Waller, with a largely young and inexperienced squad.\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season saw the club finish as champions of Division Two, gaining promotion to Division One.\n\nLittlehampton won the 2014\u201315 Sussex County Football League, finishing 1st. They however were not promoted after not applying for the Isthmian League. Their Twitter account said that \"we don't want to\", although it is likely they couldn't because their ground would not pass the grading test for Step 4 teams.\n\nGround\nLittlehampton Town play their home games at The Sportsfield, St Floras Road, Littlehampton, West Sussex, BN17 2BD.\n\nHonours\n Sussex County League Division One\nWinners (2): 1990\u201391,\nRunners Up (9): 1946\u201347, 1971\u201372, 1973\u201374, 1975\u201376, 1981\u201382, 1983\u201384, 1984\u201385, 1989\u201390, 1997\u201398\n Sussex County League Division Two\nWinners (3): 1996\u201397, 2003\u201304, 2012\u201313\n\nCup honours\nSussex Senior Winners 1969/70 \nThe Sussex Royal Ulster Rifles Charity Cup\n Winners (4): 1946\u201347, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1983\u201384 \n Runners Up (3): 1976\u201377, 1981\u201382, 1988\u201389\nSussex County Football League John O'hara League Cup\n Runners Up (1): 2012\u201313\nSussex County Football League Division Two Cup\n Runners Up (1): 2012\u201313\n\nRecords\nHighest League Position:\n1st in Sussex County League Division One: 1990\u201391, 2014\u201315\nFA Cup Best Performance\nFirst Round: 1990\u201391\nFA Vase Best Performance\nSemi Final: 1990\u201391\n\nNotable former players\n1.

Looking up from Meerikot one can find another fortified citadel - Shergarh (Abode of Lions) built with whitish stone, it too has five bastions. Though its location at 1480 feet above the sea level makes this fortress a unique structure, it also makes it equally difficult for supply of water, which can only be had from the brooks and rain streams, hundreds of feet below.

The majority of the population is Hindu, belonging to the Warriach, Banyat and other local clans. The village is an agro-based society, and is known for its production of various kinds of crops including wheat, mustard, chickpeas, sesame and cotton. The local language spoken by most of the people in Shergarh is Sindhi but some people also understand and speak the local Thari language. The village is also known for its historical significance. Almost 500 years ago, during the rule of Mir Ghulam Murtaza Talpur, Shergarh was established as a taluka (sub-division) in ROketa District. Later, it became a part of Thar and Parkar district. The famous Hindu temple of Shiva, dedicated to Lord Rama and Sita, is located in Shegrarh. This temple is said to have been built by Mir Ghulam Murtaza Talpur about 430 years ago. One of the most well-known inhabitants of this village was Raja Duleep Singh. Duleep Singh was popularly known as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\" and also the \"Lion of Punjab\". He was originally from Nepal and came to Shergarh in 1850. He supported the British Raj and was loyal to the British Raj even before the 1857 sepoy mutiny. Duleep Singh was a great admirer of the local people in Shergarh and frequently visited the village. Shergarh is renowned for its festivities, such as \"Nag Panchimi\", \"Nandi Pujan\" and other local festivals. The inhabitants of the village celebrate these festivals with great fanfare and enthusiasm, and these are also attended by people from nearby villages. In terms of education, Shergarh has two schools, one primary and one high school. The village also has a library where students can borrow books, magazines and newspapers.

Described as a \"dark, mature sounding record\" the album explores themes such as mental health and relationships with an introspective yet aggressive approach. A major streaming success, Depravity received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and the Juno Award for Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year. The lead single, \"Do You Know?\", was released on February 28, 2020. The song blends elements of rock, hip hop and trap, featuring samples of vocal harmonies. It was positively received by critics, garnering praise for its aggressive nature and the bands potential. The second single, \"Outcast\", was released on March 6, 2020. Accompanied by an abstract visual, the song is a dark and emotionally charged rap track. It was met with favorable reviews from critics, being praised for its hypnotic production and taunting lyrics. Depravity is a hybrid of rap, rock and trap, combining elements of each genre seamlessly. While on its surface there is a general sound that ties the whole album together, each song manages to stand out from one another: from the bold and melancholic \"Inside Out\" to the whirlwind of \"Deadly Charges\". The band is masterful at creating catchy melodies throughout the album and their versatile nature keeps each track feeling fresh. The production on the album is driven by heavy bass and 808 beats, as well as live instrumentation on some tracks. While the production adds a dynamic to the project, it's the bands poignant lyricism and delivery that stands out the most. Tragically honest, each bar and verse speaks to personal struggles and conveys an overarching message of perseverance. Depravity is an ambitious debut that radiates potential and shows an artist at the peak of their creative ability.

Hamid tells him about his father, his teachings and how his absence has changed their lives. Meanwhile, Hamid's mother is not able to make peace with the fact that her husband has disappeared. She is always lost in her grief and is dejected. \nHamid tries to learn his father's boat-making craft among various other means to please Allah, in belief that his father might return some day. Finally on one of the days Hamid realizes that his father is dead and would never return. His mother comes to terms with his death on the very same day. In the epilogue it is shown that Hamid finally gets his much desired red paint for the newly deigned boat (probably sent by the CRPF jawan), paints it and sails on it with his mother.\n\nThe film denotes how eventually people learn to deal with tragedies and move on no matter what, and serves as a powerful depiction of human resilience. What is striking is also the fact that despite being naive the boy knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong due to his father's teachings, again stressing the fact that we are a result of our upbringing.\n\nCast\nTalha Arshad Reshi as Hamid\nVikas Kumar as Abhay \nRasika Dugal as Ishrat\nSumit Kaul as Rehmat\nMir Sarwar as Abbass\nBashir Lone as Rasool Chacha\nVeer Rajwant Singh as Rajinder\nAshraf Nagoo as Basheer\nQazi Faiz as Beggar\nUmar Adil as Police Officer\nGulam Hussain Barji as Shopkeeper\nSajid as Police Constable\nShafia as Noor\n\nMarketing and release\nThe theatrical release poster of the film was released on 11 February 2019 giving the release date as 1 March 2019.

It runs from State Highway 31 in Quinton north to intersect State Highway 9 near Enterprise. It then continues north to Lake Eufaula Dam, and then turns east to end at State Highway 2. It has no lettered spur routes.\n\nRoute description\n\nState Highway 71 begins at SH-31 on the west side of Quinton in northeast Pittsburg County. The highway initially follows the Quinton street grid, which takes it in a north-northwest direction. As the grid peters out on the outskirts of town, SH-71 breaks away to the west and then to the northwest to avoid Beaver Mountain, gradually curving around to a northerly heading as it approaches the county line. The route crosses into Haskell County about three miles north of Quinton.\n\nThe road continues north in Haskell County until it veers northeast and crosses Longtown Creek. The road then turns back north, passing through rural parts of the county. SH-71 intersects SH-9 in the unincorporated community of Enterprise, just over five miles (8\u00a0km) north of the Pittsburg\u2013Haskell county line.  North of Enterprise, SH-71 parallels Brooken Creek until it drains into Lake Eufaula. The highway serves the boat docks and campgrounds on the east side of the lake, which is the largest entirely within Oklahoma. SH-71 then runs across the dam impounding the lake, bringing it into McIntosh County.\n\nSH-71 merely cuts across the southeast corner of McIntosh County; the highway spends only  within its boundaries. It soon enters Muskogee County, now on an eastbound trajectory. The road runs through the Canadian River valley, staying between the river and Hi Early Mountain. The route next turns northeast, away from the river but still skirting the mountain's base. It finally comes to an end at SH-2 about  south of Porum.\n\nHistory\n\nJunction list\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSH-71 at OKHighways\nSH-71 at Roadklahoma\n\n071\nTransportation in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Haskell County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in McIntosh County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Muskogee County, Oklahoma", "machine_text": " Oklahoma State Highway 71 is a north-south highway in the US state of Oklahoma.

The highway begins at a junction with US 69 near Iron Post and travels northwards through rural McCurtain County. As it approaches Idabel, the highway passes through residential areas before intersecting US 259 in the east side of Idabel. From US 259 the highway continues on a northwesterly route through rural parts of McCurtain County, passing several towns and small settlements. In Pawnee County, OK-71 intersects State Highway 18, before reaching its northern terminus at US 62 just east of Pawnee. Overall, OK-71 runs for approximately 95 miles (152.89 km). It serves as an important connection between two major routes, US 59 and US 62, and is an important route for local commuters, freight carriers, and tourists. A nearby section of the road is one of the few places in Oklahoma where the original pre-1920s road still remains, and this section is known as the Old Oregon Trail. OK-71 has been a continuous route since at least 1922 when it was originally designated in the state of Oklahoma. In the mid-1990s the road was improved by resurfacing and was also widened in a few places. The road also underwent several bridge improvements in recent years. OK-71 is clearly marked along its entire route, and provides reliable transportation for residents of the area. The highway also serves as an important link to a number of popular tourist destinations, including the Red Slough Wildlife Management Area, the Ouachita National Forest, and Lake Wister State Park. Overall, Oklahoma State Highway 71 is a key transportation route for the northeastern-most part of the state. It provides an important connection for local commuters and travelers, as well as an important link to several tourist destinations.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5648618}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tracy Jordan\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tracy Jordan is a fictional character in the American television series 30 Rock, played by the actor Tracy Morgan. The character is a movie star whose personality traits and life events are taken from Morgan's own life. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly ranked him the 55th Greatest Character of the Last 20 Years.\n\nFor his portrayal of Jordan, Tracy Morgan has received one Primetime Emmy Award nomination, two Image Awards nominations, and seven Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one.\n\nConcept\nTracy Jordan is a rich, famous B-list movie star with a reputation for unpredictable behavior. At the time newly installed NBC executive Jack Donaghy forces writer Liz Lemon to hire Jordan as the new star of her sketch comedy program The Girlie Show in the pilot episode of the series, Jordan was in a career slump, having made no new movies for two years. Upon hiring Tracy, Jack renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to the chagrin of Liz. Throughout the series, Jordan enjoys renewed success through his starring TGS role and other performances and ventures.\n\nCharacter history\nJordan is a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and slave Sally Hemings. Jordan was born in Yankee Stadium but the exact date is unknown as he has no birth certificate. He was given the honorary birthday of February 24, shared with TGS Co-star Jenna Maroney in the March 5, 2009 episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\". Tracy grew up in a tough neighborhood in The Bronx called \u2018Knuckle Beach\u2019, though many of his claims about it sound fictitious.\nAs a child, Jordan was a cast member on the Nickelodeon show Ray Ray's Mystery Garage. He also claims to have attended middle school in an Exxon station. He lived with his single mother in 1979, dropped out of Frank Lucas High School over his inability to dissect a frog, and claims to have spent time busking as a bucket drummer. He was discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984.\nJordan did a Christmas album in 1998 and is a big fan of Pat Benatar. In addition to his acting career, he writes a column in Ebony Magazine called \"Musings\". He owns several houses but got into debt because he didn't make the payments on them.\n\nCharacter traits\nJordan is a self-centered prima donna. For instance, in \"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\", Tracy says, \"Perfection is my middle name. 'Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy'.\" He aspires to own an island.\nJordan is treated for a mental health disorder by Dr. Leo Spaceman, a doctor of questionable integrity and qualification, who describes Tracy's problems as \"erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my (Spaceman's) highly experimental treatments.\" He is unable to perform a scene the same way twice (\"Future Husband\"), making his employ as an actor difficult. Jordan is also a conspiracy theorist who believes, for instance, in shadow organizations and vampires. \nDespite all this, the character is supposed to be generally well-meaning and more intelligent than he appears. He periodically surprises his coworkers with his knowledge of proper grammar (for example, telling Toofer in \"The Aftermath\" that \"Superman does good, you're doing well\") and advanced vocabulary, though these vignettes are often played for comedy. He is able to remember details of American history and is able to answer trivia questions correctly. He also has a sensitivity to the mistreatment of African Americans. Tracy has an interest in American Revolutionary history, which he studied after learning of his relation to Thomas Jefferson, attempting to produce and star in a Jefferson biopic. In \"Corporate Crush\", while struggling to secure funding for his film, he tells Liz \"You're my Alexander Hamilton!\" In \"Winter Madness\" he argues with several Freedom Trail historical reenactors in Boston for misrepresenting the racism of the Founding Fathers and the date of Crispus Attucks' death.\n\nJordan often implies that his clownish behavior is mostly an act, which he maintains because his childish persona is responsible for his success as an entertainer. This seems to be supported by Jordan's occasional moments of maturity, such as when he behaves professionally for an entire week in \"The Natural Order\" to prove to Liz Lemon that he is capable of acting like an adult. However, he soon reverts to his old personality, admitting he is more comfortable being immature.\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\nTracy and his wife Angie have been married since 1991. They like to roleplay, including 'playing rape', when he wears a ski mask. Jordan often walks around his house naked to show his oldest male child \"who got the biggest ding-dong\".\nWith Angie, Tracy has two sons, named Tracy Jordan Jr. and George Foreman Jordan (played by Dante E. Clark), and a daughter, Virginia, who is born during season 5. Tracy also has a self-styled illegitimate son named Donald (played by Michael Benjamin Washington), an entrepreneur whom Tracy supports financially despite knowing that he is not actually his son; Donald is two years older than Tracy.\n\nAlthough he \"parties with women to keep up his rap credentials,\" Tracy maintains loyalty to his wife, admitting to Jack Donaghy in \"The Ones\" that he has never cheated on her. Because his womanizing persona is integral to his success as an entertainer, Tracy's career takes a downturn in \"Don Geiss, America, and Hope\" when his monogamy becomes known to the public, in a reverse parody of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal of 2009.\n\nTracy spent most of his childhood in foster care. He once lived with his birth mother, but lost touch with her: in \"The Moms\" he is not sure of her whereabouts or even her name. Tracy's biological father is unknown; Tracy presumes him dead since he has never come forward to ask Tracy for money. In \"Nothing Left to Lose,\" Tracy shares memories of a father who abandoned him for a second family in Ohio (going on to have a daughter who is also named Tracy), but the effect of this upon the show's continuity is unclear.\n\nWith Liz\nTracy refers to Liz by either her last name or her full name, for example, \"Too late, Liz Lemon!\" Jordan treats Liz with contempt and mimics her. However, in later seasons he begins calling her \"LL\", following a trend of often calling characters by their initials.\n\nWith his entourage and friends\nJordan tends to loiter around the studio with his entourage, former high school classmate Grizz and professional entourage member Dot Com.  Jordan develops a close friendship with NBC page Kenneth Parcell, who willingly runs errands for him and periodically serves as a member of his entourage.  Kenneth often puts himself in harm's way to help Jordan.  Jordan helps Kenneth with his shyness around women, and considers himself a mentor to Kenneth.  He is more sympathetic to Kenneth than most of the other characters are.  For example, when Tracy quit TGS after learning he no longer needed the money he earned from the show, it was Jack's threat to fire Kenneth that made Tracy change his mind, returning to the show in order to keep Kenneth employed (\"The Bubble\").  Kenneth acted as an asexual, de facto, on-set wife to Jordan during his brief estrangement from Angie (Season 2).\n\nWith Jenna\nJordan and Jenna often disagree. For instance, whether it is more difficult to be a black man or a white woman in America (\"Believe in the Stars\"). However, they have some friendly moments at times and become closer, assuming they are both \"special people\".  There is also an increasing occurrence of the two being involved in shenanigans together.\n\nJordan's life\n\nCareer\nJordan has a reputation for being uncontrollable and his habit of insulting powerful movie executives costs him roles. However, Jordan's engagements are many and varied.\n\nPolitics\nJordan is not overly interested in politics. Jack tried to recruit Jordan to join the Republican Party, but Jordan came to realize that African-Americans would never support the GOP. In 2007 Tracy's wife objects to him playing Barack Obama because, \"...we support [Dennis] Kucinich.\" In the 2008 US Presidential Election, Jordan voted for Ralph Nader.\n\nReligion\nJordan is not religious. He once considers becoming Catholic, but is dissuaded by Jack due to, as expected, intolerance of guilt. In \"The Ones,\" when Jordan arranges for Jack to come clubbing with him to see if Jack can remain faithful to his fianc\u00e9e Elisa, Jordan compares the temptation to \"Jesus in the wilderness,\" before clarifying that Jesus is the name of a person he knows and \"the Wilderness\" is a club they'd attended. Jordan once wrote a novelty song entitled \"Werewolf Bar Mitzvah\", which he recorded for Geffen Records. The lyrics include \"Werewolf bar mitzvah, spooky, scary! Boys becoming men; men becoming wolves!\" He learns some Hebrew phrases. In the first episode of season 4 (entitled Season Four) of the show, it is revealed that Tracy may as well actually be Jewish. When asked about his disconnection to his roots, he said, \"Have I lost touch with my roots? I've gotta talk to Rabbi Shmuley about this.\"\n\nFinances\nDespite his personality difficulties, Jordan succeeds financially. For example, he makes $300 million by creating and marketing a pornographic video game, and then invests the profits in a company that dismantles bank signs during the financial crisis.\n\nDeath \nIn Episode 21 of Season Five, it is revealed in an end credit scene that both Jordan and Maroney died on March 17, 2016 of an unknown cause. This has been proven to be false in the events of \"30 Rock: A One-Time Special\" which is set in July 2020 and Tracy and Jenna have both been shown to be alive with the former living in Canada.\n\nTrivia\nIn Tina Fey's original pilot script for 30 Rock, Jordan was called \"Lawrence Jordan\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n30 Rock characters\nFictional actors\nFictional African-American people\nFictional comedians\nFictional criminals\nFictional characters from New York City\nTelevision characters introduced in 2006\nFictional television personalities\nNarcissism in television\nAmerican male characters in television", "machine_text": " Tracy Jordan (born 1964) is an American actor, comedian, and musician.

Shaw, namesake of \"Two Buck Chuck\".\n\nSpurrier went on to stage the influential \"Judgment of Paris\" Tasting of 1976, when a Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon from California were ranked above some of the most prestigious wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux.\n\nSpurrier sold his wine interests in France and returned to the UK in 1988, becoming a wine consultant and journalist. He was director of The Christie\u2019s Wine Course, which he founded with Christie's Education in 1982. He was also a wine consultant to Singapore Airlines, and consultant editor to Decanter. In 2018, he starred in the documentary SOMM 3 alongside Jancis Robinson where he discussed the Judgement of Paris while tasting some of the world's finest wines. In 2019, he founded the Academie du Vin Library with Simon McMurtrie to publish wine writing. The Library published the latest edition of his memoir in 2020.\n\nAwards\nSpurrier received several international awards for wine writing including Le Prix de Champagne Lanson and the Bunch Prize, both for articles published in Decanter. In 2001 he was awarded Le Grand Prix de l\u2019Academie Internationale du Vin and The Maestro Award in honor of Andre Tchelistcheff. In 1988 he was made Le Personalite de l\u2019Annee (Oenology) for his services to French wine. He has also received the Ritz Carlton Millennia Singapore Lifetime Achievement Award and the Prix Louis Marinier. He was a regular judge on the international wine tasting circuit and the chairman of the Japan Wine Challenge and the Decanter World Wine Awards.\n\nPortrayal\nAlan Rickman portrayed Steven Spurrier in the 2008 film Bottle Shock. During its production, Spurrier warned of taking legal action in the event of misrepresentation. Having read the script, Spurrier stated, \"There is hardly a word that is true in the script and many, many pure inventions as far as I am concerned\". A documentary by Jason Wise about the 1976 tasting is planned for release in summer 2022.\n\nPersonal life\nSpurrier was married to the former Bella Lawson from 1968 until his death. Together, they had two children: Christian and Kate.\n\nSpurrier died from cancer on 9 March 2021, at his home in the Bride Valley English Wine Estate, in Litton Cheney, Dorset.

He is most recognized for his major role in launching the 1976 Judgment of Paris, a French wine tasting event in which Californian wines were compared to French. His results shocked the world at the time due to the California wines surpassing the French ones. Spurrier is the current owner of the Wine Workshop and Academy, which he founded in 1998 as a wine school in Paris. Born in Colchester, Spurrier studied history and philosophy at the University of Durham, and then took up a job as the manager of the wine department at London retailer Corney & Barrow in 1965. In 1967, he founded the then-novel wine shop Les Caves de la Madeleine, specialising in sourcing French wines from small independent growers. In 1969, he moved to Dolly\u2019s wine merchants and quickly established himself as the voice of the English wine trade. In 1969 Steven Spurrier went on a major tour of California, impressing the local winemakers while attracting the attention of the wine press. In 1976, the famous Judgement of Paris wine tasting was a contest to settle the competition between French and Californian wines in which Spurrier was the main organizer. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from both countries were tasted by a panel of nine French judges. Surprisingly, the California wines won on both categories, shaking up the international wine trade with unexpected results. Spurrier\u2019s career continued with his consulting work for retailers, his extensive wine writing, and his work for Decanter magazine, where he contributed as a columnist. In 1996, he took up a position as the in-house wine expert at Christie\u2019s in London and three years later, he founded his namesake Wine Workshop and Academy in Paris. Located in the Latin Quarter near Boulevard Saint Germain, the school offers a range of courses to learn about wine, from basic knowledge to world-wide qualifications. Spurrier is referred to as an educator, mentor, and ambassador for the international wine culture, and was awarded the Chevalier De L\u2019Ordre Du M\u00e9rite Agricole in 2002 and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006. He is also the author of several award winning guides and books about the various aspects of the wine trade and culture. The Judgment of Paris was the defining moment in Spurrier\u2019s career. Decades later, the spotlight continues to shine on the original event and its organizer, as both California and French producers benefit from its publicity and impact. To date, Steven Spurrier continues to work as a wine educator in private courses and special events.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3167331}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Caregiver burden\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Caregiver burden is the stress which is perceived by caregivers due to the home care situation.  The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation.\n\nTheory \nFrom a scientific perspective, caregiver burden is a theoretical construct. The conceptual basis for the appraisal of the care situation is the Transactional Model of Lazarus and Folkman.\nThe subjective evaluation of the care situation (stressor) by the caregivers is critical for the development and maintenance of subjective burden.\n\nAccording to the Transactional Model, people deal with stressful situations by appraisals of stressor and resources. The primary appraisal deals with the individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual coping efforts are used to deal with the stressful situation. As per Carver, these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don\u2019t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).\n\nThe (dis)balance between burden/vulnerabilities and resources of the caregiver determines the consequences of a care situation. Home care can result in positive as well as negative experiences.\n\nRegardless of the caregiver burden, relatives can experience benefits - positive consequences - of the home care situation. This may be the feeling of being needed or the knowledge that they have acquired new skills etc.\n\nTriggers for caregiver burden \nCaregiver burden comes out when the caregiver perceives the home care situation as a negative experience. Caregivers are typically not trained. Caring is a serious challenge for them. An intensive adaptiation to the care situation is necessary.\n\nThe caregiver burden can be based on a variety of aspects of the care situation (e.g. lack of recovery time, challenging behavior of the care requiring person, limitation of social activities and contacts). Studies showed that four aspects are particularly burdensome:\n Care costs much energy\n Desire for recovery\n Too little time for own interests\n Sadness over the fate of the supported person\n\nMeaning of subjective burden \nNegative outcomes are often not determined by the specifics of the caregiving situation itself, but by the reaction and response of the caregiver. The term \u201ccaregiver burden\u201d refers to the high level of stress that some caregivers may feel in response to the situation. Because the caregiver burden may be felt strongly by one person and not at all by another, regardless of the caregiving situation, it is considered to be subjective and it may be called the \u201csubjective burden\u201d. The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation.\n\nImpact on health \nPinquart and S\u00f6rensen (2003) researched the health of caregivers compared to the health of non-caregiving relatives. The researchers found that while caregivers are generally only slightly less physically healthy than non-caregiving relatives, they reported depressive symptoms significantly more often, pointing to a negative effect on their mental health.\n\nThis meta-analysis did not consider the impact of subjective burden. In another extensive meta-analysis Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen could show that the subjective burden is an important predictor of the health of carers.\n\nRisk of mortality \nStudies found an increased mortality of caregiving spouses. This effect was only found for spouses who felt burdened due to the care situation. Thus, it is not the home care per se that is a risk but the subjective burden.\n\nWithout consideration of the caregiver burden, the mortality of caregivers is even slightly reduced compared to non-caregivers.\n\nCaring style \nPeople who experience caregiver burden can display a wide range of behaviors towards the person in need of care, from loving devotion to abusive behavior (which can manifest as neglect and/or mistreatment). The most common form of abusive behavior is verbal aggression, mainly due to challenging behaviour of the person in need of care. Researchers found that people experiencing caregiver burden are more likely to display abusive behavior and other negative caring styles toward the individuals  they care for than those who are not experiencing caregiver burden.\n\nEnding home care \nThe caregiver burden often influences the caregiver\u2019s decision to eventually institutionalize (or, \u201cput someone in a nursing home\u201d. Caregiver burden is particularly associated with the care of people with dementia, meaning that the likelihood of institutionalization is especially heightened in those experiencing caregiver burden who care for people suffering from dementia. In the care of people with dementia, there is consistent evidence: The higher the caregiver burden, the more likely is the institutionalization.\n\nMeasuring caregiver burden \nThe assessment of caregiver burden enables to judge the situation of the caregiver. The correct measurement of subjective burden is necessary to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of family interventions.\n\nThe care situation is an important, highly specific stressor which should be treated with specific interventions. A measurement with general stress-scales is therefore not useful, because in this case the score represents all kind of stress, indiscriminately of its origin. Valid, economic and internationally standardized measurement tools for the specific stressful situation of family caregivers are therefore inevitable.\n\nIn Anglo-American countries, a number of burden scales have been developed; e.g. the Burden Interview, the Caregiver Strain Index and the Cost of Care Index. The Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, which has been developed in Germany, is now available in 20 languages.\n\nBurden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC) \nThe BSFC exists in a detailed version with 28 items, and in a short, more efficient version (BFSC-s) with ten items.\n\nCompared to other burden scales, the BSFC has two benefits. There is a long and a short version, both validated in separate studies. Furthermore, both versions are free in 20 languages inclusive introduction for evaluation and interpretation.\n\nDevelopment \nA first, reliable and valid version of the German version was published in 1993. In 2001, the validity was tested and confirmed to a large sample of both dementia and for other causes of care requirement again. In 2003, the English version has been validated. In 2014, the validation study for the short version and an extended validation of the original version have been published.\n\nScale \nThe BSFC consists of 28 items in the detailed or 10 items in the short version. The caregivers have to rate these items on a four-point scale from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d.\n\nAn evaluation is possible both on item level and on score level. A differentiated detection of the critical aspects of home care is possible with the analysis on item level. The score measures the total burden. This is an important factor to judge the caregiver's situation.\n\nCaregivers\u00b4 Daily Issues (CDIs) \nThe CDIs is dealing with 9 main issues of caregivers based on the topical analysis of caregivers\u00b4 social media communication. A longitudinal analysis of 100 dyads (caregiver vs person with Alzheimer disease) revealed following structure of issues.\n\nInterventions \nDue to the high importance of the caregiver burden with regard to the care giving process, it is necessary to develop interventions to reduce this burden and to examine their effectiveness. Successful interventions should be available to as many caregivers as possible. \"The usefulness of an intervention is the multiplication of effectiveness and usage.\u201d (Elmar Gr\u00e4\u00dfel) It is therefore both necessary to develop interventions and to improve and to find ways to strengthen the awareness and use of these interventions.\n\nInterventions and services\nUnburdening interventions for caregivers should consider four central aspects:\n Information and training\n Professional support\n Effective communication\n Public and financial support\nThere are different supporting services, e.g. caregiver counselling, professional training, self-help groups, ambulant nursing services or technical help like intelligent light to preserve the autonomy of the person in need of care.\n\nAnother effective relief is the support given to caregivers by family members, friends and acquaintances. They provide emotional and instrumental support and are an important source to access supporting services.\n\nA 2021 Cochrane review found that remotely delivered interventions including support, training and information may reduce the burden for the informal caregiver and improve their depressive symptoms. However, there is no certain evidence that they improve health-related quality of life. The findings are based on moderate certainty evidence from 26 studies.\n\nImplications to strengthen and develop the informal caregiving\n Services should be made better known.\n The regional availability of support services should be made increased.\n Case management services should increase the effectivity of unburdening concepts.\n Public financial support should be made more available.\n The basic conditions of caregiving should allow the combination of care and occupation.\n Job conditions should be developed. No disadvantages should arise for caregivers who restrict the scope of their employment or temporarily give it up completely.\n Language barriers should be reduced. Low-threshold offers in information, counselling and support should be intercultural orientated.\n Internet based support should be extended.\n There is a lack of qualitative empirical studies on the impact of unburdening interventions. Evidence based health services research should focus on that point.\n\nReferences \n\nCaregiving\nNursing\nPsychological stress", "machine_text": " Caregiver burden is a term used to describe the physical, mental, and emotional stress experienced by family caregivers of a loved one who has a chronic health condition or disability. It can also be used to describe the financial and social burdens of a family caregiver. The term was first used by researchers in the 1970s to describe the fatigue, depression, fear, and social isolation that caregivers can experience while caring for another. Caregiver burden is associated with a number of health risks, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and sleep deprivation. Caregiver burden can also increase the risk of mortality. The increased burden due to caring for someone with a chronic condition or disability can make it difficult for a family caregiver to work, participate in leisure activities, or maintain healthy relationships with family and friends. Additionally, some caregivers may have to bear additional costs, such as medical care, equipment, and home modifications. The extent and type of burden experienced by caregivers can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the type of care needed, the age, gender, and health of the caregiver, the type and severity of the illness or injury of the person being cared for, and the amount of support from family, friends, and community resources. In order to lessen caregiver burden, it is important for caregivers to have access to resources, such as respite care, home health care, support groups, and counseling services. It is also important for families and friends to provide support to caregivers. Additionally, caregivers should be encouraged to engage in self-care practices, such as exercise, getting enough sleep, eating well, and socializing with friends. Caregiver burden is an important issue in the health care field and should not be overlooked. Caregivers can benefit from access to the resources they need to help reduce their burden and make caring for loved ones a bit easier. Additionally, health care providers can play a role in helping reduce caregiver burden by providing caregivers with education and resources to help them cope with their responsibilities and stress.

U-546 had a displacement of  when at the surface and  while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of  for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two  propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of  and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for  at ; when surfaced, she could travel  at . U-546 was fitted with six  torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one  SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a  SK C/30 as well as a  C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.\n\nSensors\n\nRadar\nU-546 was one of the few U-boats that was fitted with a FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U Radar Transmitter. It was installed on the starboard side of the conning tower.\n\nRadar Detection\nU-546 was fixed with the FuMB-26 Tunis antenne. The FuMB 26 Tunis combined the FuMB Ant. 24 Fliege and FuMB Ant. 25 Cuba II antennas. It could be mounted in either the Direction Finder Antenna Loop and separately on the bridge.\n\nService history\n\nShe commenced her training on 2 June 1943, making her first silent run at S\u00f8nderborg, she remained with the 4th U-boat Flotilla (training) at Stettin until 31 December 1943. She completed her training with a voyage from Hela to Swinem\u00fcnde to practice A.A. cannon fire.\n\nFirst patrol\nThe boat was reassigned to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for combat duties in the Atlantic on 1 January 1944, departing Kiel on 22 January 1944, with a three-day stopover at Marvika in Norway. After forming up with the Gruppe Igel 1 (Group Hedgehog) north-west of Scotland on 3 February 1944, U-546 commenced a patrol in the North Atlantic with other boats to the west of Ireland on anti-convoy duties. At 12:29 on 16 February U-546 reported she had been attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat from No. 201 Squadron RAF, killing one crewman. On 20 February 1944 she was again attacked by an aircraft. On 17 April while returning to base in France, the U-boat was caught on the surface by a Leigh light -equipped Liberator of 53 Squadron in the Bay of Biscay, steaming south-east, ahead of convoy HX 278 and was attacked with depth charges, but ended up shooting down the attacker with the 3.7\u00a0cm gun. She returned to Lorient for service and refit on 23 or 25 April 1944. The crew was given leave while the boat was overhauled and the Schnorchel was fitted.\n\nSecond patrol\nLeaving her base again on 15 June 1944 for her second patrol to the African Gold Coast, she was detected by a USN anti-submarine patrol, which begun to hunt her. She soon had to abort her patrol and was ordered to return to Germany after the invasion of Normandy. On 18 June 1944 U-546 was attacked, again by a Sunderland, which was not equipped with radar. The boat then briefly returned to France on 22 June to replenish her cannon ammunition, sailing again on 25 June. On 20 July 1944 she was detected by USN surface ships forming the escort for an escort carrier; U-546 fired a torpedo at the carrier, but missed and was subjected to three hours of depth charge attacks from the escort destroyers. She managed to escape this attack. U-546 was then ordered to patrol a zone near Cape Verde where she operated for about four weeks, attacking a convoy with a spread of three torpedoes, but scoring no hits.\n\nDuring the second patrol due to fuel shortages the captain achieved significant fuel saving and extended the cruise to 150 days (the boat's longest patrol), by floating submerged for days on water-layers with all engines stopped. The boat returned to base with 30 metric tons of fuel left.\n\nThird patrol\nOn 10 November 1944 U-546 was reassigned to the 33rd U-boat Flotilla based at Flensburg, where she received a 14-day overhaul, eventually departing Kristiansand in Norway, on 2 March 1945. The boat proceeded to the eastern coast of North America on 10 March 1945 with six companions. In mid-April the group was ordered to commence operations individually. On 23 April the submarine was spotted surfacing north-west of the Azores by aircraft from  as part of Operation Teardrop. The planes were looking for U-boats carrying V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, which intelligence suggested were going to be used to attack American cities. Depth charges were dropped just after the boat submerged, but failed to damage her hull.\n\nSinking\n\nOn 24 April 1945, U-546 made contact with the destroyer escort  and proceeded to attack, firing a stern torpedo. The destroyer turned into it and was hit, which tore the DE apart and sent her down with heavy loss of life.\n\nThe U-boat was in turn pursued by other destroyer escorts; , , , , ,  , , and . Neunzer and  conducted a search while Pillsbury circled the area and Flaherty picked up survivors. Flaherty made contact in less than an hour and with Pillsbury proceeded to attack. The U-boat went to . Contact was lost from 10:45 until 12:01 when Varian, Janssen and Hubbard began another attack. Neunzer got into the fight after several attacks by the other DE's, delivering a creeping attack with Varian and Hubbard while Chatelain directed. Contact was lost once more at about 16:00, so Chatelain and Neunzer were ordered to return to the scouting line.\n\nThe line was expanded, the ships began a sweep through the area, determined to prevent the submarine's escape. Varian made contact once more at 17:31 and Flaherty was ordered to attack. She fired at 18:10. Four minutes later a small oil slick began coming to the surface. Flaherty made another Hedgehog attack at 18:28, and at 18:38 the U-boat broke the surface.\n\nEvery ship in the line within range began firing. At 18:44, after more than ten and a half hours of attacks, U-546 rolled under and sank (in position , south-south-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland). Her captain and most of her crew were rescued by US vessels, and taken to Argentia Naval Station, Newfoundland. Eight of the surviving, captured crewmen of U-546 were tortured by US military personnel. Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U-546's survivors was a singular atrocity motivated by the interrogators' need to quickly get information on what the U.S. believed were potential cruise missile or ballistic missile attacks on the continental US by German submarines. The USN eventually learned that no V-1/2 attacks from the U-boats were planned by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nWolfpacks\nU-546 took part in three wolfpacks, namely:\n Igel 1 (9 \u2013 17 February 1944) \n Hai 1 (17 \u2013 22 February 1944) \n Seewolf (14 \u2013 24 April 1945)\n\nSummary of raiding history\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nY'Blood, William T., Hunter-killer : U.S. escort carriers in the Battle of the Atlantic, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 1983. \nSyrett, David, Failure at Sea: Wolf Pack Operations in the North Atlantic, 10 February-22 March 1944 \"The Northern Mariner\", V, No. 1 (January 1995), 33\u201343.\n\nFurther reading\nNiestle, Axel, German U-Boat Losses During World War II. 1998.\nBlair, Clay, Hitler's U-boat War, 1996.\nBlair, Clay, Hitler's U-boat War, Vol II, 1998.\nWynn, Kenneth, U-Boat Operations of the Second World War \u2013 Vol 1, 1998.\nWynn, Kenneth, U-Boat Operations of the Second World War \u2013 Vol 2, 1998.\nJust, Paul, Vom Seeflieger zum U-Boot-Fahrer, 1982.\n\nExternal links\n\nGerman Type IX submarines\nWorld War II submarines of Germany\nU-boats sunk in 1945\nU-boats sunk by US warships\nWorld War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean\nU-boats commissioned in 1943\n1943 ships\nShips built in Hamburg\nMaritime incidents in April 1945", "machine_text": " German submarine U-546 was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down on 15 October 1940 at the Deutsche Werke (commonly known as Kriegsmarinewerft) yard at Kiel, launched on 17 August 1941, commissioned on 7 November, and commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Henrich Bleichrodt. U-546 had a short career and conducted four combat patrols, sinking two merchant ships of 7,028 long tons (7,150 t). She was a member of six wolfpacks. U-546s first patrol began 15 April 1942 when she departed Kiel for the North Atlantic. She sank a Greek and an Italian merchant ship totaling over 6,000 long ton (6,100 t). During the patrol, she was part of a temporary breakaway wolf pack named Pfadfinder that sank the British Armed Merchant Cruiser HMS Voltaire. The second patrol started 19 December 1942 and lasted until the end of March 1943. U-546 was part of five wolfpacks, Kreuzotter, Oder, Hauptmann Stegmann, Steubens and Kurf\u00fcrst. She had no success. U-546s third patrol began 11 June 1943 when she left St. Nazaire, France, and headed for the North Atlantic. The wolfpacks in which U-546 operated included Albin, Eisb\u00e4r, Benecke, and Neuland. U-546 torpedoed and sank the Norwegian freighter SS Arosa on 23 June 1943 while en route to Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. U-546s fourth and final patrol began on 24 February 1944 and ended on 25 April. While patrolling in the North Atlantic and north of Ireland, she was part of two wolf packs, Jagd and Drossel. U-546 sank one British merchant ship of over 1,000 long ton (1,016 t) in the Bay of Biscay before heading back to Germany. On 25 April 1944 U-546 was spotted by a British aircraft north of Spain and depth-charged by the British destroyers HMS Liddesdale and HMS Obdurate. U-546 sunk to the bottom and her entire crew of 48 sailors was lost. After the war her wreck was found off Finisterre where it has been determined by experts from Spain\u2019s Naval War College that she was attacked by a combination of aerial and surface torpedo attacks based on a thorough analysis of the wreckage. It has been identfied as U-546 due to the presence of the U-boat's number on the remains. ", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24270142}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh,  (26 November 1937 \u2013 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.\n\nMoore was particularly noted for his \"filmstar good looks\" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.\n\nMoore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as \"Mr Privatisation\". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.\n\nMoore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.\n\nEarly life\nMoore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.\n\nHe enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a \"precinct captain\". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.\n\nMoore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.\n\nIn October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being \"an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36\".\n\nEarly political career\nCroydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.\n\nMoore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife \"... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food....\" He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;\n\nHandsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.\n\nMargaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was \"youth\". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.\n\nAfter the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as \"Mr Privatisation\".\n\nCabinet career\nMoore joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.\n\n... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered \"sharp, nasty \u2013 and effective\".\n\nBy now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The journalist Brian Walden wrote \"... he has future Tory leader written all over him\". After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's \u00a366\u00a0billion annual spend, and the payment of over \u00a350\u00a0billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.\n\nHowever, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore's earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, \"The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines\". Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for \"a good-looking fellow\" when it came to making government appointments. \"Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job.\" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.\n\nOnce established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the USA in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.\n\nMoore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be \"a soft touch\". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being \"useless\". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: \"It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do\". Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore's wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.\n\nA 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.\n\nIn November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to \u00a32,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated \"How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?\".\n\nEnd of political career\nAfter two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.\n\nMoore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.\n\nHe was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.\n\nHe gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.\n\nAfter leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech. Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates.\n\nWhile he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed\n\nArms\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1937 births\n2019 deaths\nAlumni of the London School of Economics\nBritish Secretaries of State\nEnglish stockbrokers\nConservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nConservative Party (UK) life peers\nMembers of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom\nPeople educated at Licensed Victuallers' School\nPeople from Kentish Town\nPolitics of the London Borough of Croydon\nSecretaries of State for Transport (UK)\nUK MPs 1974\nUK MPs 1974\u20131979\nUK MPs 1979\u20131983\nUK MPs 1983\u20131987\nUK MPs 1987\u20131992\nSecretaries of State for Health and Social Services\n20th-century English businesspeople", "machine_text": " John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh (born 28 January 1945) is a British Conservative politician and hereditary peer.

It received this conservation status because the waterbody has remained close to its natural state due to its steep river banks and is a habitat for a range of rare plants and animals. It covers an area of . In addition to the section of river it includes an oxbow lake, a tributary, hedgerows, wooded river banks and slopes, rich in herbs, and small ponds.\n\nThe Schwentine valley, in which the nature reserve lies, was formed from a chain of dead-icefields that were left behind after the last ice age. After they had melted a chain of dammed-up lakes was formed and, when the water forced its way out, the present river valley of the Schwentine emerged.\n\nFauna \nAmongst the animal species occurring in the nature reserve are fish such as the trout, bleak, burbot and stickleback. It is also home to the blue-tailed damselfly and the emerald dragonfly. Native bird species include the kingfisher, grey wagtail and white-throated dipper. The first two breed in the nature reserve, whilst the dipper only rests and overwinters. In the ponds amongst the grasslands there are amphibians like the common toad, smooth newt, water frog, common frog and moor frog as well as grass snakes. The hedgerows are used by many animals including the red-backed shrike, great spotted woodpecker and tawny owl.\n\nFlora \nIn the near-natural riparian woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring yellow wood anemone, bulbous corydalis and lesser celandine blossom in the woods. Opposite-leaved golden saxifrage and primrose grow on the wetter tracts of the nature reserve. There are also marsh marigold meadows which are also graced by flowers such as the western marsh orchid, water avens and goldilocks buttercup.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n Landesamt f\u00fcr Natur und Umwelt des Landes Schleswig-Holstein (Hrsg): einzigartig \u2013 Naturf\u00fchrer durch Schleswig Holstein, Wachholtz Verlag, Neum\u00fcnster 2008, \n\nNature reserves in Schleswig-Holstein\nOxbow lakes", "machine_text": " Schwentine Oxbow Lake is a natural lake located near the town of Eutin, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Located near the Schwentine River, the Oxbow Lake is a popular recreational spot for both locals and visitors alike. It is home to a variety of fish, amphibians, and aquatic plants. The lake is approximately 3,500 meters long and 500 meters wide, making it one of the largest bodies of water in Schleswig-Holstein. The Schwentine Oxbow Lake formed when the river changed its course, creating a meander or oxbow lake in the process. The lake was formed 10,000 years ago and is significantly older than the nearby towns of Eutin, Kiel, and L\u00fcbeck. The lake is home to a variety of fish, including pike, perch, roach, rudd, bream and tench. Fishermen often come to the lake to try their luck. The lake is also home to numerous amphibians, such as frogs and salamanders. Aquatic plants such as reed and giant bur-reed are also abundant. Many of these plants are protected and their harvest is prohibited. The lake is a popular destination for locals and visitors alike. Surrounding the lake is a cycling and walking path that provides beautiful views. The lake has also become a popular spot for boating, canoeing and paddleboarding. Swimmers also frequent the lake during the summer months. The oxbow lake is home to many types of birds, including ducks, geese and swans. Many types of aquatic birds, such as kingfishers, can also be seen near the lake. In recent years, the Schwentine Oxbow Lake has become a popular spot for nature education. Local schools often organize field trips to the lake, to allow students to experience and learn about nature. The Schwentine River is an important source of renewable energy in the region. The nearby hydropower plant is run by the Schwentine Energy Company and is one of the most important sources of electricity in Schleswig-Holstein. In 2019, the Schwentine Oxbow Lake was designated as a Nature Reserve. This designation protects the lake's unique ecology and ensures that it will remain a vibrant part of the local natural environment for years to come.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28545012}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a song by English pop rock band Tears for Fears. It was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley, and Chris Hughes and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by Phonogram, Mercury, and Vertigo Records as the third single from the band's second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985). \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a new wave and synth-pop song with lyrics that detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of corruption.\n\nMusic critics praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" in their retrospective reviews, with some ranking the song among the decade's best. Along with \"Shout\" (1984), it is one of the band's signature songs. An international success, the song peaked at number two in Ireland, Australia, and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox. It was certified gold by both Music Canada (MC) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\n\nNigel Dick directed the music video, which received promotion from MTV. It shows bassist Curt Smith (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique Austin-Healey 3000 sports car around Southern California intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the Sport Aid campaign.\n\nBackground and release\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley and Chris Hughes, and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of Songs from the Big Chair (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes. It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, the final line in the song's chorus, originally written as \"Everybody wants to go to war\", contributed to his indifference towards the track.\n\nIn an interview with Mix magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell.\" Orzabal's unimpressed reaction to the track during their songwriting sessions prompted Hughes to convince him to record it, in a calculated effort to garner American chart success. After completing their sessions at 6p.m., they would spend an hour reviewing each recording many times; this helped Orzabal to create the song's guitar figure and change its title. Orzabal acknowledged that the shuffle beat used in the song was \"alien\" to their way of writing music, stating it was \"jolly rather than square and rigid in the manner of 'Shout', but it continued the process of becoming more extrovert.\" Curt Smith, the song's lead singer, said the themes were \"quite serious \u2013 it's about everybody wanting power, about warfare and the misery it causes.\"\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was first released on 18 March 1985 through Phonogram, Mercury and Vertigo Records as the third single from the band's second studio album, Songs from the Big Chair. The song was released for sale (as a 7-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch vinyl set) which included its B-side, interviews from the band and different versions of the song. To accommodate the vinyl release, a CD video set was also distributed and included the song's music video along audios of bonus tracks.\n\nComposition and lyrical interpretation\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a new wave and synth-pop song. The song is set in the key of D major with a  time signature and a tempo of 116 beats per minute. The band stated that the driving shuffle rhythm was influenced by Simple Minds' 1983 song \"Waterfront\", and Linx's 1981 song \"Throw Away the Key\". \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" incorporates synthesizers, guitar, a shuffle groove, two guitar solos, and keyboards.\n\nThe song's lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power. In 2017, Tal Rosenberg of Pitchfork stated that its lyrics could be applied in different scenarios such as the environment (\"Turn your back on mother nature\"), short-lived financial success (\"Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure/Nothing ever lasts forever\"), dictatorial rule (\"Even while we sleep/We will find you\"), and the Cold War (\"Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down\").\n\nThe song's lyrics have elicited different political interpretations. The Economist writer K.Y.W. called the track a Cold War anthem and noted its timeless message, stating that \"the song's lyrics speak to the anxieties of every age.\" Marc Ambinder from The Atlantic used the lyrics \"Say that you'll never, never, never need it / One headline, why believe it? / Everybody wants to rule the world\" in his article about the United States government's use of \"original classified authority\" and the abuse of power between the branches of government. Dominic Pino of National Review described the track as a \"conservative pop song\", noting the lyrics' tension between \"personal ambition\" and \"channeling that personal ambition to good ends\", comparing these themes to James Madison's concerns about private interest in the Federalist Papers. Curt Smith challenged this interpretation.\n\nTears for Fears revisited the song and its message in a 2017 interview with Yahoo! Music, stating that the song's themes were still \"just as poignant\" as they were when they first wrote it. They mentioned that they discussed the Cold War with \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and Songs from the Big Chair but that was the \"U.S. and Russia then, and now the concern is more with the U.S. and [North] Korea.\"\n\nReception\nConsequence of Sound editor Michael Roffman praised the group for being able to produce a \"timeless and influential composition\" with minimal effort. Roffman also noted that \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was appropriate when it was first released, calling it a \"meditative commentary on an era that was so corrupt economically and spiritually.\" AllMusic's Stanton Swihart expressed in his retrospective review that the group \"perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the mid-'80s while impossibly managing to also create a dreamy, timeless pop classic.\" Pitchfork called it a song with \"near-universal appeal\", as well as a staple for \"classic-rock radio, pharmacies, bars, and parties.\" In their review for the best albums of the 1980s, Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine stated that the song \"seems like one of the great indictments of the materialism and false triumphalism of the decade.\"\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was voted the 25th best single in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1985 with 17 points, sharing the spot with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' \"Don't Come Around Here No More\" (1985) and Sade's \"Smooth Operator\" (1984). Pitchfork placed the song at number 82 on their list for the best songs of the 80s expressing that \"underneath the synth-pop sheen, its vague message\" and its lesson in how power-driven society could be, the song was able to reach \"Reagan and Margaret-era youth fed up with political greed.\" Kevin Korber from Spectrum Culture ranked the song at 24 on his 80s decade list, calling the song a \"testament to how much of a free-for-all the pop landscape was in the 1980s.\" Korber dismissed the song's vague lyrics but praised its complex melodic structure, saying it was \"both the perfect representation of its time and a timeless composition.\" Treble included the song at number 49 on their decade list. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 319 in their updated list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIn 1986, the song won \"Best Single\" at the Brit Awards. Band member and co-writer Roland Orzabal argued that the song deserved to win the Ivor Novello International Hit of the Year award, claiming that the winner\u2014\"19\" by Paul Hardcastle\u2014was not an actual song, but only a \"dialogue collage\". In 2015, 30 years after its release, the song was honoured at the annual BMI Awards in London for achieving 6 million radio airplays. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is regarded as the group's signature song, along with \"Shout\" (1984).\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was banned for broadcast by the BBC for the duration of the first Gulf War (2 August 199028 February 1991) due to the song's political themes.\n\nTears For Fears played the song live on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d the night Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nCommercial performance\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" debuted at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, in the issue dated 24 March 1985. On the week of 14 April 1985, the song peaked at number two. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" received a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 13 April 2018 for 500,000 sales. The song peaked at number three in Belgium, and at number two in both the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nIn the United States, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" debuted at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the issue dated 16 March 1985. On the week of 27 April 1985, the song rose to number 18. On the week of 8 June 1985, the song moved 2\u20131, replacing Wham!'s \"Everything She Wants\" (1984) as the number one on the chart; it would spend a total of two weeks in this position. The song was a commercial success in other American markets, peaking at number two on the Adult Contemporary and Top Rock Tracks and charting at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play, Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, and Cash Box charts. It ranks as the 345th best-charting single of all time in the United States. In Canada, the song reached the number one spot, earning a gold certification from Music Canada (MC) for 40,000 sales shipments on 1 May 1985.\n\nIn Australia, the song reached the number two position. On the report dated 19 May 1985, the song debuted at number four on the New Zealand Top 40 Singles chart; it would later peak at number one. It was certified Gold by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for sales of 10,000.\n\nB-side: \"Pharaohs\"\n\n\"Pharaohs\" is the B-side to the \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" single. It samples a recording of BBC Radio 4 announcer Brian Perkins reading the Shipping Forecast for the North Sea region of the United Kingdom. The title of the song has an identical enunciation to the Faroe Islands (\"Faroes\"), one of the places referenced in the forecast. Orzabal, Ian Stanley, Curt Smith and Hughes share writing credits. \"Pharaohs\" is included on the Groove Armada compilation album Back to Mine (2000). Chris Hughes wrote about the song in the liner notes of Saturnine Martial & Lunatic (1996), saying:\n\n\"Pharaohs\" shipping forecast read by Brian Perkins:\n\nMusic video\n\nThe promotional video for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", filmed in early 1985, was directed by Nigel Dick. It was filmed in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, a desert in Southern California, the Salton Sea and Cabazon as well as a London studio. Curt Smith admitted to Pitchfork that the video shoot was a \"disaster\"; Dick was \"in tears\" on the second night of shooting. Smith also mentioned that there was an accident while filming the \"dirt bikes and four-wheel  off-road vehicles\" scene, with one child flying out of a vehicle and smashing his head, leaving him unconscious.\n\nThe video begins with Smith driving a vintage Austin-Healey 3000 sports car while a toddler points toy guns in Smith's direction. The car is then seen driving through a desert, this scene is intercut with the band performing the song in a studio. Smith parks the car at the Wheel Inn diner and makes a call from a telephone booth. The camera pans to show a statue of a man riding a horse nearby. Smith leaves the diner in the car while singing the song's lyrics. The following scene shows two black men in suits performing synchronised dance movements in front of two gas pumps. Shots of young people riding three-wheeled ATVs and dirt bikes through desert sand dunes are also shown. Smith is then shown singing in the desert wearing black sunglasses as many of the dirt bike and ATV riders approach from behind him and pass to either side.\n\nThe music video promoted the group in America, due to \"heavy rotation\" on the music video channel MTV. HuffPost editor Daryl Deino ranked the video at number three on their year-end list for best music videos of 1985 stating that the video \"represents pure Americana as it was in 1985\". Deino also mentioned that the video \"proves that at times, artists were able to do so much with so little.\"\n\nFormats and track listings\n\n7\": Mercury / IDEA 9 (UK)\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\"4:11\nB. \"Pharaohs\" 3:42\n\nDouble 7\" Special Limited Edition: Mercury / IDEA 99 (UK)\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" 4:11\nB. \"Pharaohs\" 3:42\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Urban Mix) 6:06\nB. \"Roland & Curt Interviewed\" 7:30\n\n10\": Mercury / IDEA 910 (UK)\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" 4:11\nB. \"Pharaohs\" 3:42\n\n12\": Mercury / IDEA 912 (UK)\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Extended Version) 5:43\nB1. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (7\" Version) 4:11\nB2. \"Pharaohs\" 3:42\n\nUrban Mix 12\": Mercury / IDEA 912 (UK)\nA. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Urban Mix) 6:06\nB. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Instrumental) 4:26\n\nCD Video: Mercury / 080 032-2 (UK, PAL)\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Audio) 4:10\n\"The Marauders\" (Audio) 4:13\n\"When in Love With a Blind Man\" (Audio) 2:22\n\"Pharaohs\" (Audio) 3:39\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Video) 4:41\n\nCD Video: Mercury / 870 745-2 (US, NTSC)\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Audio) 4:10\n\"The Marauders\" (Audio) 4:13\n\"When in Love With a Blind Man\" (Audio) 2:22\n\"Pharaohs\" (Audio) 3:39\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (Video) 4:41\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Saturnine Martial & Lunatic and Mix.\n\nTears for Fears\nRoland Orzabal guitar, keyboards, vocals\nCurt Smith keyboard bass, lead vocals\nIan Stanley keyboards, LinnDrum programming, Oberheim DMX\nManny Elias drums, Oberheim DMX\n\nAdditional personnel\nNeil Taylor electric and acoustic guitar\nChris Hughes producer, drums, Oberheim DMX, MIDI programming\nDave Bascombe engineer\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nAll-time charts\n\nCertifications and sales\n\nCovers and re-releases\n\nEverybody Wants to Run the World\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Run the World\" is a re-recording of the band's song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\". The reworked single was released in 1986 as the theme song for the Sport Aid campaign, a charitable event held to raise money for famine relief in Africa. It was a success in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's sixth top 5 hit, peaking at number 5 in June 1986. The song also reached number 4 in Ireland.\n\nLorde version\n\nNew Zealand singer Lorde recorded a cover of the song for the soundtrack of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). The cover was produced by Peter Shurkin and Natalie Baartz with arrangement by Michael A. Levine and Lucas Cantor. It was later used in the cinematic trailer of Assassin's Creed Unity at E3 2014, promotional videos for the BBC First network, and the 2015 BBC TV series Banished. It was also used during season 4 of Homeland. Orzabal praised Lorde for reinventing the cover, stating that the group finds it interesting when artists take what they do and reinterpret it. For their Rule the World Tour, the duo uses this version to launch their show.\n\nCritics were positively receptive to the cover, some praised it for its darker atmosphere mood although others criticized it for stripping away the song's original upbeat composition. David Haglund from Slate stated that while the song \"doesn't top the great original, it does memorably reinvent it.\" Sam Lansky from Idolator called the cover \"haunting and melodramatic\". Conversely, Stereogum editor Nate Patrin criticized the chorus and production but praised the \"aloof strangeness\" in Lorde's vocals for being able to carry the song \"past the usual Dramatic Reenvisionings.\" Paste included the cover at number 8 on their 2013 year-end list for covers. Her cover appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 14. It reached number 53 in Australia, number 65 in the United Kingdom, number 93 in France, and number 27 on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\nWeekly charts\n\nCertifications\n\nSee also\nList of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1985\nList of Cash Box Top 100 number-one singles of 1985\nList of number-one dance singles of 1985 (U.S.)\nList of number-one singles of 1985 (Canada)\nList of number-one singles from the 1980s (New Zealand)\n\nReferences\n\n1985 songs\n1985 singles\n1986 singles\nTears for Fears songs\nLorde songs\nBillboard Hot 100 number-one singles\nCashbox number-one singles\nNumber-one singles in New Zealand\nRPM Top Singles number-one singles\nBrit Award for British Single\nMusic videos directed by Nigel Dick\nPhonogram Records singles\nMercury Records singles\nVertigo Records singles\nRepublic Records singles\nSongs written by Ian Stanley\nSongs written by Roland Orzabal\nThe Hunger Games music\nSignature songs\nSong recordings produced by Chris Hughes (record producer)", "machine_text": " \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a 1985 single released by British pop band Tears for Fears. Written by Roland Orzabal and Ian Stanley, it was the standout track from their second album, Songs from the Big Chair. The single was an international success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada, Ireland, Norway, Belgium, and South Africa. It was also on the top 20 in Australia, Italy, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the top 10 in several other countries. It reached the no.1 spot on the UK Singles Chart on the week beginning 3 June 1985 and held the number one position for three weeks. Described as a \"massive '80s hit\", \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" moves from a mid-tempo gothic beat to an anthemic chorus driven by a powerful synth-line. Its lyrics speak of oppression; Orzabal has said he was influenced by the political commentary of his former university English professor, Tom Harrison. The song has become a much-covered standard, with over 60 different versions recorded. Apart from its chart success, the song is also known for its place in popular culture. It has featured in numerous films such as Rock of Ages, D.A.R.Y.L., and Napoleon Dynamite. It has also been used in commercials for Captain Morgan, Cadillac, and Dr Pepper, as well as television shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy. The song was used during the introduction of the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In a 1998 interview to promote the greatest hits collection Tears Roll Down, Orzabal said of the song: \"I like it. I think lyrically it's one of the strongest I've ever written. It's quite a broad statement but it's a very general feel as well. In the days of Thatcher it was quite relevant. I mean, even now, a lot of stuff that's gone on makes you feel like everybody wants to rule the world. It's quite a defiant statement, considering the band were never really seen as political songwriters. Although I must say I've never seen us as apolitical either.\" The song has been nominated multiple times for various awards, including a 1985 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, and an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling A-Side. It has also been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, the song was ranked no. 90 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, as well as no. 6 on Q magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2020, Rolling Stone also listed the song at no. 5 on its list of The 50 Best Pop Songs of 1985.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2756730}

Both ships built in 1903 were the largest and most luxurious liners built in the United States at the opening of the 20th century. The passenger telephone system, another was installed for ship's use, was advertised by the manufacturer, Electric Gas Lighting Company of Boston, to be the largest shipboard installation.\n\nMinnesota was sold in January 1917 to the Atlantic Transport Company of West Virginia, part of J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, reaching New York in March where she was armed in accordance with measures authorized for merchant ships and received a U.S. Navy armed guard gun crew. The ship was in English waters when the United States declared war and made seven wartime round trips. During one of the New York port calls the ship was inspected and accepted for U.S. Navy use assigned the identification number 1614 until the end of hostilities whereupon the armament and naval personnel were removed. \n\nThe Navy chartered Minnesota to bring troops home, renamed the ship Troy and placed her in commission at the Army's Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y., on 27 February 1919 under the command of Lt.

It was built for the Atlantic Transport Line of Liverpool, and was originally intended to be used as a cargo and passenger ship. The Minnesota was initially registered in Liverpool, but was later registered in London. The SS Minnesota was a four-masted steel steamship, 403.5 feet long by 56.1 feet wide and had a gross tonnage of 9,084. It was propelled by a four steam-cylinder triple expansion engine and a single screw, and was also fitted with three masts for sailing purposes. Its maiden voyage was from London to New York City on April 14, 1904. The Minnesota was popularly known as the \"Queen of the Atlantic.\" It was named after both a state in the United States and a Dakota Sioux Tribe. It was the flagship of the Atlantic Transport Line, and the most luxurious ship of its time, featuring the first heated pool on an ocean liner, as well as four elevators, Turkish baths, gymnasium, and lovely saloons. Many of the original furnishings, decorative woodwork, hand-painted glass panels, and a bronze fountain with four cherubs still survived in the ship until shortly before its demolition in 1981. The SS Minnesota served as an immigration ship during World War I, carrying thousands of soldiers to the front in Europe. After the war, it returned to its original purpose as a cargo and passenger ship, making regular trips to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. In 1927, its passenger service was suspended, and it became solely a cargo vessel until its retirement in 1960. The SS Minnesota's final voyage was to Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1960. In 1981 the ship was sold to a Dutch scrapyard, and was subsequently dismantled and scrapped. Much of the furniture, decorations, and other items originally on the ship were salvaged and taken to the Netherlands Maritime Museum. The Minnesota was a remarkable ship whose luxurious and advanced features set the tone for modern ocean liners.", "model": "text-davinci-003", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 54500362}
