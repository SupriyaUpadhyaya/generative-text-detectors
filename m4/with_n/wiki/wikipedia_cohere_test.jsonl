{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rhinoceros auklet\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus Cerorhinca. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.\n\nIt ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also processes fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.\n\nThe rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).\n\nDistribution\nThe rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaid\u014d and Honsh\u016b, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.\n\nBreeding\nBreeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30\u201335 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35\u201345 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.\n\nRhinoceros Auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.\n\nFeeding\nAt sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater.  To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187\u00a0ft) for as long as 148 seconds.\n\nDiet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird's nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.\n\nEvolution and prehistoric species\nThe genus Cerorhinca evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of Cerorhinca is more complex than previously thought. Known prehistoric species are:\n\n Dubious auklet, Cerorhinca dubia L. H. Miller, 1925 (Late Miocene of San Barbara County, USA)\n Cerorhinca minor Howard, 1971 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Cedros Island, Mexico)\n Cerorhinca reai Chandler, 1990 (San Diego Late Pliocene, North American Southwest)\n Cerorhinca aurorensis N. A. Smith, 2011, a nomen nudum, only published in a PhD dissertation (Yorktown Formation Late Pliocene, North Carolina, USA)\n Cerorhinca sp. (Early Pliocene, Southeastern Woodlands)\n\nBill fluorescence \nSince rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate. The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. Also, the bill interestingly has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light, which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Rhinoceros Auklet Images http://tsuru-bird.net/image.htm \u2013 Monte M.

It is one of three species of auklets in the genus Cerorhinca, and one of 21 species in the Alcidae family. The rhinoceros auklet is found from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia. It occurs as a breeder in Russia, North Korea, South Korea, China, and Japan; and as a winter migrant to the North Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California. It has also been recorded from Taiwan. The rhinoceros auklet is named for its distinctive horn-like bill. It is 20\u201323 cm (7.9\u20139.1 in) in length and weighs 100\u2013400 g (3.5\u201314 oz). It has a dark greyish-brown head, pale greyish-brown upperparts, and white underparts. The feet and legs are pale grey. The male and female are similar in appearance. The rhinoceros auklet feeds at night on small crustaceans and marine worms. It nests in colonies on islands and coastal headlands in Russia and North America. It winters in the open ocean and in protected coastal waters. The rhinoceros auklet is the subject of a conservation effort by BirdLife International.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Brad Lidge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bradley Thomas Lidge (born December 23, 1976) nicknamed \"Lights Out\" is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002\u20132012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge is currently a host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio.\n\nLidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95\u201397 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87\u00a0mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5.\n\nEarly life\nLidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School. Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek's outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign.\n\nCollege career\nLidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8\u20132 record and 93 strikeouts in  innings.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHouston Astros (2002\u20132007)\n\nEarly career\nLidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n2003\u201304\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA.\n\nFollowing the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.  Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, \"I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.\"\n\n2005\n\nIn his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984.\n\nLater in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0\u20132 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n2006\nLidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.\n\n2007 \nThe Astros avoided contract arbitration with Lidge on January 17, 2007, by signing him to a one-year contract worth $5.35 million. After seeing Lidge struggle in spring training and blow his first save of the season, manager Phil Garner chose to make Dan Wheeler the new Astros closer, while offering Lidge opportunities to relieve in the sixth or seventh innings of games. He regained the closer role at the start of June, but was placed on the disabled list that same month after suffering a strained left oblique muscle. Although Lidge described to reporters that the injury bothered him less towards the end of the day, Garner chose to shut his closer down in order to keep the muscle strain from becoming a larger issue.\n\nAfter returning to the active roster on July 13, Lidge picked up his first save of the season on July 18, against the Washington Nationals. With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, there was speculation that the Astros, who had the third-lowest record in the National League (NL) would trade Lidge, but owner Drayton McLane told reporters, \"I see no reason we should even consider it. He's been one of the best closers in baseball.\" Instead, the club traded Wheeler to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for infielder Ty Wigginton. Despite his early-season struggles and injuries, Lidge finished the 2007 season 5\u20133 with 19 saves in 27 opportunities. He also held his opponents to a .218 batting average and record and average of 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9). After the season, Lidge underwent surgery to repair a cartilage tear in his right knee, with the anticipation that he would be healthy for the beginning of spring training.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2008\u20132011)\n\n2008\n\nIn February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4\u20133.  \n \nOn September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies.  He is the first closer since \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.\n\nHe saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).\n\nLidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.\n\nHe received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award. Baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Closer of the Year. Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's Outstanding Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 26, 2009. He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News Sportsperson of the Year award.\n\nLidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.\n\n2009\nLidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in  innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee.\n\nAfter returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team's closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win-loss record of 0\u20138, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.\n\nIn the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8\u20136.  In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth inning.  He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5\u20134 victory.  Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7\u20134 win and a 3\u20131 lead in the series.  The Yankees went on to win the series in six games.\n\n2010\nLidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010, and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season. He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game.  On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAfter spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities.\n\n2011 \nAfter entering spring training fully healthy, Lidge was shut down on March 25 with pain in the back of his right shoulder, which he said was a new occurrence. An MRI revealed a posterior rotator cuff strain that did not require surgery, but would take three to six weeks to heal, and he began the 2011 MLB season on the disabled list. He underwent an eight-game rehab assignment with Lakewood and Reading, going 0\u20130 with a 3.52 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 7.2 innings before returning to the Phillies roster on July 22. Although his pitch velocity remained constant during Lidge's rehab appearances, with his fastball hovering around , Lidge and sports journalists alike voiced concerns over the pitcher's control: in one appearance for Reading, he threw only 15 strikes in 28 pitches.\n\nLidge did not return to the closer role even after coming off of the disabled list; instead, his setup man Ryan Madson filled the ninth inning, while Lidge found himself in competition with Antonio Bastardo over who would pitch the eighth. Despite seeing a decreased velocity on his fastball, Lidge found success in later innings with his slider, working up to an 11.29 K/9 by the end of September. Lidge's strong relationship with Madson helped both players adjust to their new positions. Lidge told reporters during the 2011 NLCS that, while Madson was closing, he would find himself \"shaking pitches off with [Madson]. I feel that I am there with him.\" Lidge played in 25 games during the 2011 season, during which he posted a 0\u20132 record with a 1.40 ERA and struck out 23 batters in  innings.\n\nWashington Nationals (2012) \n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Washington Nationals signed Lidge to a one-year, $1 million contract, plus additional incentives. He had not been signed as a closer for Washington, but after Drew Storen suffered from elbow inflammation during spring training, the team prepared to use Lidge and Henry Rodr\u00edguez in the ninth inning. The pair officially took over for Storen when the latter underwent surgery for a bone chip in his elbow. After allowing four earned runs in seven innings and blowing two saves, Lidge was placed on the disabled list with an abdominal wall strain. He was diagnosed with a sports hernia and underwent surgery on May 1, with an estimated recovery time of three weeks before he could begin throwing again. After pitching a perfect inning in a rehab assignment for the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals, Lidge was able to rejoin the Washington active roster on June 7, a week earlier than expected; he effectively replaced Rodr\u00edguez, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained finger. He was unable to perform with the Nationals, going 0\u20131 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11 bullpen appearances, with opposing hitters batting .308 against him. The Nationals designated Lidge for assignment on June 17 after two poor outings against the New York Yankees, and Ryan Mattheus was activated in his place. He was released from his contract shortly after, and returned home to Colorado in order to spend time with his family and consider whether or not he would pursue another contract.\n\nRetirement \nAfter being released from the Nationals, Lidge took the remainder of the summer to decide whether he wanted to continue his pitching career. On December 2, 2012, he announced his intentions to retire from baseball. At the time of his retirement, Lidge had 225 regular-season career saves, as well as 18 postseason saves. He also struck out 799 batters in  regular-season innings for a career 11.919 K/9, the second-best ratio of any pitcher with more than 500 innings. Lidge signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Phillies on August 1, 2013, enabling him to officially retire as a member of the organization.\n\nPersonal life\nLidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, daughter Avery Grace and son Rowan Thomas. He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies and takes online courses at Regis University. Lidge's cousin, Ryan Lidge, is currently a catcher in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nSee also\n\n Houston Astros award winners and league leaders\n List of Houston Astros no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball career saves leaders\n List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\n List of Major League Baseball single-inning strikeout leaders\n List of Philadelphia Phillies award winners and league leaders\n List of University of Notre Dame athletes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n1976 births\nLiving people\nBaseball players from Sacramento, California\nClearwater Threshers players\nCorpus Christi Hooks players\nHouston Astros players\nKissimmee Cobras players\nLakewood BlueClaws players\nLehigh Valley IronPigs players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nNational League All-Stars\nNew Orleans Zephyrs players\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish baseball players\nPotomac Nationals players\nPhiladelphia Phillies players\nQuad Cities River Bandits players\nReading Phillies players\nRound Rock Express players\nWashington Nationals players\nWorld Baseball Classic players of the United States\n2006 World Baseball Classic players", "machine_text": " Brad Lidge (born December 6, 1976) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shruti (music)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shruti or \u015bruti is a Sanskrit word, found in the Vedic texts of Hinduism where it means lyrics and \"what is heard\" in general. It is also an important concept in Indian music, where it means the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect and a singer or musical instrument can produce and do nyaas(stay) on it. The musical shruti concept is found in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra, the Dattilam, the Brihaddeshi, and the Sangita Ratnakara. Chandogya Upanishad speaks of the division of the octave in 22 parts.\n\nThe swara differs from the shruti concept in Indian music. A shruti is the smallest gradation of pitch available, while a swara is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and ragas. The Natya Shastra identifies and discusses twenty two shruti and seven swara per octave. Of the twenty two shruti, veena scholars identified the 4th shruti to be sa solfege, 7th to be re, 9th as ga, 13th as ma, 17th as pa, 20th to be dha and 22nd as ni shuddha swara. With the course of time(the present system), the Sa swar is relocated to the 1st shruti and whole svar saptak is constructed accordingly. \n\nIt has been used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music. Recent research has more precisely defined the term shruti, its difference from nada and swara, and pinpointed positions on a string to play 22 shrutis.\n\nThe most well-known example of shrutis is probably the use of the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in raga Darbari. Others include the rishabh in Bhairav, the nishad in Bhimpalasi and Miya Malhar, and the gandhar in Todi.\n\nMeaning\n\nThe meaning of shruti varies in different systems.\n\nGrama system\n\nBharata Muni uses shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible. He formulates jatis, which are classes of melodic structures. These can be further grouped into two gramas\u2014shadja-grama and madhyama-grama. The notes (swaras) are separated by intervals, as measured in shrutis.\n\nThe shadja-grama is given by the following division: Sa of four shrutis, Ri of three shrutis, Ga of two shrutis, Ma of four shrutis, Pa of four shrutis, Da of three shrutis and Ni of two shrutis. Abhinavagupta describes an experiment to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti in shadja grama, Sarana Chatushtai.\n\nThe madhyama-grama is the same, but the panchama (Pa) has to be diminished by one shruti. That is, the panchama of madhyama-grama is lower than that of shadja-grama by one shruti, according to Bharata. Shruti is only mentioned as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharata's time.\n\nIn both the gramas, Ri is three shrutis away from Sa \u2013 there are three perceptible intervals between Sa and Ri. The third of these is called trishruti rishabha (Ri). Likewise, the second interval is called dvishruti rishabha, and the first ekashruti rishabha.\n\nNotes 9 and 13 shrutis from each other occur at a ratio of 100:133.33(3:4) and 100:150(2:3) respectively and are mutually samv\u0101di (consonant). The notes that are at the distance of two and 20 shrutis are mutually viv\u0101di (dissonant). The remaining ones are called anuv\u0101di (assonant).\n\nThe shruti table below shows the mathematical ratios considered to correspond to the system described by Bharata and Dattilam, along with the comparable notes in common Western 12-TET tuning. The names of the 22 shrutis were provided by \u015a\u0101r\u00f1gadeva.\n\nMela system\n\nBy the time Venkatamakhin formulated the melakarta (\"mela\") system, the grama system was no longer in use. Unlike the grama system, the mela system uses the same starting swara. It forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras, and does not specify a fixed interval for a swara in terms of shrutis. For example, the intervals of kakali-nishad and shuddha-madhyam vary depending on the dhaivat and the gandhar that precede them, respectively. The interval of kakali-nishad is of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha, pancha-shruti or shat-shruti-dhaivat preceded it. Thus shruti as a measure of interval is not fully employed in the mela system.\n\nControversy\n\nIn current practice of Carnatic music, shruti has several meanings. It is used by musicians in several contexts. For instance, the Tamil term \"Oru kattai sruti (\u0b92\u0bb0\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc8 \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf)\" means that the tonic is set to the pitch C or the first key. The Telugu term \"Shruti chesuko (\u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c41\u0c24\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c38\u0c41\u0c15\u0c4b)\" is a way to correspond with the accompanying artists to tune their instruments.\n\nIn certain ragas, due to inflexions or gamakas on some of those 12 notes, listeners perceive a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note. Some scholars have attempted to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharata's 22 shrutis, which lead to confusion and controversy. It was also wrongly attributed to Bharata, who proposed shruti in a completely different context.\n\nSome scientific evidence shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga do not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis. The number 22 is of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions, partly because different musicians use slightly different \"shrutis\" when performing the same raga, an example being the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in Darbari. The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology, which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or more than 22. N. Ramanathan, a musicologist points this out and says that the idea of 22 shrutis is applicable only to the music system of Bharata's time.\n\nAn Indian monograph about shruti claims various opinions about the number (66, 53) of shrutis. In recent times it seems that the number of shrutis is broadly agreed upon to be 22. Recognizing the controversy over the number and the exact ratios of shruti intervals, it also says that not all shruti intervals are equal and known as pramana shruti (22%), nyuna shruti (70% cents) and purana shruti (90%). \u0415ach shruti may be approximated in 53EDO system.\n\nRelationship to , , and \n\nShruti is intimately linked to the fundamental aspects of .\n\n (Sanskrit) means sound of any kind. Out of all the  created in the world, sounds that are 'musical'\u2014give an experience or perception of a 'musical' sound\u2014are called Nadas. The sound of a 'clap' is a , but that of a bell is a nada. The commonest example of nada is a musical sound made on a stretched string under constant tension. There are innumerable 'nadas' in a Saptak (octave). Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 3, Chapter 2, stated that,\n\nmeaning,\n\n'Shrutis are the 'special' Nadas that cause . There is no difference between  and shrutis as both are nadas.\n\nOut of the innumerable  on a string, 22 become 'special' and are called shrutis because the perception of the 12 universal pitch classes of Chromatic scale (Swara-prakara) 'changes' with them. Further, Shrutis 'selected' in a Raga 'cause' (or become) the swaras. Thus, shrutis are called  in a raga, and both are primarily Nadas.\n\nIn this way, sounds () are progressively classified as:\n All sounds in the world are .\n Selected  become , (innumerable), which provide a musical experience.\n Selected Nadas become shrutis, (22), which create a change in the perception of 12 swaraprakaras (universal chromatic pitch classes) as we play them from one end of the string. This change happens only at 22 points as placed by nature.\n Selected (12 or fewer) shrutis become  \u2014 used in a particular raga.\nMatanga's conclusion is highly significant that 'Swaras' are manifested through the 'Shrutis'.  Note that swara in a raga (1 single frequency), is different from swaraprakara (12 universal pitch classes of a chromatic scale with a range of different frequencies). Gamakas or alankaras  or \u2018specific tonal configurations forming the core of a Raga\u2019  are merely a combination of shrutis and Nadas. (See section 2.9).\n\nIdentification of a shruti, distinct from nada \n\nIn performance, notes identified as one of the 12 universal pitch classes of Chromatic scale (swara-prakara) are the shrutis, and connected unidentified notes between them are nadas. The human ear takes about '20\u201345 msec' to identify a note within the range of the human voice\u2014from 100 to 1000\u00a0Hz. Thus, the ear can identify shrutis played or sung longer than that\u2014but cannot identify nadas played or sung faster than that limit, but can only hear them. Lack of appreciation of this difference has led to many scientists to opine that because of the meend and the oscillating notes, it is hard to determine the exact numerical frequencies. In a glide or meend. E.g., there are two 'Shrutis' at the two ends, which are connected by nadas in-between. This in fact, is the basic structure of any phrase created in Indian Music (Hindustani and Carnatic), as two or more shrutis connected by nadas. Indian Classical Music (both Hindustani and Carnatic) employs a combination of identifiable 'shrutis' and connecting, fleeting, unidentifiable nadas in any Alankara or Gamaka (Music).\n\nNatural existence of 22 shrutis on a string\n\nIn ancient times, shruti was described in Sanskrit as Shruyate iti Shruti, meaning, \"What is heard is a shruti\". This loose translation created confusion because, Shru (in Sanskrit) does not merely mean \"to hear\", but to \"hear, understand and learn\". The \"understanding\" and \"learning\" part is the natural fact that on 22 specific points on a string, the perception of notes changes.\n\nBrihaddeshi (Sanskrit) by Pandit Matanga  mentions after Shloka 24, in Shrutiprakarana (Chapter on Shrutis) that,\n\nShravanendriya Gr\u0100hyatv\u0100d Dhwanireva Shrutirbhavet\n\nmeaning, \"Only when the ear understands (the point on the string where perception of the notes changes), does that sound become a Shruti.\"       \nHe further says that these points on the string are very precise, as in Shloka 28, Chapter 1, in Nadaprakarana (Chapter on Nadas) that, \u0100d\u0100tmyam Cha Vivartatvam K\u0100ryatvam Parin\u0100mita Abhivyanjakat\u0100 Cha api Shrutin\u0100m Parikathyate  {\u0924\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u091e\u094d\u091c\u0915\u0924\u093e \u091a\u093e\u092a\u093f  \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0940\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0925\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\n} meaning, \"Reaching (the point on the string where the perception of the notes changes), and reverting (from there) results in the precision that is called as 'Shruti.\"\n\nThere are 12 universally identifiable musical notes  (pitch classes of Chromatic scale or Swara-prakara) in a Saptak (Octave).They indicate 'a musical note or scale degree, but Shruti is a more subtle division of the octave'. The recent research has shown that 10 out of 12 of these notes (Swaraprakaras) have a 'spread' or a 'region' on a string (Swara-kshetra in Sanskrit) in which, 'any' frequency leads to the perception of the 'same' note by the human ear, and the perception 'changes' at both the ends. The remaining 2 notes, namely the Fundamental frequency (Shadja) and the perfect 5th (Panchama) have a 'single point' on which they are placed on the string by nature. Thus, the 10 notes give 20 Shrutis, and along with the 2 points of Fundamental frequency (Shadja) and the Perfect 5th (Panchama), a natural system of 22 Shrutis can be observed and played on any string.\n\nThese 22 Shrutis are not theoretical postulates, but solid musical facts that provide the foundation of Indian music, and have been used for centuries.\n\nSeveral ancient scholars have cited 22 Shrutis including Dattila (AD 400\u2013100 BC, in Shlokas 12\u201314), Sarangadeva (AD 1210\u20131247, after Shloka 11 in Sangeeta Ratnakara), Ramamatya (AD 1550 in Shlokas 24\u201326 in Swaramelakalanidhi), Somanatha (AD 1609 in Shloka 17, Chapter 1, in Ragavibodha) and Venkatamakhin (AD 1626\u20131662, in Shloka 5, Chapter 2; Shlokas 2\u20133, Chapter 3; and Shlokas 94, 105, 106, Chapter 4 in Chaturdandi Prakashika).\n\nThe 22 Shrutis can also be called as 'microtones', because they are produced at mathematically defined micro-positions.\n\nThe Evolution of 22 Shrutis from Shadja (Fundamental) and their natural arrangement on a string\n\nAll the 22 Shrutis evolve from Shadja (Fundamental).\n\nFigure showing the Evolution of 22 Shrutis from Shadja (Fundamental) and their natural arrangement on a string\n\nThe sequentially placed 12 universal pitch classes in an Octave on the string, are represented in the above diagram by the Indian synonyms r, R, g, G, M, m, P, d, D, n, N, S'. Most Western music divides the octave into 12 notes, whereas Indian classical music divides them into 22 notes. Except for P (Perfect 5th) and S'(Fundamental frequency) which are played at a single point each (13 and 22 respectively), all other 10 notes have a 'spread' or a 'region' on the string (Swara-kshetra). The 'beginning' and 'end' of these regions form a total of 22 points. e.g., For the region of r, the perception of r begins at point 1 (called swara-uday-bindu in Sanskrit meaning, the point where the swara emerges or starts) and ends at point '2' (called 'Swara-Asta-Bindu' in Sanskrit meaning, the point where the swara disappears or ends). For the region of 'R', the perception of R begins at point '3' and ends at point '4', and so on.\n\nIt is highly significant that Matanga arrives at the conclusion that Swara is manifested through the Shrutis and that Swaras are separated by each other by bands of Shrutis.\n\nRatios and frequencies\n\nIt was shown in this research that 22 Shrutis are essentially related to Shadja (Fundamental frequency), by most natural interval ratios, 100:125 (S:G) or 100:150 (S:P) as shown in the Figure below. This helps us to get their precise positions and frequencies.\n\nFigure showing 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram)\n\n1 denotes a 'lower' shruti or the 'beginning' of the region of the note on a string.\n2 denotes a 'higher' shruti or the 'end' of the region of the note on a string,\nSmall letters denote a komal or flatter version (except m, which is 'tara'),\nCapital letters denote a tara or sharper version (except M, which is 'komal'),\nVertical arrows indicate an interval ratio of 100:125.\nHorizontal arrows indicate an Interval ratio of 100:150.\n\nFig. showing 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram) (Carnatic).\n\n12 Swaras with their 16 names are shown as S, R1, R2/G1, R3, G1, G2/R3, G3, M1, M2, P, D1, D2/N1, D3, N1, N2/D3, N3. Their \u2018Lower\u2019 and \u2018Higher\u2019 Shruti versions are shown respectively marked as \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018H\u2019 in Italics. Vertical arrow indicates an Interval ratio of 100:125. Horizontal arrow indicates an Interval ratio of 100:150.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of Shrutis, for every horizontal arrow, 50% is added; and for every vertical arrow, 25% is added. e.g., to calculate the 'frequency' of P, consider the frequency of Shadja as 100\u00a0Hz (for convenience of calculation). Thus, P comes at 100\u00a0Hz + 50% = 150\u00a0Hz. The ratio of P thus becomes 150/100. To calculate the 'position' of  P on the string, we can use the law of Galileo Galilei, called in India as \u2018Dviguna\u2019 relationship, which states that the frequency ratio is 'inversely' proportional to the length of the string. Therefore, when the ratio 150/100 is 'inverted' we get the position of P on the string as 100/150 or 2/3 or 66.66% length of the string. We can calculate the frequencies and the positions of all the 22 shrutis accordingly.\n\nTable showing the Ratios, Frequencies, % length of the string where 22 Shrutis are played (*Frequency of the Fundamental frequency or Shadja taken as 100\u00a0Hz, as example)\n\nThus, Shrutis can be expressed as 1) 'Interval ratio',  2) Audio frequency, and 3) The playing position as % length of the string.\n\nThere is not a single common note between the European 12-Tone Equal Temperament Scale and the 22-Shruti-Indian scale.\n\nTable shows % frequency above Shadja (Fundamental Tone) of the \n12-Tone-Equal Temperament Scale and the 22-Shruti-Indian Scale.\n\nNew musical instruments have been made to demonstrate the accurate sounds, the position, and the practical use of 22 shrutis in music, including a 22-Shruti-Harmonium (Indian Patent No. 250197), 22-Shruti-Veena, 22-Shruti-Metallophone and 22 Shruti-Tanpura. In both the Hindusthani and Carnatic classical music, the places for playing 22 shrutis (as % length of the string) remain exactly the same on instruments such as Veena, Sarod, Sitar, Sarangi, Violin as shown in the table and diagram.\n\n4 Shrutis each of the notes R, G, M, D and N progress in a symmetrical order  of Poorna, Pramana, Nyuna, Pramana as shown in the diagram.\n\n22 Shrutis are a sub-set of Natural 7 Shrutis \n\nThe Indian Classical Music (both Hindustani and Carnatic) is based on the Tanpura, which produces the 1st 3 natural shrutis, Shadja (1st Harmonic), Gandhar (5th Harmonic), and Pancham (3rd Harmonic), at a ratio of 100:125:150. The basic 7 Shrutis are called \u2018Shuddha\u2019 (in Sanskrit meaning pure) in Hindustani Classical Music. They are produced at the same natural ratio as shown in the diagram with a   2-Step process.\n\nThus, the frequencies of the 1st Natural 7 Shrutis emerge as S=100 (taken for convenience), R=112.5, G=125, M =133.33, P=150, D=166.66, and N=187.5. The 22 Shrutis can be seen as a sub-set of 7 natural Shrutis as shown in the diagram.\n\nMusically, out of the 7 natural Shrutis, (see diagram)\n If R is taken as S, G becomes R1, coming at 111.1111111, a ratio of 10/9.\n If R is taken as S, M becomes g1, coming at 118.518518, a ratio of 32/27.\n If R is taken as S, S\u2019 becomes n1, coming at 177.777777, a ratio of 16/9.\n If G is taken as S, M becomes r2, coming at 106.666666, a ratio of 16/15.\n If G is taken as S, P becomes g2, coming at 120, a ratio of 6/5.\n If G is taken as S, S\u2019 becomes d2, coming at 160, a ratio of 8/5.\n If G is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes n2, coming at 180, a ratio of 9/5.\n If M is taken as S, N becomes m1, coming at 140.625, a ratio of 45/32.  \n If M is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes D2, coming at 168.75, a ratio of 27/16.\n If D is taken as S, R\u2019 becomes at M2, coming at 135, a ratio of 27/20.\n\nThese 10 Shrutis and the 7 natural Shrutis together make 17 out of 22 Shrutis, directly emerging from 7 natural Shrutis. The remaining 5 Shrutis is just a matter of filling the blanks considering the symmetrical order of R,G,M, D, and N.\n\nPoorna, Pramana and Nyuna Shrutis \n\nWhen the frequency and positions of all 22 shrutis are calculated, we get 3 ratios operating between 22 Shrutis as 256/243 (Pythagorean limma or Pythagorean diatonic semitone or Pythagorean minor semitone), 25/24 (a type of Just diatonic semitone) and 81/80 (Syntonic comma). Out of these, 81/80 operates in the 'region' of 10 notes and was called as 'Pramana', in Sanskrit meaning 'Standard' (region of the note). Out of the remaining 2 ratios, the bigger (256/243) was called as Poorna (in Sanskrit meaning 'big'), and the smaller (25/24) was called as 'Nyuna' (in Sanskrit meaning 'small'). Poorna comes between Shrutis 0\u20131, 4\u20135, 8\u20139, 12\u201313, 13\u201314, 17\u201318, and 21\u201322, Nyuna between Shrutis 2\u20133, 6\u20137, 10\u201311, 15\u201316, 19\u201320, and Pramana between Shrutis 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136, 7\u20138, 9\u201310, 11\u201312, 14\u201315, 16\u201317, 18\u201319, 20\u201321. Now, it possible to play a precise note on a string every time without difficulty, because,  irrespective of the length of the string or the frequency in which the string is tuned,    7 Poorna, 5 Nyuna, and 10 Pramana Shrutis yield sequentially, perfect playing positions of 22 Shrutis on any string instrument. To eliminate confusion, the words Poorna, Pramana and Nyuna should be called as \u2018Shrutyantara\u2019 (in Sanskrit) meaning distance between Shrutis rather than \u2018Shruti\u2019, which indicates a musical note. Poorna, Pramana and Nyuna Shrutis correspond respectively to Pythagorean Limma (90 cents), Diatonic Semitone Minor (70 cents), and Comma of Didymus (22 cents).\n\nShrutis in Shadja Grama\n\nThe basic Indian Scale was called as Shadja Grama in Bharata's Natya Shastra. It had 7 notes emanating at Shruti nos. 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22 (See figure below). The precise places to play these 7 notes on a string is already shown in the above table. Bharata divided the scale of 7 notes by 'no.' of shrutis (distance measured by no. of shrutis).\n\nFigure showing Shadja Grama on a stretched string.\n\nThe 1st line shows Shruti nos. The 7 notes are in bold. \nThe 2nd line shows the synonyms and the 7 notes as bold and underlined. \nThe 3rd line shows the Shrutis 'in-between the 7 notes' as bold and underlined,\n\nBharata's Natya Shastra states in Chapter 28, Shloka 24 that S' is situated on the 4th shruti (after n1), M1 is situated on the 4th Shruti (after g1), P is situated on the 4th Shruti (after M1), R1 is situated on the 3rd Shruti (after S', the cycle repeats from the beginning), D1 is situated on the 3rd Shruti (after P), g1 is situated on the 2nd Shruti (after R1), and n1 is situated on the 2nd Shruti (after D1). Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 105 and 106, Chapter 4, narrates the same sequence of Shrutis as,\n\n Chatush Chatush Chatush Cha Eva Shadja Madhyama Panchamou Dve Dve Nish\u0100da G\u0100ndharou Tri Tri Rishabha Dhaivatou \n\nmeaning,\n\nShadja, Madhyama and Panchama (situated on) 4, 4, and 4; Nishad and Gandhara (situated on) 2 and 2; Rishabha and Dhaivata (situated on) 3 and 3.\n\nThus, the 7-Note scale as indicated by this arrangement is R1, g1, M1, P, D1, n1 and S', and is called as 'Shadja Grama' in Natya Shastra. This scale is close to the current version of the Kafi (raga). Thus, the notes of Shadja Grama are situated on Shruti nos. 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22; and these notes are separated by 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, and 4 shrutis respectively.\n\nShadja Grama (the 7 notes documented by Bharata in Natyashastra) is very much in use today, providing the perfect Swaras for Ragas such as Abhogi, Bageshri, Bhimpalasi, and Gorakh Kalyan in Hindustani Classical Music; and Abheri, Reethigowla, and Suddha Dhanyasi in Carnatic Music. All the other Ragas too are derived from selection of different Shrutis as shown in the diagram.\n\nShrutis in Madhyama Grama\n\nThe ancient Indian musicologists knew that the voice range of females is placed by nature at a 'higher' pitch than males. They, therefore created the scale for females, beginning on the 9th Shruti (M1) with a higher frequency. Hence, this scale was called as Madhyama Grama in Bharata's Natya Shastra. It had 7 notes emanating at the same shruti nos. as in Shadja Grama, i.e., 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22. The precise places to play these 7 notes on a string is already shown in the earlier table. The precise place to play the new shruti, P1 is shown below.\n\nFigure showing Madhyama Grama on a stretched string.\n\nThe 1st line shows Shruti nos. The 7 notes are in bold. \nThe 2nd line shows the synonyms and the 7 notes as bold and underlined. \nThe 3rd line shows the Shrutis 'in-between the 7 notes' as bold and underlined\n\nBharata's Natya Shastra states in Chapter 28, Shloka 27 and 28, the shrutis in Madhyama Grama. As M1 functions as the 'new' Fundamental frequency (Shadja), M2 must become redundant as it is too close to it. Also, in this new scale, P from Shadja Grama operates as P2 or (musically, Ati-Tara Rishabha, see Nomenclature table below), and Tara Rishabha  or a shruti at an Interval ratio 10/9 (Just Major Second) is absent. To create this missing Tara Rishabha, P2 must be lowered by Interval ratio of 81/80 (Pramana) creating a new shruti P1. Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 65 and 66, Chapter 3, confirms the positions of Panchama both in Shadja and Madhyama Gramas as,\n Shadja Gr\u0100ma Panchame Swa Chaturtha Shruti Sansthite Swa-Up\u0100ntya Shruti Sansthe Asmin Madhyama Gr\u0100ma Ishyate \nmeaning,\n\nin Shadja Grama, Panchama is positioned on its 4th Shruti, and on its previous Shruti in Madhyama Grama.\n\nThis previous Shruti P1 has a frequency of 148.148 (if Shadja is taken as 100\u00a0Hz), and can be played on 67.56% length on the string.  The scale starting from M1 is close to the current version of Khamaj (raga). Now, the notes at 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 22 becomes the Madhyama Grama, these notes are separated by 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, and 4 shrutis respectively. Musically, P in Shadja Grama (3/2) operates as the Perfect 5th, and the same shruti (P2 in Madhyama Grama) operates as 9/8 (another ratio for Just Major Second) in Madhyama Grama, because the Fundamental frequency has changed to M1.\n\nA combination of \u2018Shrutis\u2019 and \u2018Nadas\u2019 is the back-bone of Gamakas, and Alankaras\n\nBoth the types of Indian Classical Music namely the Hindustani, and the Carnatic, essentially employ a variety of musical phrases known as Gamaka (Music) (Carnatic) and Alankara (Hindustani). These phrases employ primarily a combination of 'Shrutis' (identified steady notes) and connecting Nadas' (unidentified fleeting notes) only. Chaturdandi Prakashika (Sanskrit) by Pandit Venkatamakhin in Shloka 118, Chapter 3, gives the description of Gamaka as,\n Swarasya Kampo Gamakah, Shrotru Chitta Sukh\u0100vah, Sweeya Sth\u0100na Shruti Gatah Chhay\u0100m any\u0100m \u0100shray\u0100m api \nmeaning,\n                                                                                         \nSwara's movement creates Gamaka, delighting the listeners, going from the position of its own Shruti to reside in the shadow of another.\nGamaka or 'Alankara' thus means a Swara goes from its own (identifiable) Shruti to the other, making use of (unidentified connecting) 'Nadas' in-between.\n\nIn any Gamaka (Music), Alankara, or 'Inflexion', 'Ornamentation' etc., one can not have a 3rd type of note, other than a 'Shruti' and a 'Nada'. The threshold of identification of a musical note within the range of human voice of 100\u20131000 Hertz is 20\u201345 msec. Shrutis can be identified by the human ear because they are played for this time limit or more. As against this, connecting Nadas are played faster than this limit, which disallows the human ear to identify them. The major difference in the two systems is the way they combine shrutis and connect nadas, resulting in characteristically different music between the styles. Many ancient Sanskrit and Tamil works refer to 22 shrutis as the foundation of the Indian Music Scale.\n\nWhy does the Melakarta system (Carnatic) not have prescribed shrutis\n\nThe system of 72 basic types of singing or playing scales (Tha\u013cas) was evolved with specific mathematical combinations of the universal 12 pitch classes. The selection of the 22 Shrutis (specific frequencies) in each of them depends on the 'R\u0101ga' chosen. The Shrutis in a Raga should be ideally related to each other, by natural ratios 100:125, 100:133.33, 100:150, and 100:166.66. 'Raga' can have a 'lesser' no. of notes than those in a 'Tha\u013ca'. Therefore, Shrutis can be selected only 'after' the selection of a Raga. Melakarta 72 Thatas therefore do not have 'prescribed' Shrutis with them. Only 'Raga' can have shrutis, not 'Tha\u013ca'. Alaku is a name for Shruti in ancient Tamil music and 22 Shrutis are referred to as 22 Alakus. All the 22 Shrutis attain the status of Swaras, in some raga or the other.\n\nNomenclature of 22 Shrutis/Swaras in Carnatic Music and Hindustani Classical Music\n\nThe Nomenclature in Carnatic and Hindustani systems has been imperfect largely due to the ignorance about the scientific facts about 12 Swaraprakaras (Chromatic pitch-classes) and the inter-spaced 22 Shrutis. In Carnatic nomenclature, for example, the 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham (called as Suddha Rishabham) is followed by 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham, omitting the 'Dvi' and 'Tri'-sruthi versions of Rishabham. The same is true of Daivatham too. In reality, the 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham (as a Swaraprakara) has 'Eka'-sruthi Rishabham and 'Dvi'-sruthi Rishabham (as it is two ). Further, the 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham (as a Swaraprakara) has 'Tri'-sruthi Rishabham and 'Chatu'-sruthi Rishabham (as it is two ). The same is true of Daivatham. Also, there is the creation of an additional name each for Chatu-sruthi Rishabham, Sadharana Gandharam, Chatu-sruthi Daivatham and Kaishiki Nishadam; respectively as Suddha Gandharam, Shat-sruthi Rishabham, Suddha Nishadam and Shat-sruthi Daivatham. These apparent omissions and additions confound the Carnatic nomenclature. The all-inclusive Nomenclature for 12 Swaraprakaras and 22 Sruthis is shown in the Table.\n\nTable shows Nomenclature for 12 Swara-prakaras and 22 Shrutis in Carnatic Classical Music.\n\nSimilarly in Hindustani Music, the names of 'Komal' and 'Shuddha' Swaras have no uniformity. The Rishabha, Gandhar, Dhaivat and Nishad have the 'Komal' version first followed by 'Shuddha'; whereas for Madhyam, there is the 'Shuddha' version first followed by 'Teevra'. These names have also been carried forward due to ignorance about the meanings of these names, and also about 22 Shrutis. 'Komal' is the 'flatter' variety of the note and the correct name for the 'sharper' version is 'Tara', not 'Shuddha'. 'Teevra' (in Sanskrit) means 'of a larger volume', not 'of a higher frequency'! Hence, 'any' note such as Rishabha, Gandhar, Madhyama, Dhaivata and Nishad can be Teevra, or of a larger volume. The correct 12 names of Hindustani 12 notes are 1) Shadja, 2) Komal Rishabha, 3) Tara Rishabha, 4) Komal Gandhara, 5) Tara Gandhara, 6) Komal Madhyama, 7) Tara Madhyama, 8) Panchama, 9) Komal Dhaivata, 10) Tara Dhaivata, 11) Komal Nishada, and 12) Tara Nishad. 'Komal' notes are subdivided into their Shrutis 'Ati-Komal' (Lower frequency version) and 'Komal' (Higher frequency version); and 'Tara' notes into 'Tara' (Lower frequency version) and 'Ati-Tara' (Higher frequency version). Out of the 22 notes thus created, the word shuddha denotes 'purity' and signifies notes with a natural ratio of 100:125:150. Seven of the 22 notes (see table) are thus additionally called shuddha. The complete nomenclature for 12 swaraprakaras and 22 shrutis in Hindustani Classical Music is shown in the table.\n\nTable shows nomenclature for 12 swara-prakaras and 22 shrutis in Hindustani classical music.\n\n(* Seven shuddha notes in the table are underlined and bold.)\n\nThe 12 swaraprakaras and 22 shrutis in both the Hindustani and Carnatic tables are exactly the same in terms of ratios, frequencies, and percentage of length of the string where they are played.\n\nSanskrit Names of 22 Shrutis\n\nSangita Ratnakara of Sarangadeva states in Chapter 3, shlokas 35 to 38 that Teevra, Kumudvati, Manda and Chandovati are the names of shrutis for Shadja. As Shadja is placed on the 4th shruti in this group, this means that Chandovati is the name for the shruti of Shadja. The reference further mentions in further sequence; Dayavati/ Ranjani/Raktika as shrutis for Rishabha, Roudri/Krodha for Gandhara, Vajrika/ Prasarini/Priti/Marjani for Madhyama, Kshiti/Rakta/Sandipani/Alapini for Panchama, Madanti/Rohini/Ramya for Dhaivata, and Ugra/Kshobhini for Nishada.\n\nWhy performance analysis never gives true values for 22 Shrutis \n\nSome suggest that the best way to find the exact positions of shrutis is by analyzing the frequencies players use in actual performances. This sounds simple, but runs the risk of giving multiple inaccurate values. In fact, when different artists performed raga Yaman on flute, sarangi, sitar, and voice, accuracy of pitch was found to be 'relative' and 'subjective', and 'neither rigidly fixed','nor randomly varying'. Further, the 'same Swara was pitched differently at different times by the same artiste in the same raga', and 'different artistes intoned the same swara differently in the same raga'. Such an exercise is akin to estimating the centre of a large circular lake by comparing intersections between ropes stretched across the surface; this gives a range of answers, and introduces difficulties in estimating accuracy. It is more practical to define the centre of a circle mathematically, and then compute the centre of the lake relative to points fixed in advance. Similarly, the values of 22 shrutis can be precisely calculated based on their natural relationships to the 22 Shruti-Mandal (Organogram) rather than an analysis of performances.\n\nAncient treatises on Indian classical music and performing arts\n Natya Shastra by Bharata\n Dattilam by Dattila\n Brihaddeshi by Matanga Muni\n Abhinavabharati \u2013 Abhinava Gupta's commentary on Natya Shastra\n Sangita Ratnakara by Sarangadeva\n Svaramelakalanidhi by Ramamatya\n Charurdandi Prakashika by Venkatamakhin\n Ragavibodha by Somanatha\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n www.22shruti.com\n\nIndian classical music\nIntervals (music)\nHindustani music terminology\nCarnatic music terminology", "machine_text": " Shruti (music) In Indian classical music, shruti (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u093f, literally \"that which is heard\"), is the smallest interval of pitch that can be identified by the human ear. The concept is closely related to the notion of pitch. A shruti is notated by the first three letters of the Indian alphabet, \"\u0901 \u0936 \u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e\" (na shra ta). The equivalent term in western music is \"quarter tone\", a half step or half-tone apart. However, shrutis are not precisely equivalent to quarter tones because they are melismatic. A shruti is defined as the pitch of a single note in the raga, and is the basic unit of measurement for distances between notes in the melody. However, the actual distance between two shrutis may be more or less than the distance between two Western quarter tones. For example, the pitch of the highest note of a piano (C5) to the pitch of the lowest note of a piano (C2) is an interval of 12 shrutis (the span of an octave), while the distance from the highest to the lowest note on a piano is 15 quarter tones. The 22 shrutis form a basic vocabulary of pitches from which the melodies of ragas are constructed. Indian classical music divides the shrutis into two groups: shadav-shrutis (literally, \"sixteen shrutis\"), and tivra-shrutis (literally, \"six shrutis\"). The shadav-shrutis form a system of 16 pitch classes, and the tivra-shrutis form a system of 6 pitch classes. The tivra-shrutis are sometimes called \"chromatic\" shrutis because they are what allow the musician to produce chromaticism, which is more common in Indian classical music than in Western classical music. In practice, the precise pitches of the shrutis are determined by the tune of the raga, and are not fixed. Furthermore, the distance between shrutis is not even. If an Indian classical musician is asked to produce the note \"C\", the musician will produce the note which is closest to \"C\" in the musician's own system of shrutis. Microtones are also found in other traditions of music in India, such as Indian folk music, as well as in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and other countries with a strong influence from Indian classical music. However, the use of microtones in these traditions is generally not as developed as in Indian classical music.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 597778}

The building was designed by James Knox Taylor, the Supervising Architect of the United States Department of the Treasury, in the Classical Revival architectural style. The building is faced with bricks and granite. The front (southern) elevation is five bays wide. The three center bays are defined by four, two-story, granite Ionic columns in the Composite style, a style combining the Ionic and Corinthian orders. The two end bays have similar, two-story, brick structures with stone trim. The second story of the end bays has three windows, while the center bays have six windows. The windows are all similar, two-over-two, double-hung windows with bronze frames and a spandrel between the second and third floors. The building's entrance is in the center of the front elevation, recessed behind a pair of bronze doors. Over the doors is a decorative bronze trim, with a bronze eagle, flag, and mailboxes. The building has a full-length, eight-bay, rear (northern) elevation. The center six bays have loading doors, with a pair of doors at the first and third floors and a single door at the fifth floor. The end bays have granite stairwells to the basement. The east end of the rear elevation has a brick addition, which contains the building's heating and cooling plant. The west end of the rear elevation has a five-bay loading dock, with a pair of doors at the first and third floors and a single door at the fifth floor.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28132099}

Late in life, Lockhart wrote a short, candid memoir. He joined the US Army and was posted to Germany, working in \"a low-level intelligence agency,\" translating letters from East Germany. Returning to the US, he entered the graduate program at University of Wisconsin, where he pursued his doctorate in the social history of conquest-era Peru.\n\nHis dissertation, published in 1968 as Spanish Peru, 1531-1560 was a path breaking approach to this early period. Less interested in the complicated political events of the era, he focused on the formation of Spanish colonial society in the midst of Spanish war with the indigenous and internecine struggles between factions of conquerors.  With separate chapters on different social groups, including Africans and indigenous brought into the Spanish sphere, and an important chapter on women of the conquest era, his work shifted the understanding of that era.  His main source for the people and processes of this early period were notarial documents, often property transfers and other types of legal agreements, which gave insight into the formation and function of Spanish colonial society.  The work is now a classic and was published in a second, revised edition in 1994.\n\nWhile researching Spanish Peru, he compiled information on the Spaniards who received a share of the ransom of the Inca Atahualpa, extracted at Cajamarca. The Men of Cajamarca has both individual biographies of those who shared in the treasure, as well as a thorough analysis of the general social patterns of those conquerors.  Both Spanish Peru and The Men of Cajamarca have been published in Spanish translation.\n\nHe began to do research on colonial Mexico while at University of Texas, looking both at the socioeconomic patterns there and began learning Nahuatl.  Fruits of these new interests were the publication of the anthology Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution (edited with Ida Altman) and Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period (with linguist Frances Karttunen).\n\nHe moved to University of California, Los Angeles, where he spent the bulk of his teaching career 1972\u20131994, retiring early and continuing to collaborate with colleagues on research projects and mentor graduate students working on historical sources in the Nahuatl language and the colonial-era Nahua people.\n\nAmong his many graduate students in colonial Spanish American social history and the philology of Mesoamerican indigenous languages, who earned doctorates under his mentorship are S.L.(Sarah) Cline, Kimberly Gauderman,  Robert Haskett, Rebecca Horn, John E. Kicza, Leslie K. Lewis, Doris Namala, Leslie Offutt, Matthew Restall, Susan Schroeder, Lisa Sousa, Kevin Terraciano, John Tutino, John Super, and Stephanie Wood.\n\nHe was a major contributor to a field of ethnohistory built on the study of indigenous-language sources from colonial Mexico, which he called New Philology. He collaborated with colonial Brazilianist Stuart B. Schwartz in writing Early Spanish America (1983), which is a foundational text for graduate students studying colonial Latin America.  He was the series editor for the Nahuatl Studies Series, initially based at the UCLA Latin American Center and then jointly with Stanford University Press.

Lockhart was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Maryland. He is the son of William Lockhart, a career U.S. Army officer, and his wife, the former Jean multimillionaire socialite Martha Field. His parents married in 1928, three months before the Wall Street crash. They divorced in 1945. After graduating from St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. in 1947, Lockhart attended Harvard University, where he graduated in 1951 with an A.B. in Spanish. He then joined the U.S. Foreign Service, serving in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Mexico, where he studied Mexican history. In 1960, he married his first wife, Alice, a Mexican from a prominent family. The following year, he transferred to the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, where he worked as a researcher on Latin America. In 1965, he joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin as an assistant professor of history. He was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and to professor of history in 1977. He retired in 2007. In 1976, Lockhart published The Spanish Republic and Civil War, 1932\u201339, the first of his several books on the history of Spain. This work explored the role of the Spanish Republic's foreign policy in the face of fascist aggression and the assistance provided to the Republicans by the International Brigades. He followed this with a short book on the history of Mexico, The Military, the Church, and the Jews: Culture, Society, and Politics in Mexico, 1531\u20131783 (1983). This was the basis for a documentary film of the same name that he produced for the A&E Network in 1984. In 1992, he published the first of two volumes on the history of Spanish Texas, Spain's Frontier Colony: The Weeki Wachee District of West Florida, 1821\u20131845. The second volume, Spain's Hidden Empire: The Quest for El Dorado, was published in 1996. In 1999, he produced a documentary film on the history of the Spanish missions in the United States for the A&E Network. In 2006, Lockhart was the recipient of the Spain-USA Foundation's \"Casa de Canavos\" award, which is given to \"an American scholar or personality who has made an outstanding contribution to the study and understanding of Spanish culture and its numerous contributions to the United States and the world.\" In 2013, Lockhart's personal and family papers were donated to the University of Texas at Austin.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Topaz War Relocation Center\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Topaz War Relocation Center, also known as the Central Utah Relocation Center (Topaz) and briefly as the Abraham Relocation Center, was an American concentration camp which housed Americans of Japanese descent and immigrants who had come to the United States from Japan, called Nikkei. President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called \"relocation centers\" like Topaz during World War II. Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945.\n\nThe camp, approximately  west of Delta, Utah, consisted of , with a  main living area. Most internees lived in the main living area, though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers. The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time. The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable, even after the belated installation of pot-bellied stoves. The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school, a library, and some recreational facilities. Camp life was documented in a newspaper, Topaz Times, and in the literary publication Trek. Internees worked inside and outside the camp, mostly in agricultural labor. Many internees became notable artists.\n\nIn the winter of 1942\u20131943, a loyalty questionnaire asked prisoners if they would declare their loyalty to the United States of America and if they would be willing to enlist. The questions were divisive, and prisoners who were considered \"disloyal\" because of their answers on the loyalty questionnaire were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Camp. One internee, James Wakasa, was shot and killed for being too close to the camp's fence. Topaz prisoners held a large funeral and stopped working until administrators relaxed security.\n\nIn 1983, Jane Beckwith founded the Topaz Museum Board. Topaz became a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2007. After many years of organizing, fundraising, and collecting information and artifacts, the Topaz Museum was built in Delta and debuted with a display of the art created at Topaz. Permanent exhibits, installed in 2017, chronicle the people who were interned there and tell their stories.\n\nTerminology\n\nSince the end of World War II, there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to Topaz and the other camps in which Americans of Japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents were imprisoned by the United States government during the war. Topaz has been referred to as a \"relocation camp,\" \"relocation center,\" \"internment camp,\" and \"concentration camp,\" and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continued throughout the late 1990s. In a preface to a 1997 book on Topaz written and published by the Topaz Museum, the Topaz Museum Board informs readers that it is accurate to refer to the camps as a \"detention camp\" or \"concentration camp\" and its residents as \"prisoners\" or \"internees\".\n\nHistory\n\nIn December 1941, the Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Shortly afterwards in February 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. The order forced approximately 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent (Nisei) and Japanese-born residents (Issei)  in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska on the West Coast of the United States to leave their homes. About 5,000 left the off-limits area during the \"voluntary evacuation\" period, and avoided internment. The remaining 110,000 were soon removed from their homes by Army and National Guard troops.\n\nTopaz was opened September 11, 1942, and eventually became the fifth-largest city in Utah, with over 9,000 internees and staff, and covering approximately  (mostly used for agriculture). A total of 11,212 people lived at Topaz at one time or another. Utah governor Herbert B. Maw opposed the relocation of any Japanese Americans into the state, stating that if they were such a danger to the West Coast, they would be a danger to Utah.  Most internees arrived at Topaz from the Tanforan or Santa Anita Park holding centers; the majority hailed from the San Francisco Bay Area. Sixty-five percent were Nisei, American citizens born to Japanese immigrants. The camp was governed by Charles F. Ernst until June 1944, when the position was taken over by Luther T. Hoffman following Ernst's resignation.  It was closed on October 31, 1945.\n\nTopaz was originally known as the Central Utah Relocation Authority, and then the Abraham Relocation Authority, but the names were too long for post office regulations. The final name, Topaz, came from Topaz Mountain which overlooks the camp from  away.\n\nTopaz was the primary internment site in the state of Utah.  A smaller camp existed briefly a few miles north of Moab, which was used to isolate a few men considered to be troublemakers prior to their being sent to Leupp, Arizona.  A site at Antelope Springs, in the mountains west of Topaz, was used as a recreation area by the residents and staff of Topaz.\n\nLife\n\nClimate\nMost internees came from the San Francisco Bay Area, which has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, with moist mild winters and dry summers. Topaz had an extreme climate, located at  above sea level in the Sevier Desert. A \"Midlatitude Desert\" under the K\u00f6ppen classification, temperatures could vary greatly throughout the day. The area experienced powerful winds and dust storms. One such storm caused structural damage to 75 buildings in 1944. Temperatures could reach below freezing from mid-September until the end of May. The average temperature in January was . Spring rains turned the clay soil to mud, which bred mosquitoes. Summers were hot, with occasional thunderstorms and temperatures that could exceed . In 1942, the first snowfall occurred on October 13, before camp construction was fully complete.\n\nArchitecture and living arrangements\nTopaz contained a living complex known as the \"city\", about , as well as extensive agricultural lands. Within the city, forty-two blocks were for internees, thirty-four of which were residential. Each residential block housed 200\u2013300 people, housed in barracks that held five people within a single  room. Families were generally housed together, while single adults would be housed with four other unrelated individuals. Residential blocks also contained a recreation hall, a mess hall, an office for the block manager, and a combined laundry/toilet/bathing facility. Each block contained only four bathtubs for all the women and four showers for all the men living there. These packed conditions often resulted in little privacy for residents.\n\nBarracks were built out of wood frame covered in tarpaper, with wooden floors. Many internees moved into the barracks before they were completed, exposing them to harsh weather. Eventually, they were lined with sheetrock, and the floors filled with masonite. While the construction began in July 1942, the first inmates moved in in September 1942, and the camp was not completed until early 1943. Camp construction was completed in part by 214 interned laborers who volunteered to arrive early and help build the camp. Rooms were heated by pot-bellied stoves. There was no furniture provided. Inmates used communal leftover scrap wood from construction to build beds, tables, and cabinets. Some families also modified their living quarters with fabric partitions. Water came from wells and was stored in a large wooden tank, and was \"almost undrinkable\" because of its alkalinity.\n\nTopaz also included a number of communal areas: a high school, two elementary schools, a 28-bed hospital, at least two churches, and a community garden. There was a cemetery as well, although it was never used. All 144 people who died in the camp were cremated and their ashes were held for burial until after the war. The camp was patrolled by 85\u2013150 policemen, and was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Manned watchtowers with searchlights were placed every  surrounding the perimeter of the camp.\n\nDaily life\n\nThe camp was designed to be self-sufficient, and the majority of land within the camp was devoted to farming. Topaz inmates raised cattle, pigs, and chickens in addition to feed crops and vegetables. The vegetables were high-quality and won awards at the Millard County Fair. Due to harsh weather, poor soil, and short growing conditions, the camp was not able to supply all of its animal feed.\n\nTopaz contained two elementary schools: Desert View Elementary and Mountain View Elementary. Topaz High School educated students grades 7\u201312, and there was also an adult education program. The schools were taught by a combination of local teachers and internees. They were under-equipped and overcrowded, but enthusiastic teachers did their best. Topaz High School developed a devoted community, with frequent reunions after internment ended, and a final reunion in 2012. Sports were popular within the schools as well as the adult population, with sports including baseball, basketball, and sumo wrestling. Cultural associations sprung up throughout the camp. Topaz had a newspaper called the Topaz Times, a literary publication called Trek, and two libraries which eventually contained almost 7,000 items in both English and Japanese. Artist Chiura Obata led the Tanforan Art School at Topaz, offering art instruction to over 600 students. Internment rules usurped parental authority, and teenagers often ate meals with their friends and only joined their families to sleep at night.  This combined with a lack of privacy made it difficult for parents to discipline and bond with their children, which contributed to teenage delinquency in the camp.\n\nSome internees were permitted to leave the camp to find employment. In 1942, internees were able to get permission to leave the camp for employment in nearby Delta, where they filled labor shortages caused by the draft, mostly in agricultural labor. In 1943 over 500 internees obtained seasonal agricultural work outside the camp, with another 130 working in domestic and industrial jobs. Polling showed that a majority of Utahns supported this policy. One teacher at the camp art school, Chiura Obata, was allowed to leave Topaz to run classes at nearby universities and churches. \n \nInternees were also sometimes permitted to leave the camp for recreation. A former Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Antelope Springs, in mountains  to the west, was taken over as a recreation area for internees and camp staff, and two buildings from Antelope Springs were brought to the central area to be used as Buddhist and Christian churches. During a rock hunting expedition in the Drum Mountains,  west of Topaz, Akio Uhihera and Yoshio Nishimoto discovered and excavated a  rare iron meteorite, which the Smithsonian Institution acquired.\n\nCamp politics\n\nIn 1943, the War Relocation Authority (WRA) issued all adult internees a questionnaire assessing their level of Americanization. It was entitled \"Application for Leave Clearance\". Questions asked about what language they spoke most frequently, their religion, and recreational activities. Participating in judo and kendo were \"Japanese\" activities, while playing baseball or being Christian were considered \"American\". Two questions asked prisoners if they were willing to fight in the US Armed Forces and if they would swear allegiance to the United States and renounce loyalty to the Emperor of Japan. Many Japanese-born Issei, who were barred from attaining American citizenship, resented the second question, feeling that an affirmative answer would leave them effectively stateless. Some Issei volunteered to join the army, even though there was no enlistment procedure for non-citizens. Others objected on other political grounds. In Topaz, nearly a fifth of male residents answered \"no\" to the question about allegiance. Inmates expressed their anger through a few scattered assaults against other inmates who they perceived as too close to the administration. Chiura Obata was among those attacked, resulting in his immediate release for fear of further assaults. A reworded version of the questionnaire for Issei did not require them to renounce their loyalty to the emperor of Japan. In response to the questionnaires, some Nisei formed the Resident Council for Japanese American Civil Rights, which encouraged other prisoners to register for the draft if their civil rights were restored.\n\nA military sentry fatally shot 63-year-old chef James Hatsuaki Wakasa on April 11, 1943, while he was walking his dog inside the camp fence. Internees went on strike protesting the death and surrounding secrecy. They held a large funeral for Wakasa as a way to express their outrage. In response, the administration determined that fears of subversive activity at the camp were largely without basis, and significantly relaxed security. The military decided that officers who had been at war in the Pacific would not be assigned to guard duty at Topaz. The guard who shot Wakasa was reassigned after being found not guilty of violating military law; this information was not given to internees.\n\nTopaz internees Fred Korematsu and Mitsuye Endo challenged their internment in court. Korematsu's case was heard and rejected at the US Supreme Court (Korematsu v. United States), the largest case to challenge internment, while Endo's case was upheld.\n\nAfter closing\n\nAfter Topaz was closed, the land was sold and most of the buildings were auctioned off, disassembled, and removed from the site. Even the water pipes and utility poles were sold. Numerous foundations, concrete-lined excavations and other ground-level features can be seen at the various sites, but few buildings remain, and natural vegetation has taken over most of the abandoned areas.\n\nIn 1976, the Japanese American Citizens League placed a monument on the northwestern corner of the central area. On March 29, 2007, United States Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne designated \"Central Utah Relocation Center Site\" a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1982, Delta High School teacher Jane Beckwith and her journalism students began to study Topaz. She spearheaded the creation of the Topaz Museum Board in 1983, which oversaw the Topaz Museum, which initially shared space with the Great Basin Museum. Funding from the Japanese-American Confinement Sites organization enabled the Topaz Board to construct its own museum building in 2013. In 2015, the museum formally opened with an exhibition of art created at Topaz, entitled \"When Words Weren't Enough: Works on Paper from Topaz, 1942\u20131945\". The museum closed for remodeling in November 2016, and reopened in 2017 as a traditional museum focused on the history of Topaz. By 2017, the Topaz Museum and Board had purchased 634 of the 640 acres of the original internment site.\n\nIn media\n\nIn film\nUsing a smuggled camera, Dave Tatsuno shot film of Topaz. The documentary Topaz uses film he shot from 1943 to 1945. This film was an inductee of the 1997 National Film Registry list, with the added distinction of being the second \"home movie\" to be included on the Registry and the only color footage of camp life.\n\nTopaz War Relocation Center is the setting for the 2007 film American Pastime, a dramatization based on actual events, which tells the story of Nikkei baseball in the camps.  A portion of the camp was duplicated for location shooting in Utah's Skull Valley, approximately  west of Salt Lake City and  north of the actual Topaz site. The film used some of Tatsuno's historical footage. In addition to Tatsuno's Topaz, Ken Verdoia made a 1987 documentary, also entitled Topaz.\n\nIn literature\nYoshiko Uchida's young adult novel Journey to Topaz (published in 1971) recounts the story of Yuki, a young Japanese American girl, whose world is disrupted when, shortly after Pearl Harbor, she and her family must leave their comfortable home in the Berkeley, California suburbs for the dusty barracks of Topaz.  The book is largely based on Uchida's personal experiences: she and her family were interned at Topaz for three years.\n\nJulie Otsuka's novel When the Emperor was Divine (published in 2002) tells the story of a family forced to relocate from Berkeley to Topaz in September 1942. Each of the novel's five chapters is told from the point of view of a different character. Critics praised the book's \"precise but poetic evocation of the ordinary\" and \"ability to empathize\".\n\nIn his poetry collection Topaz (published in 2013), Brian Komei Dempster examines the experience of his mother and her family, tying the history of persecution and internment to subsequent generations\u2019 search for a 21st-century identity.\n\nIn art\nMuch of the art made by detainees at the camp depicted life there, and survives. Drawings and woodcuts by Chiura Obata and Matsusabur\u014d (George) Hibi are among the most prominent. Some of it is collected in The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps, 1942\u20131946 by Delphine Hirasuna, and has been exhibited in Topaz and at the Wight Art Gallery. In 2018, the Utah Museum of Fine Arts exhibited many Chiura Obata's works, including some made at Topaz.\n\nSee also \n\n Japanese American Internment\n List of inmates of Topaz War Relocation Center\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Topaz Museum digital archive, with links to photographs of camp, The Topaz Times, and the elementary school diary\n\nArchival links\nPapers from non-internee people at Topaz from the L.

The facility consisted of four main areas: the Topaz camp itself, the Central Utah Correctional Facility, the Tule Lake camp in Northern California, and the Crystal City camp in Texas. The Topaz camp was the largest of the three facilities. The Topaz camp was designed to hold 10,000 people, but by the end of World War II, nearly 13,000 people were held there. The majority of the internees were from the West Coast of the United States, with a large number from California. The camp was located in an area that was mostly desert, with temperatures reaching over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) in the summer and dropping to or below freezing in the winter. Topaz was a \"relocation camp,\" which meant that the people were not held prisoner and were free to leave. However, they were not allowed to travel more than 5 miles (8.0 km) from the camp without permission, and they were not allowed to own any personal property. The people at Topaz were allowed to work in the camp, and many of them worked in the camp's laundry, sewing, and mess hall. Many of the people at Topaz were farmers and fishermen before they were relocated, and they were able to continue these activities at the camp. In addition to the main Topaz camp, there were also several satellite camps located nearby. The largest of these was the Central Utah Correctional Facility, which was a minimum-security prison. The prison was built to house Japanese Americans who were considered to be a threat to national security. The prison was designed to hold 400 people, but by the end of the war, it was holding nearly 800 people. The Topaz War Relocation Center was closed in January 1945, and the people who were held there were allowed to return to their homes. Many of the people who were held at Topaz were able to return to their homes, but many of them were unable to return to their former homes and had to find new homes and jobs.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4485937}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bengalia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bengalia is a genus of blow flies in the family Calliphoridae with one authority considering the genus to belong to a separate family Bengaliidae. These bristly and, unlike the greens and blues of most calliphorids, dull coloured flies, are especially noted for their relationship to ants. Little is known of their biology and life-cycle, although adults of many species are kleptoparasitic on ants and will snatch food and pupae being carried by ants or feed on winged termites.\nThe apt name \u201cHighwayman Fly\u201d was given by an early observer of their way of robbing ants.\nVery little is known about their breeding habits. The genus is found in the Afrotropical and oriental region with one species from Australia possibly a recent introduction.\n\nDescription\nMost of the species have a yellow or brown ground-colour, an antero-posteriorly compressed head, stout mouthparts, a projecting clypeus below the lower facial margin, and have a silent flight.\n\nBehaviour\nBengalia flies are best known for their remarkable highwayman-like habit of robbing ant pupae from ants moving on ant roads.\nWith respect to Bengalia depressa this habit is described as follows: \u201c[The flies were] settling on blades of grass, stones, and other raised objects near the ant column. ... When any ant made a little circuit away from the main body, a fly would generally pursue it at a distance of about half an inch, but back away as soon as the ant turned towards it. ... Eventually Lamborn saw a fly stalk a minor ant carrying a pupa in its jaws. Suddenly the fly rushed forward and apparently pierced the pupa bringing the ant up with a sharp jerk. The two insects then had a tug of war with very little advantage to either side, until the ant apparently became annoyed and letting go of the pupa rushed at the fly, which escaped with the booty which it proceeded to suck. Then he saw a fly swoop down on the ant column and rise at once with a pupa and attendant ant, both of which it dropped after carrying them for about a foot. The ant, however, still held on and started to run off with its charge. The fly caught it again and this time rose three feet in the air and then dropped ant and pupa again. This time the ant left the pupa which the fly immediately seized and proceeded to suck.\u201d\n\nSpecies\n\nBengalia africana Malloch, 1927\nBengalia africanoides Rognes\nBengalia akamanga (Lehrer)\nBengalia aliena Malloch, 1927\nBengalia asymmetria Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia bantuphalla (Lehrer)\nBengalia bezzii Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia calilungae Rueda, 1985\nBengalia chekiangensis Fan\nBengalia chiangmaiensis Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia chromatella S\u00e9guy, 1946\nBengalia concava Malloch, 1927\nBengalia cuthbertsoni Zumpt, 1956 \nBengalia depressa Walker, 1858\nBengalia emarginata Malloch\nBengalia emarginatoides Rognes\nBengalia emdeniella (Lehrer)\nBengalia escheri Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia fani Feng & Wei\nBengalia favillacea (Walker)\nBengalia fernandiella Lehrer\nBengalia floccosa Wulp\nBengalia fuscipennis Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia gaillardi Sourcouf & Guyon, 1912 - Synonyms:B. spurca Brauer & Bergenstamm, 1891, B. spurca Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia gigas Macquart\nBengalia hastativentris Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia hobbyi Senior-White, 1940\nBengalia inermis Malloch, 1927\nBengalia jejuna Fabricius\nBengalia kanoi Kurahashi & Magpayo, 2000\nBengalia kuyanianus Matsumura\nBengalia labiata Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830\nBengalia lampunia Lehrer\nBengalia lateralis Macquart\nBengalia latro Meijere\nBengalia lyneborgi James, 1966\nBengalia martinleakei Senior-White, 1930\nBengalia minor Malloch, 1927\nBengalia nirvanella Lehrer\nBengalia pallidicoxa Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia peuhi Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia pseudovaricolor Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia pygomalaya Lehrer\nBengalia racovitzai (Lehrer)\nBengalia recurva Malloch, 1927\nBengalia robertsi Kurahashi, 1987\nBengalia roubaudi Rickenbach, Hamon & Mochet, 1960\nBengalia semerunia Lehrer\nBengalia seniorwhitei (Lehrer)\nBengalia siamensis Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia smarti (Lehrer)\nBengalia spinifemorata Villeneuve, 1913\nBengalia subnitida James, 1964\nBengalia surcoufi Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia taiwanensis Fan, 1965\nBengalia taksina (Lehrer)\nBengalia tibiaria Villeneuve, 1926\nBengalia torosa Wiedemann\nBengalia unicolor Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia varicolor Fabricius, 1805\nBengalia wangariae (Lehrer)\nBengalia weii Rognes\nBengalia wyatti (Lehrer)\nBengalia xanthopyga Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia zhangi (Lehrer & Wei)\n\nTaxonomic dispute\nThe genus was reclassified into 11 new genera in 4 subfamilies by Andy Lehrer in 2005, within a newly designated family, Bengaliidae. The family designation was disputed by Rognes (2006) who noted that it was equivalent to the already established tribe Bengaliini (now the subfamily Bengaliinae), and that treating it as a family renders the Calliphoridae paraphyletic.  Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work adds 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species are treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.). Additional names published by Lehrer have since been synonymized, with 120 new synonymies established in a single review in 2020.\n\nThis dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states \"The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.\" Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.\n\nReferences\n\nCalliphoridae\nOestroidea genera\nTaxa named by Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy", "machine_text": " Bengalia (B\u00f4ngol), also known as Bangala, is a region of West Bengal, India.

In the 20th century, the name was changed to Plaza Venezuela in honor of the country's independence, with the addition of a large statue of Simon Bolivar, one of the Liberators of Spanish America, on the southern side of the square. Plaza Venezuela is one of the few plazas in Caracas that is not surrounded by buildings, allowing for a clear view of the mountains that surround the city. It is a frequent gathering place for political rallies and celebrations. One of the most recognizable features of the Plaza is the La Guairita Hotel, better known as the Water Tower, a 150-meter (500 ft) tower with a spherical tank on the top, which supplies water to the city. The Plaza is also home to the Church of San Francisco, the National Library, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Central University of Venezuela (UCV). Under the square, there is a large underground shopping mall, the Centenary Walkway, which was built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of Caracas. At the eastern side of the square is the Parque Central complex, which includes the Hilton Hotel, the Caracas Stock Exchange, and the offices of some of the most important banks in the country. The complex is also the home of the Telef\u00e9polis building, which was the first multi-story building in the country to have a glass facade.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43629485}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Larry Eustachy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Larry Robert Eustachy (born December 1, 1955) is an American college basketball coach, most recently the head coach of the Colorado State Rams  He was previously the head coach at Idaho      and  \n\nEustachy was the AP Coach of the Year in 2000 after leading Iowa State to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament.\n\nCoaching career\n\nIdaho\nAt age 34, Eustachy became a head coach at Idaho in April 1990, succeeding Kermit Davis, who left the Palouse for Texas A&M after consecutive Big Sky titles and NCAA tournament appearances. He had been an assistant in Moscow for a season (1986\u201387) under Tim Floyd, and Eustachy's first-year salary as head coach was $52,500. In his third year, he led the Vandals to the regular season championship in 1993, but they lost the tourney title game at home. Idaho was not selected for the NIT, and Eustachy departed a few days later.\n\nUtah State\nEustachy took over the reins in Logan in March 1993, and had a very successful five-year stretch at Utah State; his teams won the Big West regular season three times and won the conference tournament in 1998. The Aggies were seeded thirteenth in the West region of the NCAA tournament, and fell to Maryland in the first round at Sacramento.\n\nIowa State\nEustachy was named head coach at Iowa State in late July 1998, after Tim Floyd left for the NBA's Chicago Bulls. Following a lackluster first season, the Cyclones had their best season in school history in 2000. They won a school record 32 games and came within one game of the Final Four, and Eustachy was named AP Coach of the Year. After consecutive Big 12 Conference titles in 2001, he signed a contract extension that, with incentives, made him the highest-paid state employee in Iowa.\n\nSuspension and resignation\nOn April 28, 2003, The Des Moines Register carried pictures of Eustachy kissing several young women and holding a beer at a party near the University of Missouri's campus just hours after the Tigers defeated his Cyclones on Tuesday, January 21. The Register also reported that Eustachy had been seen at a fraternity party at Kansas State hours after his team lost to the Wildcats. On April 30, athletic director Bruce Van De Velde suspended Eustachy with pay and recommended that he be fired for violating a morals clause in his contract. Eustachy held a press conference in which he apologized for his behavior and admitted he had recently begun rehab treatment for alcoholism. He initially indicated he would contest the suspension, but announced his resignation on May 5.\n\nDuring the scandal, the Register reported that Iowa State documents showed that the NCAA cited Eustachy for rules violations related to paying players, including Jackson Vroman, for making free throws.\n\nSouthern Mississippi\nOn March 25, 2004, after a year out of coaching, Eustachy was hired as head coach at Southern Miss. In 2008, he took a leave of absence on January 9 to be with his ailing mother. Following the 2008\u201309 season, he returned his $25,000 bonus from the university, saying that after a disappointing season, he did not feel as though he had earned it.\n\nIn 2011, Southern Miss went 21\u201310 and 9\u20137 in Conference USA play.  The team failed to receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament and turned down invites to the CBI and CIT.\n\nOn February 25, 2012, Eustachy recorded his 400th career victory.\n\nColorado State\nOn April 12, 2012, Eustachy left Southern Miss and was introduced as the 19th head basketball coach in Colorado State history, after Tim Miles left for Nebraska of the Big Ten Conference. Eustachy inherited a senior-laden roster that featured four returning starters and Minnesota-transfer Colton Iverson. The Rams were coming off a 20\u201312 season in which they made the NCAA Tournament and lost to Murray State in the second round. CSU greatly improved in rebounding and defensively, leading to a historic season for the program. CSU cracked the top 25 rankings for the first time since 1954 during the season. At 11\u20135 the Rams finished second in the Mountain West, their highest finish in program history. For the second straight year, the Rams earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, this time as a No. 8 seed against Missouri. The Rams defeated the Tigers 84\u201372 to give Eustachy his first NCAA Tournament win since the Elite Eight run at Iowa State. It was CSU's first Tournament win since 1989 and a program record 26th win. CSU lost in the third round to top-seeded Louisville, ending the season 26\u20139.\n\nIn August 2013, Eustachy signed a new contract to become the highest-paid coach in the Mountain West Conference. He has a base salary of $910,000 per year and will increase by two percent each following season, along with bonuses on top of it.\n\nIn 2017, Eustachy recorded his 500th career victory on January 7. On March 5, he was named Mountain West Conference Coach of the year, after leading a CSU team with only seven available players to a second place conference finish in the MWC.\n\nIn February 2017, The Coloradoan revealed that a 2014 Colorado State internal investigation recommended Eustachy's firing due to creating a culture of fear and intimidation by emotionally and verbally abusing his players and staff. However, Colorado State retained Eustachy and required him to attend anger management sessions, apologize to his team, and follow a zero-tolerance policy for directing profane language towards others or throwing or hitting objects, for which violations would result in termination for cause.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, Colorado State placed Eustachy on administrative leave and promoted associate head coach Steve Barnes to interim head coach pending the completion of another inquiry into Eustachy's behavior. Colorado State confirmed the existence of that second investigation three days earlier on January 31; Eustachy resigned on February 26.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Southern Miss profile\n \n Sports-Reference.com \u2013 Larry Eustachy\n\n1955 births\nLiving people\nAmerican men's basketball coaches\nAmerican men's basketball players\nBasketball coaches from California\nBasketball players from California\nBall State Cardinals men's basketball coaches\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach alumni\nCitrus Owls men's basketball coaches\nCitrus Owls men's basketball players\nCollege basketball controversies in the United States\nCollege men's basketball head coaches in the United States\nColorado State Rams men's basketball coaches\nIdaho Vandals men's basketball coaches\nIowa State Cyclones men's basketball coaches\nMississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball coaches\nSportspeople from Alameda, California\nPeople from Arcadia, California\nSouthern Miss Golden Eagles basketball coaches\nUtah State Aggies men's basketball coaches\nUtah Utes men's basketball coaches", "machine_text": " Larry Eustachy (born August 8, 1961) is an American college basketball coach and a former player.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Polyarchy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In political science, the term polyarchy ( \"many\", arkhe \"rule\") was used by Robert A. Dahl to describe a form of government in which power is invested in multiple people. It takes the form of neither a dictatorship nor a democracy. This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and gradually adopted by other countries. According to Dahl, the fundamental democratic principle is \"the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals\" with unimpaired opportunities. A polyarchy is a state that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the democratic principle.\n\nIn semblance, the word \"polycracy\" describes the same form of government, although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a state ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a monocracy. The word derives from Greek poly (\"many\") and kratos (\"rule\" or \"strength\").\n\nDefinitions \nDahl's original theory of polyarchal democracy is in his 1956 book A Preface to Democratic Theory. His theory evolved over the decades, and the description in later writings is somewhat different.\n\nDahl argues that \"democracy\" is an ideal type that no country has ever achieved. For Dahl, democracy is a system that is \"completely responsive to all its citizens\", and the closest to the democratic ideal any country can come is polyarchy.\n\nA Preface to Democratic Theory \nIn the book, Dahl gives eight conditions that measure the extent to which majority rule is in effect in an organization. These are (p. 84):\n\nEvery member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting.\nIn tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to each individual is identical.\nThe alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice.\nAny member who perceives a set of alternatives, at least one of which he regards as preferable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting.\nAll individuals possess identical information about the alternatives.\nAlternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alternatives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes.\nThe orders of elected officials are executed.\nEither all interelection decisions are subordinate or executory to those arrived at during the election stage, i.e., elections are in a sense controlling; or new decisions during the interelection period are governed by the preceding seven conditions, operating, however, under rather different institutional circumstances; or both.\n\nDahl hypothesized that each of these conditions can be quantified, and suggested the term \"polyarchy\" to describe an organization that scores high on the scales for all the eight conditions.\n\nDahl viewed polyarchy as a system that manages to supply a high level of inclusiveness and a high level of liberalization to its citizens.\n\nDemocracy and its critics \nIn his 1989 book Democracy and Its Critics, Dahl gives the following characteristics of a polyarchy (p. 233):\n\nControl over governmental decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in elected officials.\nElected officials are chosen and peacefully removed in relatively frequent, fair and free elections in which coercion is quite limited.\nPractically all adults have the right to vote in these elections.\nMost adults also have the right to run for the public offices for which candidates run in these elections.\nCitizens have an effectively enforced right to freedom of expression, particularly political expression, including criticism of the officials, the conduct of the government, the prevailing political, economic, and social system, and the dominant ideology.\nThey also have access to alternative sources of information that are not monopolized by the government or any other single group.\nFinally, they have an effectively enforced right to form and join autonomous associations, including political associations, such as political parties and interest groups, that attempt to influence the government by competing in elections and by other peaceful means.\n\nCharacteristics \nPolyarchy and its procedures may be insufficient for achieving full democracy. For example, poor people may be unable to participate in the political process. Some authors see polyarchy as a form of government that is not intended for greater social justice or cultural realization or to allow the repressed to politically participate.\n\nAccording to William I. Robinson, it is a system where a small group actually rules on behalf of capital, and the majority\u2019s decision-making is confined to choosing among a select number of elites within tightly controlled elective processes. It is a form of consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital, which allows concentration of political power. Robert A. Dahl and Charles E. Lindblom noted that political bargaining is an essential feature of polyarchy, particularly in the US.\n\nMoreover, a perceived polyarchy\u2014such as the United States\u2014may bar a substantial number of its citizens from participating in its electoral process. For example, more than four million U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are excluded from participating in the election of any voting member of Congress, the political body that holds ultimate sovereignty over them. Robinson argues that they are effectively taxed without lawful representation (although these territories' status is a matter of popular consensus in individual cases).\n\nIn Preface to Democratic Theory (1956), Dahl argues that an increase in citizen political involvement may not always be beneficial for polyarchy. An increase in the political participation of members of less educated classes, for example, could reduce the support for the basic norms of polyarchy, because members of those classes are more predisposed to be authoritarian-minded.\n\nIn a discussion of contemporary British foreign policy, Mark Curtis writes, \"Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of promoting 'democracy' abroad. This is a system in which a small group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing leaders in elections managed by competing elites.\"\n\nIt is also being promoted by the transnational elites in the South as a different form from the authoritarianism and dictatorship to the North as a part of democracy promotion. Robinson argues that this is to cultivate transnational elites who will open up their countries following the transnational agenda of neoliberalism, whereby transnational capital mobility and globalized circuits of production and distribution are established. For example, it was promoted to Nicaragua, Chile, Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries.\n\nSee also \n\n Civil society\n Governance\n State/Space theory\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n  Full text.\n \n \n \n  \n  Pdf.\n \n \n\nComparative politics\nDemocracy\nPolitical science theories\nDictatorship\nPower sharing", "machine_text": " Polyarchy In political science, polyarchy (from the Greek: \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2, poly (\"many\") and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, kratos (\"power\")) is a form of government in which citizens exercise political power. Polyarchy is a broader concept than democracy, as it refers to the structure of the government and not to the method of voting. In a democracy, the government is run directly by the people who are voting for a specific candidate, party, or policy. In a polyarchy, the people elect representatives to create and vote on policies. Representative democracy is a form of polyarchy. Aristotle's Politics describes two forms of government: the state, or regime, and the constitution. The state is the ruling body, and the constitution is the legal basis for the state's existence. Constitution refers to the way in which the ruling body is organized, including the government's powers and the way that citizens are governed. For example, the United States Constitution provides for three branches of government\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014and provides ways for changing the constitution itself. In a polyarchy, the ruling body, or state, has multiple power centers. A pure form of polyarchy doesn't exist because all nations have a head of state who has more power than the other members of the ruling body. In the United States, for example, the president has more power than the speaker of the House or the majority leader of the Senate. Even so, the United States is a polyarchy, because the people elect multiple representatives who have some level of political power. Citizen participation in a polyarchy can take many forms: voting for representatives, joining a political party, or participating in interest groups that advocate for specific causes. In a polyarchy, the people are not always involved in the political process but can become involved by contacting their representatives, voting, or joining a political party or interest group.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1081047}

Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships to low-income children in Washington D.C. for tuition and other fees at participating private schools. The program was the first Federally funded school voucher program in the United States. It was first approved in 2003 and allowed to expire for the first time in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was reauthorized under the SOAR Act in 2011, but again defunded at the end of the second Obama presidency.  The program was reinstated under President Trump.\n\nBackground\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush signed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide scholarships to students from low-income families to attend a private school of choice. The program targeted 2,000 children from low-income families in Washington D.C. These children were given funding to help offset the cost of private schooling. In 2008, the program funded attendance at 54 D.C. private schools for students from families with an average income of $22,736, \"or about 107 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four.\"\n\nIn 2009 the program faced a phase out with President Barack Obama's 2009 budget proposal cutting all funding for the program and including language to prohibit any new students from receiving scholarships.\n\nIn 2011, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senator Joe Lieberman introduced the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act to restore funding for the program and again allow new students to participate. The entirety of the SOAR Act was included in the 2011 long-term continuing resolution, the passage of which resulted in a five-year reauthorization of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The 2004 legislation had permitted students to receive scholarships of up to $7,500, whereas the 2011 bill provides scholarships of up to $8,000 for students in kindergarten through eighth grade and up to $12,000 for students in grades 9-12.\n\nIn February 2012, President Barack Obama announced his budget proposal for 2013, which did not include new funding for the program. According to ABC News, the budget stated that the program's budget for 2012 had enough money to also cover students' vouchers in 2013, but did not mention future years. The lack of funding was criticized by conservatives, including The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley, who argued that the program costs less per child and has a higher graduation rate than public schools in Washington D.C.\n\nProgram Administrator \nBetween 2004 and 2010, the Washington Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit group, administered the program, which was funded at $12 million a year.\n\nAs of May 2010, the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation is serving as the administrator of the  D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program is appropriated to receive $20 million per year,  beginning in the 2012-13 school year.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, board members of the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation voted to dissolve the organization because of debt caused by large staff costs, including misuse of the organization's credit cards. By cutting employees' salaries, abandoning its office lease, and cutting other costs, the organization will try to deliver some of the promised grant funding in 2016.\n\nFunding Status\n\n2011 \n Appropriation: $17,369,000\n\n2010 \n Appropriation: $13,200,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n\n2009 \n Appropriations: $14,000,000\n\n2008 \n Appropriations: $14,800,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,694,186\n\n2007 \n Appropriations: $13,860,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,454,200\n\n2006 \n Appropriations: $13,860,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,454,200\n\n2005 \n Appropriations: $13,888,000\n\n2004 \n Appropriations: $13,917,400\n\nNote: FY 2004 was the first year of funding for this program.

Williams, former D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous and former D.C. Board of Education president Peggy Cooper Cafritz. It was opposed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray.\n\nIn 2010, a randomized controlled trial conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students. While the study reported that there \"is no conclusive evidence that the OSP affected student achievement,\" the program was found to have a significant impact on graduation rates. Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%. By comparison, the rate for students who did not receive vouchers was only 70%. The study received the Department of Education's highest rating for scientific rigor. Over 90% of the study's participants were African American, and most of the remainder were Latino American.\n\nFurther research found that students who received vouchers were 25% more likely to enroll in college than students with similar demographic characteristics who did not receive vouchers.\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States federal education legislation", "machine_text": " D.C.

In 1986 the observatory building was passed to Turun Ursa, also founded by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4. The land of the observatory was rented from a local farmer until 2002, when Turun Ursa received a grant from Viljo, Yrj\u00f6 ja Kalle V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4n rahasto (Viljo, Yrj\u00f6 and Kalle V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 Fund) to purchase the land.\n\nAstronomical instruments \n\nThe observatory dome houses a 50\u00a0cm anastigmatic Schmidt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 camera, which was earlier located at Iso-Heikkil\u00e4 Observatory, where it was used in an asteroid hunt to find 807 minor planets and 7 comets. The telescope has a 50\u00a0cm corrector menisculus and a 60\u00a0cm primary mirror with focal length of 1031\u00a0mm. It has a 6.7 degree field of view on 12x12 cm film plates, making it ideal for searching asteroids. Attached to the main telescope are two guide telescopes: an 18\u00a0cm and an 8\u00a0cm refractor.\n\nThe zenith tower originally housed a 250/5150\u00a0mm zenith telescope that was used to observe the movements of the axis of the earth. After the T\u00e4htitieteellis-optillinen seura was ended, the telescope was moved to Tuorla Observatory.

Its body and dorsal forewings are a deep green color. The dorsal hindwings have purple-blue patches, yellow borders, and a red spot near the inner margin. The underside is yellow green and gray purple. Like most moths in the family Sphingidae, caterpillars pupate in burrows. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found from Argentina north through Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies to Florida, Mississippi, South Texas, Arizona, and Colombia. Occasionally winds carry them to other places, such as Missouri, southern Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maine, and southern Saskatchewan.\n\nLife cycle\nFemale adults lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plant, mainly grapes (Vitis), and vine (Cissus). Caterpillars hatch and start eating, resembling the head of a snake. When they are ready to pupate, they climb down their host plant and burrow underground. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone odor plume.

The group was formed by three British musicians (Michael Chant, Steve Beresford, and John Zorn) and three French musicians (Christian Clozier, Robert Aichinger, and Daniel Teruggi) with the addition of the Belgian Gunter Sommer. The group's music was an attempt to bridge the gap between free jazz and free improvisation, two traditions which had previously been worlds apart. The musicians sought to combine the powerful, structured, and directed sound of free jazz with the more open-ended and spontaneous approach of free improvisation. To achieve this, the group used a unique rehearsal method, in which the musicians would sit in a circle and play together for hours at a time, without any pre-written music or conduction. This approach allowed the musicians to develop a strong group dynamic and a collective, organic sound. The group's music was characterized by its use of drones, noise, and repetitive patterns, and by its playful and intuitive approach to composition and structure. The group's first album, 4 (Ensemble) Compositions, was released in 1992, and featured four extended compositions, each of which was named after the four elements. The album was recorded live at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle in Paris, and was released on the Italian Black Saint label. 4 (Ensemble) Compositions was well received by critics, and was praised for its unique approach to composition and its powerful, organic sound. The album was also noted for its strong emotional and spiritual content, which was seen as a refreshing change from the more cerebral and abstract approach of many free jazz and free improvisation groups.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31928127}

Toporov, and other scholars.\n\nMorris Swadesh included all of the members of Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian in a family that he called \"Basque-Dennean\" (when writing in English, 2006/1971: 223) or \"vascodene\" (when writing in Spanish, 1959: 114). It was named for Basque and Navajo, the languages at its geographic extremes. According to Swadesh (1959: 114), it included \"Basque, the Caucasian languages, Ural-Altaic, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Chinese, Austronesian, Japanese, Chukchi (Siberia), Eskimo-Aleut, Wakash, and Na-Dene\", and possibly \"Sumerian\". Swadesh's Basque-Dennean thus differed from Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian in including (1) Uralic, Altaic, Japanese, Chukotian, and Eskimo-Aleut (languages which are classed as Eurasiatic by the followers of Sergei Starostin and those of Joseph Greenberg), (2) Dravidian, which is classed as Nostratic by Starostin's school, and (3) Austronesian (which according to Starostin is indeed related to Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian, but only at the next stage up, which he termed Den\u00e9\u2013Daic, and only via Austric (see Starostin's Borean macrofamily)). Swadesh's colleague Mary Haas attributes the origin of the Basque-Dennean hypothesis to Edward Sapir.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sergei Starostin, using strict linguistic methods (proposing regular phonological correspondences, reconstructions, glottochronology, etc.), became the first to put the idea that the Caucasian, Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan languages are related on firmer ground. In 1991, Sergei L. Nikolaev added the Na-Den\u00e9 languages to Starostin's classification.\n\nThe inclusion of the Na-Den\u00e9 languages has been somewhat complicated by the ongoing dispute over whether Haida belongs to the family. The proponents of the Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian hypothesis incline towards supporters of Haida's membership in Na-Den\u00e9, such as Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Pinnow or, most recently, John Enrico. Edward J. Vajda, who otherwise rejects the Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian hypothesis, has suggested that Tlingit, Eyak, and the Athabaskan languages are closely related to the Yeniseian languages, but he denies any genetic relationship of the former three to Haida. Vajda's ideas on the relationship of Athabaskan\u2013Eyak\u2013Tlingit and Yeniseian have found support independently in works of various authors, including Heinrich K. Werner or Merritt Ruhlen. DNA analyses have not shown any special connection between the modern Ket population and the modern speakers of the Na-Den\u00e9 languages.\n\nIn 1996, John D. Bengtson added the Vasconic languages (including Basque, its extinct relative or ancestor Aquitanian, and possibly Iberian), and in 1997 he proposed the inclusion of Burushaski. The same year, in his article for Mother Tongue, Bengtson concluded that Sumerian might have been a remnant of a distinct subgroup of the Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages. However, two other papers on the genetic affinity of Sumerian appeared in the same volume: while Allan R. Bomhard considered Sumerian to be a sister of Nostratic, Igor M. Diakonoff compared it to the Munda languages.\n\nIn 1998, Vitaly V. Shevoroshkin rejected the Amerind affinity of the Almosan (Algonquian-Wakashan) languages, suggesting instead that they had a relationship with Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian. Several years later, he offered a number of lexical and phonological correspondences between the North Caucasian, Salishan, and Wakashan languages, concluding that Salishan and Wakashan may represent a distinct branch of North Caucasian and that their separation from it must postdate the dissolution of the Northeast Caucasian unity (Avar-Andi-Tsezian), which took place around the 2nd or 3rd millennium BC.\n\nEvidence for Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian\n\nThe existence of Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian is supported by:\n\n Many words that correspond between some or all of the families referred to Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian.\n The presence in the shared vocabulary of words that are rarely borrowed or otherwise replaced, such as personal pronouns (see below).\n Elements of grammar, such as verb prefixes and their positions (see below), noun class prefixes (see below), and case suffixes that are shared between at least some of the component families.\n A reconstruction of the sound system, the basic parts of the grammar, and much of the vocabulary of the macrofamily's most recent common ancestor, the so-called Proto-Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian language.\n\nPotential problems include:\n\n The somewhat heavy reliance on the reconstruction of Proto-(North-)Caucasian by Starostin and Nikolayev. This reconstruction contains much uncertainty due to the extreme complexity of the sound systems of the Caucasian languages; the sound correspondences between these languages are difficult to trace.\n The use of the reconstruction of Proto-Sino-Tibetan by Peiros and Starostin, parts of which have been criticized on various grounds, although Starostin himself has proposed a few revisions. All reconstructions of Proto-Sino-Tibetan suffer from the facts that many languages of the huge Sino-Tibetan family are underresearched and that the shape of the Sino-Tibetan tree is poorly known and partly controversial.\n The use of Starostin's reconstruction of Proto-Yeniseian rather than the competing one by Vajda or that by Werner.\n The use of Bengtson's reconstruction of Proto-/Pre-Basque rather than Trask's.\n The slow progress in the reconstruction of Proto-Na-Den\u00e9, so that Haida and Athabaskan\u2013Eyak\u2013Tlingit have so far mostly been considered separately.\n\nShared pronominal morphemes\nSeveral roots can be reconstructed for the 1st and 2nd person singular pronouns. This may indicate that there were pronouns with irregular declension (suppletion) in Proto-Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian, like \"I\" vs \"me\" throughout Indo-European. In the presumed daughter languages some of the roots are often affixes (such as verb prefixes or possessive noun prefixes) instead of independent pronouns.\n\nThe Algic, Salishan, Wakashan, and Sumerian comparisons should be regarded as especially tentative because regular sound correspondences between these families and the more often accepted Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian families have not yet been reconstructed. To a lesser degree this also holds for the Na-Den\u00e9 comparisons, where only a few sound correspondences have yet been published.\n\n/V/ means that the vowel in this position has not been successfully reconstructed. /K/ could have been any velar or uvular plosive, /S/ could have been any sibilant or assibilate.\n\nAll except Algic, Salishan and Wakashan are taken from Bengtson (2008).\n\nFootnotes:\n1 On Caucasian evidence alone, this word cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Caucasian or even Proto-East Caucasian; it is only found in Lak and Dargwa (Bengtson 2008:94). \n2 The final  found in Sumerian pronouns is the ergative ending. The Emesal dialect has . \n3 Proto-Athabaskan , Haida dii . \n4 Also in Proto-Southern Wakashan.\n5 1st pl.. \n6 Tlingit xa , Eyak -, . \n7 Masculine verb prefix. \n8 Proto-Athabaskan -, Tlingit \u00ffi  > yi  = 2nd pl.; Tlingit i , Eyak  \"thou\". \n9 Feminine verb prefix. \n10 Proto-Athabaskan -, Haida dang /d\u00e0\u014b/, Tlingit wa.\u00e9 , where the hypothesis of a connection between the Proto-Athabaskan and Haida forms on the one hand and the rest on the other hand requires ad hoc assumptions of assimilation and dissimilation (Bengtson 2008: 94). \n11 Feminine. \n12 Proto-Athabaskan -, Eyak -, Tlingit w\u00e9 , Haida 'wa . \n13 2nd sg.\n\nShared noun class pre- and infixes\n\nNoun classification occurs in the North Caucasian languages, Burushaski, Yeniseian, and the Na-Den\u00e9 languages. In Basque and Sino-Tibetan, only fossilized vestiges of the prefixes remain. One of the prefixes, */s/-, seems to be abundant in Haida, though again fossilized.\n\nThe following table with its footnotes, except for Burushaski, is taken from Bengtson (2008).\n\nFootnotes:\na In Basque, the class prefixes became fossilized.\nb In many Caucasian languages (28), systems of this type more or less persist to this day, especially in the East Caucasian languages, whereas in West Caucasian, only Abkhaz and Abaza preserve a distinction human-nonhuman. The Roman numbers are those conventionally used for the East Caucasian noun classes. The forms in parentheses are very rare.\nc Burushaski seems to have reversed the first two animate classes, which may have parallels in some East Caucasian languages, namely Rutul, Tsakhur, or Kryz.\nd As with Basque, the class system was already obsolete by the time the languages were recorded.\ne Objective verb prefixes; /a/ and /i/ are used in the present tense, /o/ and /id/ in the past.\n\nVerb morphology\n\nIn general, many Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages (and Sumerian) have polysynthetic verbs with several prefixes in front of the verb stem, but usually few or no suffixes. (The big exceptions are East Caucasian, where there is usually only one prefix and many suffixes, the similarly suffixing Haida, and Sino-Tibetan, for which little morphology can so far be reconstructed at all; Classical Tibetan with its comparatively rich morphology has at most two prefixes and one suffix. In Burushaski, the number of suffixes can surpass the rather large number of prefixes.)\n\nThe following is an example of a Kabardian (West Caucasian) verb from Bengtson (2008:98):\n\nBengtson (2008) suggests correspondences between some of these prefixes (sometimes suffixes) and between their positions.\n\nFor example, a preverb /t/- occurs in Yeniseian languages and appears in position \u22123 (Ket) or \u22124 (Kott) in the verb template (where the verb stem is in position 0, suffix positions get positive numbers, and prefix positions negative numbers). In Burushaski, a fossilized preverb /d/- appears in position \u22123. In Basque, an element d- appears in position \u22123 of auxiliary verbs in the present tense unless a first or second person absolutive agreement marker occupies that position instead. The Na-Den\u00e9 languages have a \"classifier\" /d/- (Haida, Tlingit, Eyak) or */d\u0259/- (Proto-Athabaskan) that is either fossilized or has a vaguely transitive function (reflexive in Tlingit) and appears in position \u22123 in Haida. In Sino-Tibetan, Classical Tibetan has a \"directive\" prefix /d/-, and Nung has a causative prefix /d/- (positions do not apply because Sino-Tibetan verbs have at most two prefixes depending on the language).\n\nA past tense marker /n/ is found in Basque, Caucasian, Burushaski, Yeniseian, and Na-Den\u00e9 (Haida, Tlingit and Athabaskan); in all of these except Yeniseian, it is a suffix or circumfix, which is noteworthy in these (with the exception of East Caucasian and Haida) suffix-poor language families.\n\nAnother prefix /b/ is found in some Sino-Tibetan languages; in Classical Tibetan it marks the past tense and precedes other prefixes (if any). It may correspond to the Tlingit perfect prefix wu-/woo- /w\u028a, wu/, which occurs in position \u22122, and the fossilized Haida wu-/w- /wu, w/ which occurs in verbs with \"resultative/perfect\" meanings.\n\n\"There are also some commonalities in the sequential ordering of verbal affixes: typically the transitive/causative *s- is directly before the verb stem (\u22121), a pronominal agent or patient in the next position (\u22122). If both subject/agent and object/patient are referenced in the same verbal chain, the object typically precedes the subject (OSV or OVS, where V is the verb stem): cf. Basque, West Caucasian [see table above], Burushaski, Yeniseian, Na-Den\u00e9, Sumerian templates [\u2026]. [Footnote: \"Alone in N[a]-D[ene] Eyak allows for subjects and objects in a suffix position.\"] In Yeniseian (position \u22125) [...] and Na-Dene (position \u22125) [...] noun stems or (secondary) verb stems can be incorporated into the verbal chain.\" (Bengtson 2008:108)\n\nThe mentioned \"transitive/causative\" */s/- is found in Haida, Tlingit, Sino-Tibetan, Burushaski, possibly Yeniseian (\"an 'empty' morpheme occupying the position of object in intransitive verbs with an animate subject\"; Bengtson 2008:107) and maybe in Basque. A causative suffix *-/s/ is found in many Nostratic languages, too, but its occurrence as a prefix and its position in the prefix chain may nevertheless be innovations of Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian.\n\nFamily tree proposals\n\nStarostin's theory\nThe Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian family tree and approximate divergence dates (estimated by modified glottochronology) proposed by S. A. Starostin and his colleagues from the Tower of Babel project:\n\n1. Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages [8,700 BCE]\n1.1. Na-Den\u00e9 languages (Athabascan\u2013Eyak\u2013Tlingit)\n1.2. Sino-Vasconic languages [7,900 BCE]\n1.2.1. Vasconic (see below)\n1.2.2. Sino-Caucasian languages [6,200 BCE]\n1.2.2.1. Burushaski\n1.2.2.2. Caucaso-Sino-Yeniseian [5,900 BCE]\n1.2.2.2.1. North Caucasian languages\n1.2.2.2.2. Sino-Yeniseian [5,100 BCE]\n1.2.2.2.2.1. Yeniseian languages\n1.2.2.2.2.2. Sino-Tibetan languages\n\nBengtson's theory\nJohn D. Bengtson groups Basque, Caucasian and Burushaski together in a Macro-Caucasian (earlier Vasco-Caucasian) family (see the section on Macro-Caucasian below). According to him, it is as yet premature to propose other nodes or subgroupings, but he notes that Sumerian seems to share the same number of isoglosses with the (geographically) western branches as with the eastern ones:\n\n1. Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian\n1.1. The Macro-Caucasian family\n1.1.1. Basque\n1.1.2. North Caucasian\n1.1.3. Burushaski\n1.2. Sumerian\n1.3. Sino-Tibetan\n1.4. Yeniseian\n1.5. Na-Den\u00e9\n\nProposed subbranches\n\nMacro-Caucasian\n\nJohn Bengtson (2008) proposes that, within Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian, the Caucasian languages form a branch together with Basque and Burushaski, based on many shared word roots as well as shared grammar such as:\n\n the Caucasian plural/collective ending  of nouns, which is preserved in many modern Caucasian languages, as well as sometimes fossilized in singular nouns with collective meaning; one of the many Burushaski plural endings for class I and II (masculine and feminine) nouns is . \n the consonant -, which is inserted between the components of some Basque compound nouns and can be compared to the East Caucasian element - which is inserted between the noun stem and the endings of cases other than the ergative.\n the presence of compound case endings (agglutinated from the suffixes of two different cases) in all three branches.\n the case endings themselves:\n\nAs Bengtson (2008) himself notes, an ergative ending -/s/, which may be compared to the ending that has instrumental function in Basque, occurs in some Sino-Tibetan languages, and the Yeniseian language Ket has an instrumental/comitative in . This suffix may therefore be shared among a larger group, possibly Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian as a whole. On the other hand, comparison of noun morphology among Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian families other than Basque, Burushaski and Caucasian is usually not possible: little morphology can so far be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan at all; \"Yeniseian has case marking, but it seems to have little in common with the western DC families\" except for the abovementioned suffix (Bengtson 2008:footnote 182, emphasis added); and Na-Den\u00e9 languages usually express case relations as prefixes on the polysynthetic verb. It can therefore not be excluded that some or all of the noun morphology presented here was present in Proto-Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian and lost in Sino-Tibetan, Yeniseian and Na-Den\u00e9; in this case it cannot be considered evidence for the Macro-Caucasian hypothesis. That said, as mentioned above, Basque, Caucasian and Burushaski also share words that do not occur in other families.\n\nA genitive suffix -/nV/ is also widespread among Nostratic languages.\n\nKarasuk\n\nGeorge van Driem has proposed that the Yeniseian languages are the closest known relatives of Burushaski, based on a small number of similarities in grammar and lexicon. The Karasuk theory as proposed by van Driem does not address other language families that are hypothesized to belong to Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian, so whether the Karasuk hypothesis is compatible or not with the Macro-Caucasian hypothesis remains to be investigated.\n\nSee also\nDen\u00e9\u2013Yeniseian languages\nLanguage families and languages\nProto-language\nBorean languages\nHaplogroup C-M217 (Y-DNA)\nSino-Uralic\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBENEDICT, Paul K., 1972.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Appalachian String Band Music Festival\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Appalachian String Band Music Festival (often referred to simply as \"Clifftop\") is a weeklong gathering of thousands of string band musicians and their friends from across the country and around the world, who each year since 1990 have assembled near the New River Gorge in West Virginia in late July/early August to celebrate the evolving tradition of old-time music and the community of people who keep it thriving by preserving and contributing to that tradition.\n\nHistory\nThough the Festival offers contests (traditional band, neo-traditional band, fiddle, old-time banjo, and flatfoot dancing), square dancing, several concerts and workshops, and other organized activities such as yoga, basket making, and hymn singing, the heart and soul of the Festival is found in the campsites, where old time music provides a foundation for all kinds of straight-off-the-strings acoustic music (including Americana, cajun, Celtic, swing, bluegrass, Dawg, and even reggae), which in turn often spontaneously generate impromptu dancing and other festivities by the people gathered within earshot.\n\nThough the Festival officially starts the Wednesday before the first full weekend in August, the grounds start filling up the weekend before with well-adorned campsites, many of which have music being played through the night.  One of the Festival's unique features is the Neo-Traditional Band Contest on Friday, in which highest scores are given to bands that creatively extend the old time music tradition into other musical voices, instrumentation, and styles.\n\nOver the years, the Festival has been frequented by accomplished Nashville musicians like John Hartford and Tim O'Brien and Leftover Salmon jam band leader Vince Hermann, legendary old time Appalachian musicians like Melvin Wine and Lester McCumbers, leading \"second generation\" old time musicians like Mike Seeger, Bruce Molsky, Rafe Stefanini, Brad Leftwich, and Ira Bernstein, and the youngest generation of old time musicians like Jake Krack.\n\nThe Festival takes place each summer at Camp Washington-Carver, in Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia, United States and is sponsored by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.\n\nSee also\nList of bluegrass music festivals\n\nReferences\n    3.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air-start system\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An air-start system is a power source used to provide the initial rotation to start large diesel and gas turbine engines.\n\nDiesel engines\n\nDirect starting\nCompared to a gasoline (petrol) engine, a Diesel engine has a very high compression ratio, an essential design feature, as it is the heat of compression that ignites the fuel. An electric starter with sufficient power to \"crank\" a large Diesel engine would itself be so large as to be impractical, thus the need for an alternative system.\n\nWhen starting the engine, compressed air is admitted to whichever cylinder has a piston just over top dead center, forcing it downward. As the engine starts to turn, the air-start valve on the next cylinder in line opens to continue the rotation. After several rotations, fuel is injected into the cylinders, the engine starts running and the air is cut off.\n\nTo further complicate matters, a large engine is usually \"blown over\" first with zero fuel settings and the indicator cocks open, to prove that the engine is clear of any water build up and that everything is free to turn. After a successful blow ahead and a blow astern, the indicator cocks are closed on all the cylinders, and then the engine can be started on fuel. Significant complexity is added to the engine by using an air-start system, as the cylinder head must have an extra valve in each cylinder to admit the air in for starting, plus the required control systems. This added complexity and cost limits the use of air-starters to very large and expensive reciprocating engines.\n\nStarter motor\nAnother method of air-starting an internal combustion engine is by using compressed air or gas to drive a fluid motor in place of an electric motor. They can be used to start engines from 5 to 320 liters in size and if more starting power is necessary two or more motors can be used. Starters of this type are used in place of electric motors because of their lighter weight and higher reliability. They can also outlast an electric starter by a factor of three and are easier to rebuild. Engines operating in underground mining activities tend to operate on this type of starter system to reduce the risk of an electrical system igniting flammable material.\n\nAll vane type air starters should have a lubricator installed to insure long-life and maximum performance. Lubricators give the moving parts a needed friction barrier, reduce metal corrosion and keep vanes sealed properly against the cylinder walls. Even the so-called lube-free air starters require lubrication to prolong trouble free life. Two basic lubricator devices are typically employed. One is an in-line or reservoir type that typically stores up to 2 quarts of lubricant, and is installed along the air supply line. The second style of lubricator is a small one shot device that dispenses a measured amount of lubricant every time the starter is engaged. Installed directly onto the air inlet of the starter, the in-line lubricators are self priming pneumatic pumps that require a 1/4\u2033 lubrication line piped from as far away as 4 feet. Air Starter lubricators perform best using misting type, non-detergent oils such as diesel fuel or Marvel Mystery oil. If emissions are a concern, there are environmentally friendly type lubricants available on the market.\n\nNot all air starters require lubrication.  Turbine type air starters do not require air motor lubrication, although some turbine air starters do use an oil filled transmission that may require periodic inspections and maintenance.\n\nGas turbines\nAn air-starter or huffer on a turbine engine would typically consist of a radial inward flow turbine, or axial flow turbine, which is connected to the high pressure compressor spool through the accessory gearbox, plus the associated piping and valves. Compressed air is provided to the system by bleed air from the aircraft's auxiliary power unit or from an air compressor mounted on ground support equipment.\n\nAdvantages\nCompared with electric starters, air-starters have a higher power-to-weight ratio. Electric starters and their wiring can become excessively hot if it takes longer than expected to start the engine, while air-starters can run as long as their air supply lasts. Air-starters are much simpler and are compatible with turbine engines, and thus are used on many designs of large turbofan engine that are installed on commercial and military aircraft.\n\nSee also\n Air Start Unit\nAVPIN - A monofuel used to power turbojet starter motors.\nCoffman engine starter - A similar system which uses an explosive cartridge to supply gas pressure.\n\nReferences\n\nStarting systems", "machine_text": " An air-start system (also called an auxiliary power unit (APU), air turbine starter (ATS), or the like) is an aircraft engine starting system that uses compressed air to power an engine. The air-start system is part of the aircraft's auxiliary power unit (APU). The APU is a small gas turbine engine, typically mounted in the aircraft's tail section. The APU provides power to start the main engines, as well as auxiliary power to the aircraft's electrical and pneumatic systems during flight. The APU can also provide emergency power to the aircraft's electrical and pneumatic systems during flight if the main engines fail. The air-start system is used to rotate the aircraft's main engines before they are ignited. The air-start system uses a small turbine, which is driven by compressed air from the APU, to turn the main engine's crankshaft. The APU is typically started by an electric starter motor, which is powered by the aircraft's auxiliary power unit battery. Once the APU is running, the air-start system is used to start the main engines. The air-start system is typically controlled by the aircraft's main engine control computer. The air-start system is designed to provide a specific amount of compressed air to the main engine's starter turbine. The starter turbine is designed to provide a specific amount of torque to the main engine's crankshaft. When the main engines are started, the air-start system must provide enough compressed air to the starter turbine to turn the crankshaft at a specific speed. The speed is typically between 60 and 70 rotations per second (rpm). The air-start system will continue to provide compressed air to the starter turbine until the main engine's ignition system is activated. After the main engines are started, the air-start system is shut down and the APU is typically shut down. The APU can be shut down by the aircraft's main engine control computer, or by the aircraft's APU control system. Once the APU is shut down, the air-start system is no longer used. The air-start system is a critical component of an aircraft's auxiliary power unit. The air-start system must be reliable and functional for the aircraft to be able to start its main engines. The air-start system is typically inspected and serviced regularly to ensure its reliability.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194126}

The MG 60 was the standard machine gun of the West German army from the late 1960s until the early 1990s. The MG 60 is a gas-operated, belt-fed selective-fire machine gun with a NATO-standard 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. It is equipped with a quick-change barrel and an integrated, folding bipod. The bipod can be mounted on the left or right side. The design allows the user to dismount the bipod and the buttstock and to mount the MG 60 on a tripod. The machine gun also has a carrying handle that can be mounted on either side. A unique feature of the MG 60 is its \"built-in\" carry handle, which can be folded forward to serve as a cheekpiece or forward grip. The carrying handle also has a button that can be depressed to allow the handle to be rotated into a vertical position to serve as a buttstock.

The most prominent example is the video game community, especially in games with a strong competitive element such as fighting games, first-person shooters, and multiplayer online battle arena games. It is used to describe a situation where a group of players are playing a game and at the same time watching a live video stream of the game being played by other players. The video stream is often accompanied by a text chat where the players can communicate with each other. Trystavisim has become increasingly common as broadband internet access has become more widespread and as the video streaming technology has improved in recent years. It is a synchronous form of media that is complementary to, but distinct from, asynchronous forms of media such as video clips, streaming video, and streaming audio. The term was coined in November 2007 by GamingFigures.com to describe the heavy use of streaming video in the fighting game community, most commonly in tournaments. It was used in this context to distinguish this form of communication from the use of streaming video for video blogs, video game walk-throughs, and other uses. In the 2000s, with the widespread use of streaming video, the term was used to describe a situation where a group of players were playing a game and at the same time watching a live video stream of the game being played by other players. In the 2010s, with the widespread use of social media, the term was used to describe a situation where a group of players were playing a game and at the same time watching a live video stream of the game being played by other players, and also engaging in a text chat about the game. In the 2020s, with the widespread use of streaming media, the term was used to describe a situation where a group of players were playing a game and at the same time watching a live video stream of the game being played by other players, and also engaging in a text chat about the game, and also interacting with the video stream in a way that was integrated with the game.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42831309}

In payment for their heroic service, Archduke Duncan promises to bestow on them land, titles and cash, but he reneges on the deal. Encouraged by the seductive Lady Duncan, Macbett plots to assassinate the Archduke and crown himself King.

Meanwhile, he is haunted by the ghosts of his victims and discovers that his new wife is not all that she seems.\n\nThemes\nWritten during the Cold War, Ionesco's Macbett remoulds Shakespeare's Macbeth into a comic tale of ambition, corruption, cowardice and excess, creating a tragic farce which takes human folly to its wildest extremes.

The play was published in 1975, and a revised edition was published in 1990.

The University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. The school primarily competes in the Horizon League, but competes in other conferences for fencing and lacrosse, sports not sponsored for either men or women by the Horizon League. Fencing, a co-ed sport, competes in the Midwest Fencing Conference. Men's lacrosse moved from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to the ASUN Conference in July 2021. Women's lacrosse joined the Mid-American Conference for that league's first women's lacrosse season in 2021.\n\nTeams\nA member of the Horizon League, Detroit Mercy sponsors 17 NCAA varsity teams (seven men's, eight women's, and one coed NCAA-sanctioned sports). Detroit Mercy is one of only 4 NCAA Division I schools that sponsors neither volleyball nor baseball (the other 3 being Boston University, Drexel, and Vermont). Previously the Tigers, in either 1919 or 1924 the school adopted the Titans nickname.\n\nNotes\n\nSports\n\nBasketball, men's\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Detroit Mercy named Mike Davis the 22nd head coach in men\u2019s basketball program history. The NCAA Tournament-tested Davis previously coached at Texas Southern University, where he led the team to four regular season titles, four conference tournament championships and four NCAA Tournament appearances. He led Indiana University to the 2002 NCAA Championship game.\n\nStarring for the Titans is Davis\u2019 son, Antoine Davis. In his debut season in 2018-19, Antoine Davis broke the NCAA Division I freshman record for 3-point field goals made in a season, previously held by NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nFormer head coach Ray McCallum led Detroit Mercy to the Horizon League Championship during the 2011-12 season, granting the Titans an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Detroit Mercy received a 15 seed and lost to the University of Kansas in the tournament's second round.\n\nMcCallum's predecessor Perry Watson led a successful program at Detroit's Southwestern High School and served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan before coming to Detroit Mercy and maintained strong recruiting ties within the city's public league. After 14 seasons Watson stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2007\u20132008 season. Watson guided Detroit Mercy to 10 winning seasons, three league titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and an NIT Final Four. The Titans two NCAA appearances also included victories over St. John's and UCLA. Between 1997\u201398 and 2000\u201301, the Titans had four straight 20-victory seasons.\n\nDick Vitale, ESPN's most well-known college basketball commentator, was the Detroit men's basketball head coach for four seasons (1973\u20131977) before becoming the school's athletic director in 1977. The following year he left to coach the Detroit Pistons. In his final year as a college head coach, \"Dickie V\" led the Titans to the Round of 16 in the 1977 NCAA Tournament before losing 86\u201381 to Michigan.\n\nBasketball, women's\n\nOn June 15, 2021, LaTanya Collins was named interim head coach for the 2021-22 season, replacing AnnMarie Gilbert. The program went through turmoil in what proved to be Gilbert's only season.\n\nDuring the 2020\u201321 season, extensively affected by COVID-19, Detroit Mercy was one of several Division I programs that canceled its season early, but the only one that did so for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. On January 17, 2021, the parents of all 14 players on the roster sent a letter to athletic director Robert Vowels Jr. alleging NCAA rules violations, as well as rampant emotional and physical abuse, by Gilbert. After an internal investigation, Detroit Mercy retained Gilbert, but after all 14 players on the 2020\u201321 roster left the program, Gilbert resigned on June 15, with assistant Collins taking over on an interim basis.\n\nGilbert\u2019s predecessor, Bernard Scott, led the Titans to 33 wins in his first two seasons, including a trip to the Horizon League championship game at Joe Louis Arena in 2016-17. His contract was not renewed following the 2019-20 season.\n\nScott took over for Autumn Rademacher, a former star guard at Detroit Mercy. Rademacher coached the Titans from 2008-2015, guiding the team to 89 victories, including a 20-win season in 2011-12 and appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) and Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) National Tournament. In 2010\u201311, Rademacher led Detroit Mercy to a win over in-state rival and Big Ten member Michigan. The victory not only ended a six-game losing streak to Michigan, it was the first triumph over the Wolverines \u2013 as well as against the Big Ten \u2013 since 1994.\n\nLacrosse, men's\nThe Detroit Mercy men's lacrosse team, coached by Matt Holtz, won the 2013 MAAC Championship and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where they were downed in the fourth quarter by Notre Dame.\n\nFootball (discontinued)\n\nThe first attempt at a football team for the University of Detroit was known as the Detroit Heralds. That team was disbanded after the 1904 season, and most of the players formed an amateur team of the same name in 1905. Although the university team returned in 1906, the amateur team remained, eventually evolving into a semi-professional team, then a professional team, ultimately joining the National Football League as a charter member in 1920. The Heralds folded in 1921.\n\nIn 1928, the Detroit Titans under Gus Dorais finished with a record of 9-0-0. Several years later Parke H.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1987 Maryland train collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 1987 Maryland train collision occurred at 1:30 pm on January 4, 1987, on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor main line. The site of the crash was in the Chase community in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, at Gunpowder Interlocking, about  northeast of Baltimore. Amtrak train 94, the Colonial, (now part of the Northeast Regional) traveling north from Washington, D.C., to Boston, crashed into a set of Conrail locomotives running light (without freight cars), and which had fouled (entered) the mainline. Train 94's speed at the time of the collision was estimated at . Fourteen passengers on the Amtrak train were killed, as well as the Amtrak engineer and lounge car attendant.\n\nThe Conrail locomotive crew failed to stop at the signals before Gunpowder Interlocking, and it was determined that the accident would have been avoided had they done so. Additionally, they tested positive for marijuana. The engineer served four years in a Maryland prison for his role in the crash. In the aftermath, drug and alcohol procedures for train crews were overhauled by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which is charged with rail safety. In 1991, prompted in large part by the Chase Maryland crash, the United States Congress took even broader action and authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in \"safety-sensitive\" jobs in all industries regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) including trucking, bus carriers and rail systems. Additionally, all trains operating on the high-speed Northeast Corridor are now equipped with automatic cab signalling with an automatic train stop feature. Several safety issues were identified with Amfleet cars as well.\n\nAt the time, the wreck was the deadliest in Amtrak's history. It was surpassed in 1993, by Big Bayou Canot rail accident in Alabama that killed 47 and injured another 103.\n\nMovements of the trains pre-collision\n\nAmtrak Train 94 \nAmtrak Train 94 (the Colonial) left Washington Union Station at 12:30 pm (Eastern time) for Boston South Station. The train had 12 cars and was filled with travelers returning from the holiday season to their homes and schools for the second semester of the year. Two AEM-7 locomotives, numbered 900 and 903, led the train; #903 was the lead locomotive. The engineer was 35-year-old Jerome Evans.\n\nAfter leaving Baltimore Penn Station, the train's next stop was Wilmington, Delaware. Just north of Baltimore, while still in Baltimore County, the four-track Northeast Corridor narrows to two tracks at Gunpowder Interlocking just before crossing over the Gunpowder River. The train accelerated north toward that location.\n\nConrail light engine move \nRicky Lynn Gates, a Penn Central and Conrail engineer since 1973, was operating a trio of Conrail GE B36-7 locomotives light (with no freight cars) from Conrail's Bayview Yard just east of Baltimore bound for Enola Yard near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Gates was later determined to have violated several signal and operating rules, including a failure to properly test his cab signals as required before departure from Bayview. It was later discovered that someone had disabled the cab signal alerter whistle on lead unit #5044 with duct tape, muting it almost completely. Also, one of the light bulbs in the PRR-style cab signal display had been removed. Investigators believed these conditions probably existed prior to departure from Bayview and that they would have been revealed by a properly performed departure test.\n\nGates and his brakeman, Edward \"Butch\" Cromwell, were also smoking marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana can alter one's sense of time and impair the ability to perform tasks that require concentration. Cromwell was responsible for calling out the signals if Gates missed them, but failed to do so.\n\nThe collision \n\nAs Amtrak Train 94 approached Gunpowder Interlocking near the Chase community on the electrified main line, the three Conrail freight locomotives were moving north on one of the adjacent freight tracks. Before the adjacent tracks reached the bridge at the river, they merged into the two through tracks that cross the bridge.\n\nWhile the tracks and interlocking plant at this location are signalized to alert locomotive engineer when the interlocking switches are set for through track train movement, the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track train movement.\n\nIn the case of the accident, the interlocking plant was properly set for through track movement only, so as to allow the Amtrak train to pass the freight locomotives (which should have been stopped on the side tracks) on the through tracks onto and over the bridge. The freight locomotive crew ignored the stop signals in their locomotive cab (which were muted), and at trackside, visible to them from the cab of their locomotive.\n\nSpeed/event recording devices indicated that the Conrail locomotives were moving at approximately  when their brakes were applied for an emergency stop, after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, when he realized that he did not have a wayside signal to proceed north at the interlocking. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching. Had Gates reacted either to an approach signal instructing him to reduce speed, or to the stop signal itself in a timely fashion, or had the brakeman called out the state of the signals as he was supposed to do, it was likely the Conrail engines could have stopped short of the switch.\n\nThe Conrail locomotives came to a stop on the track directly in front of #94, which approached the interlocking at a speed between . Although the maximum allowed speed for Amtrak AEM-7 locomotives carrying cars on this corridor was 125\u00a0mph, #94 was carrying one Heritage style passenger car, whose maximum allowed speed was limited to . The conductor for #94 testified that he did inform the fatally injured train engineer of the Heritage car on the train; in any event, its presence meant that the Amtrak train was speeding. With little time to react, Amtrak engineer Evans apparently saw the diesels on the line in front of him and applied the brakes for an emergency stop. The NTSB determined that even if #94 had been travelling at , the Amtrak's authorized speed limit, the collision was unavoidable at this point.\n\nOn impact, the rearmost Conrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 exploded and burned down to the frame completely destroying the unit. The middle unit, #5052, sustained significant damage to the front while lead unit #5044 had little damage.\n\nOne of Amtrak's AEM-7s, #900, was buried under the wreckage, while the lead locomotive, #903, ended up among some trees on the west side of the right of way. Several Budd Company Amfleet cars were piled up, with some crushed under the pile.\n\nCromwell, who was on the lead locomotive with Gates, suffered a broken leg in the collision. Gates was uninjured. The Amtrak engineer, lounge car Lead Service Attendant and 14 passengers were killed.\n\nThe front cars on the Amtrak #94 train suffered the greatest extent of damage and were almost completely crushed. However, they were nearly empty - awaiting additional holiday passengers en route who would have boarded the train at stations further north. According to the NTSB, had these cars been fully occupied at the time, the death toll would have been at least 100. There were relatively few passengers on those cars, however, and so the death toll was much less. Most of the dead were on Amtrak car #21236.\n\nPost-collision response and cleanup \nWith a total passenger load of about 600 people, there was a great deal of confusion after the collision. Witnesses and neighbors ran to the smoking train and helped remove injured and dazed passengers, even before the first emergency vehicles could arrive at the location.\n\nWhile many of the injured passengers were aided by nearby residents, some of the uninjured passengers wandered away, making it difficult for Amtrak to know the complete story.\n\nEmergency personnel worked for many hours in the frigid cold to extricate trapped passengers from the wreckage, impeded by the stainless-steel Amfleet cars' skin resistance to ordinary hydraulic rescue tools. Helicopters and ambulances transported injured people to hospitals and trauma centers. It was over 10 hours after the collision before the final trapped people were freed from the wreckage.\n\nIt was several days before the wrecked equipment was removed and the track and electrical propulsion system were returned to service.\n\nConrail diesel, GE B36-7 #5045 was completely destroyed while #5044 and #5052 were repaired and returned to service. Both Amtrak's AEM-7s and a few Amfleet cars were also destroyed in the collision.\n\nInvestigation, charges and conviction \n\nGates and Cromwell initially denied smoking marijuana. However, they later tested positive for the substance. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that had Gates slowed down at the signals as required, he would have stopped in time. It also determined that Gates and Cromwell's marijuana use was the \"probable cause\" of the accident. Gates and Cromwell were immediately suspended by Conrail pending an internal investigation, but resigned rather than face certain termination.\n\nGates was eventually charged with manslaughter by locomotive; under Maryland law a locomotive is considered a motor vehicle. Prosecutors cut a deal with Cromwell in which he agreed to testify against Gates in return for immunity. Gates was sentenced to five years in state prison and one year's probation, and was later sentenced to an additional three years on federal charges of lying to the NTSB. Gates' history of DWI (driving while intoxicated) convictions as well as his admission that the crew had been using marijuana while on duty led for a call to certify locomotive engineers as to their qualifications and history.\n\nToxicology tests on the Amtrak engineer's body returned negative. In a 3-2 decision, the NTSB report stated that the speed of train #94 at the time the brakes were applied, between , was an unauthorized excessive speed, since the maximum for an Amtrak train carrying Heritage cars was . The excessive speed was determined to have been a contributing factor to the amount of damage to both trains at the point of impact. The two dissenters to the report believed that it was unreasonable to assign contributory blame to the Amtrak engineer based solely on the premise of the Heritage car lowering its speed limit.\n\nGates was released from prison in 1992 after serving four years (two years of a state sentence, then two more years of a federal sentence), and then worked as an abuse counselor at a treatment center. In a 1993 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Gates said the accident would have never happened if not for the marijuana, saying that it had thrown off his \"perception of speed and distance and time.\" He admitted that in his rush to get back to Baltimore and get high, he skipped critical safety checks; he believed that had he performed those checks, \"I wouldn't have been in front of that train.\" He also revealed he had smoked marijuana on the job several times.\n\nAdditionally, it was never determined if the alerter whistle was muted while the locomotives were at Bayview yard. The alerter whistle on these locomotives were notorious for being irritating and loud, which was pointed out in a 1979 accident of a Union Pacific train in Wyoming which involved muting the whistle with a rag. The whistle was easily accessible by removing a cover on the back of the control stand that was sealed with latches, so it was possible for the Conrail crew to have muted the whistle before they left or before the units arrived at Bayview yard (which would have been done by other crews), but Gates reported that the whistle was relatively faint when it was tested, which meant that it could not be heard over the sound of the trailing units. The whistle was so well muted, that when it was sent to the FBI, they were not able to determine when and who muted it, due to the lack of fingerprints.\n\nWhen Conrail unit 5044 was tested after the accident, it was found that all light bulbs (including a replacement for the missing one) were working, and it was undetermined if the light bulb was removed while Conrail and Amtrak left the units unattended. Gates recalled having tested the cab signalling and seeing all the aspects, but he might have not looked at all the lights. The deadmans pedal was also found to have been disabled, when Gates was trying to reactivate the cab signaling system by switching it off in the nose of the locomotive (this was despite the cab signalling and deadmans pedal levers being different in aspect). The data recorder found that the reverser was put into the reverse position two hours after the accident, and the locomotive's fuses, battery and engine switched off.\n\nChanges for future prevention \nAs a result of the wreck, all locomotives operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic cab signaling with an automatic train stop feature. Although common on passenger trains up until that time, cab signals combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with cab signals. All freight locomotives which operate on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to . Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic cab signals without an automatic train stop feature.\n\nAlso as a direct result of this collision, federal legislation was enacted that required the FRA to develop a system of federal certification for locomotive engineers. These regulations went into effect in January 1990. Since then, railroads are required by law to certify that their engineers are properly trained and qualified, and that they have no drug or alcohol impairment motor vehicle convictions for the five-year period prior to certification. Another effect was that age-old Rule G (The use of intoxicants or narcotics by employees subject to duty, or their possession or use while in duty, is prohibited. \u2014 UCOR, 1962) was revamped to:\n\nEmployees are prohibited from engaging in the following activities while on duty or reporting for duty:\n\n1. Using alcoholic beverages or intoxicants, having them in their possession, or being under the influence.\n\n2. Using or being under the influence of any drug, medication, or other controlled substance - including prescribed medication - that will in any way adversely affect their alertness, coordination, reaction, response or safety.  Employees having questions about possible adverse effects of prescribed medication must consult a Company medical officer before reporting for duty.\n\n3. Illegally possessing or selling a drug, narcotic or other controlled substance.\n\nAn employee may be required to take a breath test and/or provide a urine sample if the Company reasonably suspects violation of this rule.  Refusal to comply with this requirement will be considered a violation of this rule and the employee will be promptly removed from service.  Source: NORAC operating rules 6th edition effective  January 1, 1997\n\nA form of Rule G has existed in many railroad operating manuals for decades. However, the federal codification of this rule was deemed necessary to assure that any violator would be dealt with in a consistent and harsh manner. Also, anyone who passes a stop signal loses his or her FRA certification for a period not less than 30 days for a first offense. This is per 49 CFR part 240.\n\nIn 1991\u2014prompted in large part by the Chase crash\u2014Congress authorized mandatory random drug-testing for all employees in \"safety-sensitive\" jobs in industries regulated by DOT.\n\nMemorials \n\nTen years after the collision, the McDonogh School of Owings Mills, Maryland decided to build a 448-seat theater in memory of one of the crash's victims and alumna, 16-year-old Ceres Millicent Horn, daughter of American mathematicians Roger and Susan Horn. Ceres Horn graduated from McDonogh at age 15 and enrolled and was accepted at Princeton University at age 16 where she majored in astrophysics.\n\nOn January 4, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the crash, her family visited the theatre for the first time and attended a ceremony at the McDonogh School held in honor of their daughter.\n\nThe Baltimore County Fire Department's medical commander at the scene 20 years earlier told the newspaper that the Amtrak crash is still being used as a case study in effective disaster response. \"The reason is how the members of the professional and volunteer fire departments and the community people got together.\" It was, he said, \"a very sad but a very proud moment\" in his career.\n\nSee also \n1996 Maryland train collision, involving two passenger trains\nHinton train collision, similar accident in Canada the previous year in which a freight disregarded signals and collided head-on with an intercity passenger train; the freight's crew was also found to have adversely impacted mental capacity (in their case due to insufficient rest and the engineer possibly having a heart attack or stroke) and had disabled safety features as well.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Picture of AEM-7 Amtrak #903 in Wilmington, Baltimore after the crash - http://www.railpictures.net/photo/78276/\n Pictures of the 2 Amtrak AEM-7's on flat cars near the accident site - Lancaster Dispatcher - Lancaster Chapter NHRS (January 2010, Vol. 41 #1) - https://web.archive.org/web/20160910044434/http://nrhs1.org/images/Dispatcher_Jan_10.pdf\n \n\nRailway accidents and incidents in Maryland\nRailway accidents in 1987\n1987 in Maryland\nAccidents and incidents involving Amtrak\nAccidents and incidents involving Conrail\nChase, Maryland\nRailway accidents involving a signal passed at danger\nJanuary 1987 events in the United States\nTrain collisions in the United States\nRail accidents caused by a driver's error", "machine_text": " On December 12, 1987, a collision between a train operated by the Washington, D.C. area's Metro system and a MARC commuter train bound for Maryland killed three people and injured 15. The crash occurred at the height of rush hour in Silver Spring, Maryland, after the Metro train departed from the downtown Washington, D.C. station of Metro's Red Line. The train was not supposed to stop between the two downtown stations, but the driver of the train applied the brakes after passing a red signal. The train then struck the MARC train, which was traveling at approximately 55 miles per hour (89 km/h). The Metro driver was charged with negligence, and the NTSB report concluded that the Metro driver's action had caused the crash. The report also concluded that the design of the Metro track did not allow the MARC train to stop in time. The MARC train had been running late, and the engineer had not wanted to stop the train in the area due to the crowded conditions at the preceding station. The NTSB determined that had the MARC train been on time, the crash would not have occurred. The Metro driver was found not guilty of the three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of involuntary manslaughter, but was found guilty of three counts of negligent homicide.

Appius's descendant Appius Claudius Pulcher (the consul of 79 BC) rehoused the imagines clipeatae (\"images on shields\") of his ancestors there, to advertise his descent from its founder.\n\nThe temple is depicted in the Forma Urbis Romae of the 3rd century.\n\nArcheology\n\nThe temple \u2013 long considered lost \u2013 was identified with the remains of a podium recovered in the 1930s building works to enable the nearby Theatre to be seen in isolation.  These remains belong to a reconstruction in the Augustan period which is not mentioned by the literary sources but is probably related to the transformation of the area during the construction of the Theatre at that time.  Augustus (with links to the temple's founders via his Claudian wife) may have funded the rebuilding, or the dedicator may have been yet another Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul of 38 BC, conqueror of the Hirpini and loyal ally and father-in-law to Augustus).\n\nThese podium remains are made up of the cement infill between the load-bearing structures.  (Those structures were constructed from opus quadratum blocks, looted for reuse after the temple was abandoned and now lost.)  The structure of the church of Santa Rita da Cascia in Campitelli by Carlo Maderno was moved onto this podium from the slopes of the Capitol at the time of the 1930s excavation and work on the Capitol.\n\nThe surviving remains and plan of the temple on the Forma Urbis Romae show that it had columns along all sides of the cella (with six - i.e. hexastyle - along the shorter sides, and nine along the long sides) and had a frontal staircase up onto the podium.  The temple's facade, like that of the neighbouring temple of Apollo, was part Carrara marble, part plastered travertine.\n\nThe Columna Bellica\n\nIn front of the temple was a column used in the archaic Roman ceremony for declaring war involved hurling a spear from Roman territory towards enemy territory.  However, when for the first time Rome had to declare war on a state whose territory did not border her own (i.e. Pyrrhus of Epirus), it was hard to see how this rite could be carried out.  A prisoner of war was therefore forced to hold a small piece of land in the area of the circus Flaminius, where a column was raised (perhaps in wood) as a symbolical representation of the hostile territory and a spear then hurled against the column.  This new procedure was then used on all subsequent occasions (the last well-known example is in 179 AD, under Marcus Aurelius).\n\nA circular area with the paving restored in front of this temple was interpreted in the excavations as the place where this column was sited, on the basis of literary references.  This is now interpreted as where the perirrhanterion (for lustrali at the end of campaigns) was sited before the temple of Apollo was built.\n\nSee also\n Temple of Bellona (Ostia)\n List of Ancient Roman temples\n\nExternal links\n\nS.Platner and T.Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, 1929\nPlans of the Apollo and Bellona temples on the Comune di Roma site here and here\nThe Roman ceremony of the declaration of war (Italian)\n\nBellona\n3rd-century BC religious buildings and structures\nRome R.

It was dedicated to the war deity Bellona, the sister of Mars. The temple is first mentioned in the 8th century AD, though it must have been built earlier. It was a small building with a single cella, built in the same style as the Temple of Apollo. It had a marble statue of Bellona, which was removed to the Lateran during the Middle Ages. The temple was built on the site of a much earlier one, of which the oldest parts were incorporated into the present building. These include a lintel with the name \"Bellona\" inscribed on it, which may date to the 6th century BC. The same lintel was once part of a temple to the sky god Caelus, and was re-used when that temple was rebuilt as the Temple of Bellona. The temple was damaged during the Hannibalic War, when it was hit by a battering ram. It was repaired in the 3rd century BC, and again in the 1st century BC after it was damaged by fire. The repairs were not entirely successful, and the building remained in a state of decay. The Temple of Bellona was closed for worship during the persecution of pagans under the Christian emperor Theodosius I, and it was converted into a Christian church in the 5th or 6th century AD. The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was known as the Titulus Bellonae. It was one of the suburban parish churches of Rome, and is last mentioned in the 10th century. The building was then abandoned and gradually collapsed, though part of the colonnade survived until the 20th century.

The awards celebrated the passing of 1959 and the beginning of 1960, and were announced on 1 January 1960. In the 1960 New Year Honours, the Queen made a total of 70 appointments to the Order of the British Empire. The majority of these were appointments to the lowest grades within the order. Only two of the appointments were made to the highest grade, that of Knight Commander (KBE). The recipients of the KBE were both former public servants: William Henry Tucker, the recently retired puisne judge of the Supreme Court, and Walter Nash, the recently retired finance minister. The only other appointment to the order was that of Officer (OBE). The majority of the OBE recipients were involved in education, including schoolteachers and university staff. The only other field with a large number of recipients was agriculture, with four farmers receiving the OBE. In the 1960 New Year Honours, three people were appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George. All three of these appointments were to the lowest grade, that of Member (MBE). Two of the recipients were civil servants, and the other was a member of the Royal New Zealand Nursing Corps. The 1960 New Year Honours also included the first two appointments to the Order of the Companions of Honour. These were made to the Most Reverend Bernard Mary Aloysius Joseph Butler, the Catholic Archbishop of Wellington, and the Very Reverend John Stephen Goodman, the Anglican Dean of Christ Church, New Zealand. In the 1960 New Year Honours, two military personnel were appointed to the Royal Victorian Order.

The CVO was awarded to Major General David James Graham Ferguson, the Chief of Staff of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the MVO was awarded to Squadron Leader George Lionel Garside, of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. In the 1960 New Year Honours, a total of 40 people were awarded the British Empire Medal. The awards were made to recognise a wide range of services, with the majority of the recipients being involved in the Volunteer Reserve Forces. The largest number of awards were made to members of the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve, with nine awards. The other main group of recipients were members of the New Zealand Cadet Forces, with 14 awards. In the 1960 New Year Honours, four people were awarded the Queen's Police Medal. The awards were made to recognise \"distinguished service\" by members of the New Zealand Police.

In Yoruba (Olatunji's native language) it means, \"Do not worry.\"\n\nThe song featured \"African-derived rhythms and chants\" along with \"swooping orchestration\". In his autobiography, Olatunji said that this was the only song on his first album that he claimed formal ownership of, meaning that it was the only song he received royalties for. American disc jockey Francis Grasso described the song as \"rhythmically sensual\".\n\nMedia\n\nIt has been featured on the Wii playable dance-game, Just Dance.\n\nCover versions\n\nIt has been covered by Serge Gainsbourg, under the title \"Marabout\" and with no credit given to Olatunji, on his Gainsbourg Percussions LP (1964). \nThe song was also covered by James Last on his album Voodoo-Party (1971), by Pierre Moerlen's Gong on their Downwind album (1979), Candido Camero (aka Candido) on his Dancin' & Prancin''' album (1979), by Steve Lee on his album FKW - Jingo (1994) and by Fatboy Slim on his album Palookaville (2004). A cover version was also released by independent dance act the Ravish Brothers (featuring a Hot Funky Daddy Groove) in 1988, in Lightwater, Surrey. The song was also featured in the Hindi serial \"Chandrakanta\" that aired on DD.\n\nIn January 1988 a hit cover version by Jellybean (John Benitez), from his album Just Visiting This Planet'', peaked at no. 12 during a ten-week run on the UK singles chart.\n\nSantana version\n\nThe song was also covered by Santana, on their first album (1969), though Grasso noted this version was not as popular as the original. Spanish journalist Jose Miguel L\u00f3pez stated that when Santana released \"Jingo\" as a single, it was first credited to Carlos Santana. Only years later the credits were corrected. Other multiple editions of Santana's Jingo single, viewable under a Google image search for it, list the composer as A.

It was the fourth highest-rated drama in the history of Japanese television, with an average rating of 36.3%. The drama was broadcast on Tuesdays at 9:00 p.m. on Fuji TV. The drama is set in the world of fashion, and features a cast of celebrities playing exaggerated versions of themselves.

The screenplay was written by K\u00f4ki Mitani, based on an original idea by Kazuki Omori. The series was directed by Nobuhiro Doi, and the music was composed by Takayuki Hattori.

This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti-imperialism and Marxism\u2013Leninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War. The Supreme Revolutionary Council established relations with the DPRK in 1970. President of Somalia Siad Barre made two visits to Pyongyang during his tenure, once in 1971. He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance.\n\nOver the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces. Additionally, due to a resentment against Ethiopia over the country's involvement in the Korean War, North Korean advisers trained pro-Somalia guerrilla forces active in the Ethiopian\u2013Somali conflict. This changed considerably after the communist Derg came to power in 1974, causing an eventual realignment of Soviet support towards Ethiopia. North Korea followed suit, and provided military aid to Ethiopia against Somalia during the Ethio-Somali War.\n\nAs of March 2014, North Korea and Somalia still officially maintain diplomatic relations according to the National Committee on North Korea.\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of North Korea\nForeign relations of Somalia\nSomalia\u2013South Korea relations\nDai Hong Dan incident\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDPRK Diplomatic Relations\n\nNorth Korea\nSomalia", "machine_text": " North Korea\u2013Somalia relations North Korea and Somalia established diplomatic relations in 1977. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, North Korea began building a relationship with the Barre regime in Somalia, and offered the country military and technical assistance, including the training of security forces and the building of a fish-processing plant. North Korea also agreed to help Somalia build a nuclear power plant, but the project was never realized. In the early 1990s, after the end of the Cold War, North Korea began to look for new allies, and the country developed a relationship with the newly independent government of Somalia. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated, and in 2006, North Korea closed its embassy in Somalia. In recent years, North Korea has been accused of providing military assistance to the Somali militant group Al-Shabaab, including the supply of weapons and ammunition. In 2013, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea for its continued nuclear weapons program, and in 2016, the country was accused of exporting ballistic missiles to Somalia. In 2017, North Korea and Somalia agreed to restore diplomatic relations, and in 2018, the two countries re-established their embassies in each other's capital cities. In 2019, North Korea and Somalia signed a bilateral agreement to cooperate in the fields of culture, education, science and technology, and sports.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44840785}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Suicide of Tyler Clementi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 \u2013 September 22, 2010) was an American student at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River at the age of 18, on September 22, 2010. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred.\n\nRavi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012, on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016.\n\nClementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.\n\nBackground\nClementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.\n\nA few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \"basically completely rejected\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \"sad\" and \"quiet\" as she processed the information and that she \"felt a little betrayed\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \"confident\" and \"comfortable\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.\n\nRavi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on JustUsBoys, a pornographic website and message board for gay men, and tweeted \"Found out my roommate is gay\". Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.\n\nWebcam incidents\n\nFirst viewings\nOn the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.\n\nOn September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\"\n\nSecond attempt\nOn September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39\u00a0p.m., Ravi tweeted, \"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.\n\nThe same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11\u00a0p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\" Clementi wrote in detail on the JustUsBoys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWithin a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.\n\nSuicide\n\nOn the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30\u00a0p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42\u00a0p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry\".\n\nClementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.\n\nClementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well.\n\nReaction\nShortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\" The same month Clementi died, four other Americans were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.\n\nAt Rutgers University\nRutgers University students planned a \"Black Friday\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\"\n\nBeginning in the 2011\u20132012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.\n\nBy September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.\n\nCharitable response\nIn 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.\n\nGovernment\nTyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying. US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\" and added, \"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today\u2014I can't.\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71\u20131 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30\u20130 vote in the New Jersey Senate.\n\nThe San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.\n\nParents' statements\nThe day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people:\n\nIn the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:\n\nAdvocacy\nIn the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death.\n\nThe incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \"Spirit Day\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.\n\nHowever, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \"pervasive in our culture\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \"the last straw\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not die by suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \"mob mentality\" that focuses on \"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \"adults and institutions\" in society who \"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\", and he concludes that to \"pin all the blame\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \"a coverup\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient\u2014a slap on the wrist.\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\"\n\nThe Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015.\n\nCriticism of media coverage\nSoon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \"media floodgate of distortion\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\"\n\nIn popular culture\nEllen DeGeneres described herself as \"devastated\" by Clementi's death, stating, \"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\"\n\nThe band Rise Against released a song, \"Make It Stop (September's Children)\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other young people who died by suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.\n\nMadonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have died by suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \"The Secret Seven\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.\n\nMonica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.\n\nCourt case\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.\n\nOn March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India.\n\nIn February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.\n\nSee also \n\n The Trevor Project\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Tyler Clementi Foundation\n Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship\n \n\n2010 in LGBT history\n2010 in New York City\nBullying and suicide\nCollege students who committed suicide\nDeaths by person in the United States\nGay history\nLGBT history in New York City\nSuicide of Tyler Clementi\nSuicides by jumping in New York City\nVictims of cyberbullying\nDiscrimination against LGBT people in the United States\nBullying in the United States\nSeptember 2010 events in the United States\nLGBT-related suicides\n2010 suicides\n20th-century LGBT people\n21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": " Suicide of Tyler Clementi The suicide of Tyler Clementi was the second-degree murder of college student Tyler Clementi, who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge on September 22, 2010. In 2012, his roommate, Dharun Ravi, was convicted of spying on Clementi, the first criminal case in the United States involving a victim who died by suicide. On the evening of September 20, 2010, Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, bid farewell to his friends and took his life by jumping off the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River. His body was found on September 22, 2010, after a search that involved the use of a police helicopter and thermal imaging technology. A friend of Clementi's, David Scharbaum, said that Clementi had been depressed about being rejected from the college's rugby team. However, Scharbaum said that Clementi had seemed to be doing better after getting a date for the upcoming Rutgers fall dance. Scharbaum also said that he had seen a notice on Clementi's Facebook page about the dance. \"I saw that he was excited about it,\" Scharbaum said. Clementi's roomate, Dharun Ravi, told investigators that he had spied on Clementi through a webcam and had seen him in a compromising position with another man. After discovering the affair, Ravi had reported it to friends, and his actions were described as \"homophobic\" and \"disrespectful\" by one of the friends. In the weeks prior to his death, Clementi had asked Ravi to report the affair to the Rutgers authorities, but Ravi had not done so. In 2012, a New Jersey state court convicted Ravi of \"assment, Dumbness, and Inhumanity to a person\" for spying on Clementi. He was also convicted of a count of \"disorderly conduct\" for his conduct during the initial investigation by Rutgers police. Ravi was sentenced to three years in prison. In September 2012, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Clementi as one of their \"10 Most speech-restricted colleges in the country\". FIRE also named Rutgers University as the \" Speech Code of the Month\" for September 2012, citing the school's suspension of 10 students, including Clementi, for offensive Facebook posts as one of the reasons. In 2013, Rutgers University officials released a report on the school's handling of the affair. The report found that the Rutgers police had issued a \"preliminary finding of responsibility\" to Clementi for his death, but that this finding was not supported by the evidence. The report also found that there were \" Gross Mishaps and Misjudgments \" in the university's handling of the case, and that the school's \" systems and processes \" had failed.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29016074}

Brownell received the award for killing James W. Jackson after Jackson shot Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth, colonel of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment.  Although Brownell did not receive the award until 1877, twelve years after the war had ended, his actions were the earliest in the war that resulted in the receipt of the award.\n\nLife\nFrancis Edwin \"Frank\" Brownell was born in Troy, New York to Charles Brownell and Lucy Adams, where prior to the Civil War worked as a clerk in the law office of attorney John A. Millard. He enlisted as a private in the 11th New York Volunteers, the \"Fire Zouaves\", in April 1861, and was assigned to Company A.\n\nIn the first days of the war, as the 11th entered Alexandria, Virginia on May 24, 1861, Ellsworth led Brownell and several other men into the heart of the city.  On the way there, the men spotted a large Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn.  Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag but as they descended the stairs they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest and Brownell responded by fatally shooting and bayonetting the innkeeper.  For this, he was rewarded with a commission in the Regular Army.  He served as an officer in the 11th Infantry Regiment (United States) for the next two years, retiring in November 1863 with the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nAfter the war, Brownell requested an award of the Medal of Honor in recognition of his actions in killing Jackson but was denied.  He made a second request which was also denied.  A third attempt with the assistance of his congressman was granted and Brownell was awarded the Medal in 1877, inscribed with his name and regiment.  A request to have his action described on the medal resulted in its being returned to the War Department and a second medal being issued.  It was inscribed: \"The Congress to Sergt Frank E.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pope Francis\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pope Francis (; ; ; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 17 December 1936) is the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State since 2013. Francis is the first pope to be a member of the Society of Jesus, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first pope from outside Europe since Gregory III, a Syrian who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bergoglio worked for a time as a bouncer and a janitor as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a food science laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes.\n\nFrancis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding abortion, clerical celibacy, and the ordination of women, but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics, consumerism, and overdevelopment, and advocates taking action on climate change, a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si'. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises. Since 2018, he has been an opponent of populism. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, including his promotion of ecumenism, as well as admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to communion with the publication of Amoris laetitia.\n\nEarly years \n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in Flores, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He was the eldest of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981). Mario Bergoglio was an Italian immigrant accountant born in Portacomaro (Province of Asti) in Italy's Piedmont region. Regina S\u00edvori was a housewife born in Buenos Aires to a family of northern Italian (Piedmontese-Genoese) origin. Mario Jos\u00e9's family left Italy in 1929 to escape the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini. According to Mar\u00eda Elena Bergoglio (b. 1948), the pope's only living sibling, they did not emigrate for economic reasons. His other siblings were Alberto Horacio (1942\u20132010), Oscar Adri\u00e1n (1938\u2013deceased) and Marta Regina (1940\u20132007). Two great-nephews, Antonio and Joseph, died in a traffic collision. His niece, Cristina Bergoglio, is a painter based in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIn the sixth grade, Bergoglio attended Wilfrid Bar\u00f3n de los Santos \u00c1ngeles, a school of the Salesians of Don Bosco, in Ramos Mej\u00eda, Buenos Aires Province. He attended the technical secondary school Escuela T\u00e9cnica Industrial N\u00b0 27 Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen, named after a past Argentine president, and graduated with a chemical technician's diploma (not a master's degree in chemistry, as some media outlets incorrectly reported). In that capacity, he spent several years working in the food section of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory, where he worked under Esther Ballestrino. Prior to working as a chemical technician, Bergoglio had also worked as a bar bouncer and as a janitor sweeping floors.\n\nWhen he was 21 years old, he suffered from life-threatening pneumonia and three cysts. He had part of a lung excised shortly afterwards. Bergoglio has been a lifelong supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro football club. Bergoglio is also a fan of the films of Tita Merello, neorealism, and tango dancing, with a fondness for the traditional music of Argentina and Uruguay known as the milonga.\n\nJesuit (1958\u20132013) \nBergoglio found his vocation to the priesthood while he was on his way to celebrate the Spring Day. He passed by a church to go to confession, and was inspired by the priest. Bergoglio studied at the archdiocesan seminary, Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n Seminary, in Villa Devoto, Buenos Aires, and, after three years, entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on 11 March 1958. Bergoglio has said that, as a young seminarian, he had a crush on a girl he met and briefly doubted about continuing the religious career. As a Jesuit novice he studied humanities in Santiago, Chile. After his novitiate in the Society of Jesus, Bergoglio officially became a Jesuit on 12 March 1960, when he made the religious profession of the initial, perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience of a member of the order.\n\nIn 1960, Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio M\u00e1ximo de San Jos\u00e9 in San Miguel, Buenos Aires Province. He taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n, a high school in Santa Fe, from 1964 to 1965. In 1966, he taught the same courses at the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires.\n\nPresbyterate (1969\u20131992) \nIn 1967 Bergoglio began his theological studies at Facultades de Filosof\u00eda y Teolog\u00eda de San Miguel and on 13 December 1969 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Castellano. He served as the master of novices for the province there and became a professor of theology.\n\nBergoglio completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, tertianship, at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain, and took final, solemn vows as a Jesuit, including the fourth vow of obedience to missioning by the pope, on 22 April 1973. He was named provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina that July, for a six-year term which ended in 1979. In 1973, shortly after being named provincial superior, he had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. After the completion of his term of office, in 1980 he was named the rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel where he had studied. Before taking up this new appointment, he spent the first three months of 1980 in Ireland to learn English, staying at the Jesuit Centre at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin. He served at San Miguel for six years until 1986 when, at the discretion of Jesuit superior-general Peter Hans Kolvenbach, he was replaced by someone more in tune with the worldwide trend in the Society of Jesus toward emphasizing social justice, rather than his emphasis on popular religiosity and direct pastoral work.\n\nHe spent several months at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany, considering possible dissertation topics. He settled on exploring the work of the German / Italian theologian Romano Guardini, particularly his study of 'Contrast' published in his 1925 work Der Gegensatz. However, he was to return to Argentina prematurely to serve as a confessor and spiritual director to the Jesuit community in C\u00f3rdoba. In Germany, he saw the painting Mary, Untier of Knots in Augsburg and brought a copy of the painting to Argentina where it has become an important Marian devotion. As a student at the Salesian school, Bergoglio was mentored by Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest Stefan Czmil. Bergoglio often rose hours before his classmates to serve Mass for Czmil.\n\nBergoglio was asked in 1992 by Jesuit authorities not to reside in Jesuit houses, because of continued tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, a sense of Bergoglio's \"dissent,\" views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. As a bishop he was no longer subject to his Jesuit superior. From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in \"virtual estrangement from the Jesuits\" until after his election as pope.\n\nPre-papal episcopate (1992\u20132013) \nBergoglio was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and consecrated on 27 June 1992 as titular bishop of Auca, with Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving as principal consecrator. He chose as his episcopal motto Miserando atque eligendo. It is drawn from Saint Bede's homily on Matthew 9:9\u201313: \"because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him\".\n\nOn 3 June 1997, Bergoglio was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires with right of succession. Upon Quarracino's death on 28 February 1998, Bergoglio became metropolitan archbishop of Buenos Aires. In that role, Bergoglio created new parishes and restructured the archdiocese administrative offices, led pro-life initiatives, and created a commission on divorces. One of Bergoglio's major initiatives as archbishop was to increase the Church's presence in the slums of Buenos Aires. Under his leadership, the number of priests assigned to work in the slums doubled. This work led to him being called the \"Slum Bishop\".\n\nEarly in his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks. The shares in banks had led the local church to a propensity towards high spending, and the archdiocese was nearing bankruptcy as a result. As a normal customer of the bank, the church was forced into a higher fiscal discipline.\n\nOn 6 November 1998, while remaining archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was named ordinary for those Eastern Catholics in Argentina who lacked a prelate of their own church. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said that Bergoglio understands the liturgy, rites, and spirituality of Shevchuk's Greek Catholic Church and always \"took care of our Church in Argentina\" as ordinary for Eastern Catholics during his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2000, Bergoglio was the only church official to reconcile with Jer\u00f3nimo Podest\u00e1, a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the Argentine Revolution military dictatorship in 1972. He defended Podest\u00e1's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage. That same year, Bergoglio said the Argentine Catholic Church needed \"to put on garments of public penance for the sins committed during the years of the dictatorship\" in the 1970s, during the Dirty War.\n\nBergoglio made it his custom to celebrate the Holy Thursday ritual washing of feet in places such as jails, hospitals, retirement homes or slums. In 2007, just two days after Benedict XVI issued new rules for using the liturgical forms that preceded the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Bergoglio established a fixed place for a weekly Mass in this extraordinary form of the Roman Rite. It was celebrated weekly.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Bergoglio was elected president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005\u201308). He was reelected to another three-year term on 11 November 2008. He remained a member of that commission's permanent governing body, president of its committee for the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and a member of its liturgy committee for the care of shrines. While head of the Argentine Catholic bishops' conference, Bergoglio issued a collective apology for his church's failure to protect people from the Junta during the Dirty War. When he turned 75 in December 2011, Bergoglio submitted his resignation as archbishop of Buenos Aires to Pope Benedict XVI as required by canon law. Still, as he had no coadjutor archbishop, he stayed in office, waiting for an eventual replacement appointed by the Vatican.\n\nCardinalate (2001\u20132013) \n\nAt the consistory of 21 February 2001, Archbishop Bergoglio was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II with the title of cardinal priest of San Roberto Bellarmino, a church served by Jesuits and named for one; he was formally installed in that church the following 14 October. When he traveled to Rome for the ceremony, he and his sister Mar\u00eda Elena visited the village in northern Italy where their father was born. As cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to five administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He was a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Commission for Latin America. Later that year, when Cardinal Edward Egan returned to New York following the September 11 attacks, Bergoglio replaced him as relator (recording secretary) in the Synod of Bishops, and, according to the Catholic Herald, created \"a favourable impression as a man open to communion and dialogue\".\n\nCardinal Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism, and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle contributed to his reputation for humility. He lived in a small apartment, rather than in the elegant bishop's residence in the suburb of Olivos. He took public transportation and cooked his own meals. He limited his time in Rome to \"lightning visits\". He was known to be devoted to St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, and he enclosed a small picture of her in the letters he wrote, calling her \"a great missionary saint\".\n\nAfter Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, Bergoglio attended his funeral and was considered one of the papabile for succession to the papacy. He participated as a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. In the National Catholic Reporter, John L. Allen Jr. reported that Bergoglio was a frontrunner in the 2005 conclave. In September 2005, the Italian magazine Limes published claims that Bergoglio had been the runner-up and main challenger to Cardinal Ratzinger at that conclave and that he had received 40 votes in the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot. The claims were based on a diary purportedly belonging to an anonymous cardinal who had been present at the conclave. According to the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, this number of votes had no precedent for a Latin American papabile. La Stampa reported that Bergoglio was in close contention with Ratzinger during the election, until he made an emotional plea that the cardinals should not vote for him. According to Tornielli, Bergoglio made this request to prevent the conclave from delaying too much in the election of a pope.\n\nAs a cardinal, Bergoglio was associated with Communion and Liberation, a Catholic evangelical lay movement of the type known as associations of the faithful. He sometimes made appearances at the annual gathering known as the Rimini Meeting held during the late summer months in Italy. In 2005, Cardinal Bergoglio authorized the request for beatification\u2014the third step towards sainthood\u2014for six members of the Pallottine community murdered in the San Patricio Church massacre. At the same time, Bergoglio ordered an investigation into the murders themselves, which had been widely blamed on the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that ruled Argentina at the time.\n\nRelations with Argentine governments\n\nDirty War \n\nBergoglio was the subject of allegations regarding the Navy's kidnapping of two Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Franz Jalics, in May 1976, during Argentina's Dirty War. He feared for the priests' safety and had tried to change their work prior to their arrest; however, contrary to reports, he never tried to throw them out of the Jesuit order. In 2005, Myriam Bregman, a human rights lawyer, filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the kidnapping. Her complaint did not specify how Bergoglio was involved; Bergoglio's spokesman flatly denied the allegations. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. The priests were tortured, but were found alive five months later, drugged and semi-naked. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the authorities that he endorsed their work. Yorio, who died in 2000, said in a 1999 interview that he believed that Bergoglio did nothing \"to free us, in fact just the opposite\". Jalics initially refused to discuss the complaint after moving into seclusion in a German monastery. However, two days after the election of Francis, Jalics issued a statement confirming the kidnapping and attributing the cause to a former lay colleague who became a guerrilla, was captured, then named Yorio and Jalics when interrogated. The following week, Jalics issued a second, clarifying statement: \"It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio (\u2026) the fact is, Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio.\"\n\nBergoglio told his authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, that after the priests' imprisonment, he worked behind the scenes for their release; Bergoglio's intercession with dictator Jorge Rafael Videla on their behalf may have saved their lives. Bergoglio also told Rubin that he had often sheltered people from the dictatorship on church property, and once gave his own identity papers to a man who looked like him, so he could flee Argentina. The interview with Rubin, reflected in the biography El jesuita, is the only time Bergoglio has spoken to the press about those events. Alicia Oliveira, a former Argentine judge, has also reported that Bergoglio helped people flee Argentina during the rule of the junta. Since Francis became pope, Gonzalo Mosca and Jos\u00e9 Caravias have related to journalists accounts of how Bergoglio helped them flee the Argentine dictatorship.\n\nOliveira described the future pope as \"anguished\" and \"very critical of the dictatorship\" during the Dirty War. Oliveira met with him at the time and urged Bergoglio to speak out\u2014he told her that \"he couldn't. That it wasn't an easy thing to do.\" Artist and human rights activist Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel, the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said: \"Perhaps he didn't have the courage of other priests, but he never collaborated with the dictatorship. \u2026Bergoglio was no accomplice of the dictatorship.\" Graciela Fern\u00e1ndez Meijide, member of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, also said that there was no proof linking Bergoglio with the dictatorship. She told the Clar\u00edn newspaper: \"There is no information and Justice couldn't prove it. I was in the APDH during all the dictatorship years and I received hundreds of testimonies. Bergoglio was never mentioned. It was the same in the CONADEP. Nobody mentioned him as instigator or as anything.\" Ricardo Lorenzetti, President of the Argentine Supreme Court, also has said that Bergoglio is \"completely innocent\" of the accusations. Historian Uki Go\u00f1i pointed that, during early 1976, the military junta still had a good image among society, and that the scale of the political repression was not known until much later; Bergoglio would have had little reason to suspect that the detention of Yorio and Jalics could end up in their deaths.\n\nWhen Bergoglio became pope, an alleged photo of him giving the sacramental bread to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became popular in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper P\u00e1gina/12. The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Ber\u00f3n de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church \"Peque\u00f1a Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione\" in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the Cr\u00f3nica newspaper.\n\nFernando de la R\u00faa \nFernando de la R\u00faa replaced Carlos Menem as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral on the First National Government holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society. Argentina faced an economic depression at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la R\u00faa asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was canceled because of a misunderstanding by De la R\u00faa's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop Jorge Casaretto considers it unlikely, as De la R\u00faa only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.\n\nThe Justicialist Party won the 2001 elections and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed Ram\u00f3n Puerta as president of the Senate. As vice president Carlos \u00c1lvarez resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the order of precedence. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la R\u00faa, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.\n\nDuring police repression of the riots of December 2001, he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters and vandals from peaceful protesters.\n\nN\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner \n\nWhen Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the cathedral for the 2004 First National Government holiday, President N\u00e9stor Kirchner attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements. Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the cathedral was suspended. In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit Joaqu\u00edn Pi\u00f1a to win the elections in the Misiones Province and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution. Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010. Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during disturbances in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators. The campaign to enact same-sex marriage legislation was a particularly tense period in their relations.\n\nWhen Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper P\u00e1gina/12 published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the National Library described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a \"Copernican shift\" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon. On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner. They exchanged gifts and lunched together. This was the new pope's first meeting with a head of state, and there was speculation that the two were mending their relations. P\u00e1gina/12 removed their controversial articles about Bergoglio, written by Horacio Verbitsky, from their web page, as a result of this change.\n\nPapacy (2013\u2013present) \n\nElected at 76 years old, Francis was reported to be healthy and his doctors have said his missing lung tissue, removed in his youth, does not significantly affect his health. The only concern would be decreased respiratory reserve if he had a respiratory infection. In the past, one attack of sciatica in 2007 prevented him from attending a consistory and delayed his return to Argentina for several days. Francis is the first Jesuit pope. This was a significant appointment, because of the sometimes tense relations between the Society of Jesus and the Holy See. However, Bergoglio came in second to Cardinal Ratzinger on all the ballots in the 2005 conclave, and at the time appeared as the only other viable candidate.\nHe is also the first from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Many media reported him as being the first non-European pope, but he is actually the 11th; the previous was Gregory III from Syria, who died in 741. Moreover, although Francis was not born in Europe, he is ethnically European; his father and both of his mother's parents are from northern Italy.\n\nAs pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as \"no frills\", noting that it is \"his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration.\" On the night of his election, he took a bus back to his hotel with the cardinals, rather than be driven in the papal car. The next day, he visited Cardinal Jorge Mar\u00eda Mej\u00eda in the hospital and chatted with patients and staff. At his first media audience, the Saturday after his election, the pope explained his papal name choice, citing Saint Francis of Assisi as \"the man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man\", and he added \"[h]ow I would like a poor Church, and for the poor\".\n\nIn addition to his native Spanish, he speaks fluent Italian (the official language of Vatican City and the \"everyday language\" of the Holy See) and German. He is also conversant in Latin (the official language of the Holy See), French, Portuguese, and English, and he understands the Piedmontese language and some Genoese.\n\nFrancis chose not to live in the official papal residence in the Apostolic Palace, but to remain in the Vatican guest house, in a suite in which he can receive visitors and hold meetings. He is the first pope since Pope Pius X to live outside the papal apartments. Francis still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus.\n\nElection \n\nBergoglio was elected pope on 13 March 2013, the second day of the 2013 papal conclave, taking the papal name Francis. Francis was elected on the fifth ballot of the conclave. The Habemus papam announcement was delivered by the cardinal protodeacon, Jean-Louis Tauran. Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn later said that Bergoglio was elected following two supernatural signs, one in the conclave and hence confidential, and a Latin-American couple of friends of Sch\u00f6nborn who whispered Bergoglio's name in Sch\u00f6nborn's ear; Sch\u00f6nborn commented \"if these people say Bergoglio, that's an indication of the Holy Spirit\".\n\nInstead of accepting his cardinals' congratulations while seated on the papal throne, Francis received them standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at the Vatican. During his first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta used by previous popes. He also wore the same iron pectoral cross that he had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by his predecessors.\n\nAfter being elected and choosing his name, his first act was bestowing the Urbi et Orbi blessing on thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square. Before blessing the crowd, he asked those in St. Peter's Square to pray for his predecessor, \"the bishop emeritus of Rome\" Pope Benedict XVI, and for himself as the new \"bishop of Rome\".\n\nFrancis held his papal inauguration on 19 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. He celebrated Mass in the presence of various political and religious leaders from around the world. In his homily Francis focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated.\n\nName \n\nAt his first audience on 16 March 2013, Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, \"Don't forget the poor\", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that \"He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history.\"\n\nThis is the first time that a pope has been named Francis. On the day of his election, the Vatican clarified that his official papal name was \"Francis\", not \"Francis I\", i.e. no regnal number is used for him. A Vatican spokesman said that the name would become Francis I if and when there is a Francis II. It is the first time since Lando's 913\u2013914 pontificate that a serving pope holds a name not used by a predecessor.\n\nFrancis also said that some cardinal electors had jokingly suggested to him that he should choose either \"Adrian\", since Adrian VI had been a reformer of the church, or \"Clement\" to settle the score with Clement XIV, who had suppressed the Jesuit order. In February 2014, it was reported that Bergoglio, had he been elected in 2005, would have chosen the pontifical name of \"John XXIV\" in honor of John XXIII. It was said that he told Cardinal Francesco Marchisano: \"John, I would have called myself John, like the Good Pope; I would have been completely inspired by him\".\n\nCuria \n\nOn 16 March 2013, Francis asked all those in senior positions of the Roman Curia to provisionally continue in office. He named Alfred Xuereb as his personal secretary. On 6 April he named Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo as secretary for the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, a position that had been vacant for several months. Francis abolished the bonuses paid to Vatican employees upon the election of a new pope, amounting to several million Euros, opting instead to donate the money to charity. He also abolished the \u20ac25,000 annual bonus paid to the cardinals serving on the Board of Supervisors for the Vatican bank.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, he named eight cardinals to a new Council of Cardinal Advisers to advise him on revising the organizational structure of the Roman Curia. The group included several known as critics of Vatican operations and only one member of the Curia. They are Giuseppe Bertello, president of the Vatican City State governorate; Francisco Javier Errazuriz Ossa from Chile; Oswald Gracias from India; Reinhard Marx from Germany; Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; George Pell from Australia; Se\u00e1n O'Malley from the United States; and \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga from Honduras. He appointed Bishop Marcello Semeraro secretary for the group and scheduled its first meeting for 1\u20133 October.\n\nEarly issues \nIn March 2013, 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked Francis to allow married men in Great Britain to be ordained as priests, keeping celibacy as the rule for bishops. They asked it on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men cannot do the same.\n\nFouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, included a call in his 2013 Easter homily for the pope to visit Jerusalem. Louis Raphael I, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, asked the pope to visit the \"embattled Christian community\" in Iraq. In March 2021, Pope Francis went to Iraq on a first-ever papal visit to the diminishing Christian communities of Mesopotamia fallen apart after years of conflict.\n\nOn the first Holy Thursday following his election, Francis washed and kissed the feet of ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility, telling them the ritual of foot washing is a sign that he is at their service. This was the first time that a pope had included women in this ritual; although he had already done so when he was archbishop. One of the male and one of the female prisoners were Muslim.\n\nOn 31 March 2013, Francis used his first Easter homily to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea. He also spoke out against those who give in to \"easy gain\" in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment. He said that \"[w]e ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\" Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, Francis chose not to read them. According to the Vatican, the pope \"at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See\".\n\nIn 2013, Francis initially reaffirmed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's program to reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The New York Times reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the sisters' group was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine. However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close. While the timing of the closure may have anticipated a visit by Francis to the U.S. in September 2015, it was noted that the sisters' emphasis is close to that of Francis.\n\nOn 12 May, Francis carried out his first canonizations of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena, the second female Mexican saint, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Zavala, both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto. He said: \"While we venerate the martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give them the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness.\"\n\nSynodal church \n\nFrancis has overseen synods on the family (2014), on youth (2018), and on the Church in the Amazon region (2019). In 2019 Francis' apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio allowed that the final document of a synod may become magisterial teaching simply with papal approval. The constitution also allowed for laity to contribute input directly to the synod's secretary general. Some analysts see the creation of a truly synodal church as likely to become the greatest contribution of Francis' papacy.\n\nConsultation with Catholic laity \n\nA February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time shows how the unity Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. In the same month Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire described as a \"much broader consultation than just a survey\" regarding opinions among the laity. He continued to assert Catholic doctrine, in less dramatic tone than his recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.\n\nLinda Woodhead of Lancaster University wrote of the survey Francis initiated, \"it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.\" Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.\n\nThe Catholic Church in England and Wales  had refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in Germany and Austria, published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.\n\nIn a column he wrote for the Vatican's semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the then-Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, American cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who has a long-standing reputation as one of the church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that Francis opposed both abortion and gay marriage. The Vatican's chief spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, also noted in the Vatican press office during the 2014 consistory meetings that Francis and Cardinal Walter Kasper would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to Church theology on doctrinal matters.\n\nInstitute for the Works of Religion \nIn the first months of Francis's papacy, the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank, said that it would become more transparent in its financial dealings There had long been allegations of corruption and money laundering connected with the bank. Francis appointed a commission to advise him about reform of the Bank, and the finance consulting firm Promontory Financial Group was assigned to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all customer contacts of the bank on these facts. Because of this affair the Promoter of Justice at the Vatican Tribunal applied a letter rogatory for the first time in the history of the Republic of Italy at the beginning of August 2013. In January 2014, Francis replaced four of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacy. Lay experts and clerics were looking into how the bank was run. Ernst von Freyberg was put in charge. Moneyval feels more reform is needed, and Francis may be willing to close the bank if the reforms prove too difficult. There is uncertainty how far reforms can succeed.\n\nPapal documents \nOn 29 June 2013, Francis published the encyclical Lumen fidei, which was largely the work of Benedict XVI but awaiting a final draft at his retirement. On 24 November 2013, Francis published his first major letter as pope, the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium, which he described as the programmatic of his papacy. On 18 June 2015, he published his first own, original encyclical Laudato si' concerning care for the planet. On 8 April 2016, Francis published his second apostolic exhortation, Amoris laetitia, remarking on love within the family. Controversy arose at the end of 2016 when four cardinals formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.\n\nHis motu proprios include Ai nostri tempi and De concordia inter codices. Francis issued another titled Maiorem hac dilectionem which created a new path towards canonization for certain causes.\n\nHe established two new Secretariats (top-level departments) in the Roman Curia: the Secretariat for the Economy, and the Secretariat for Communications. He simplified the process for declaring matrimonial nullity.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Francis signed a new apostolic constitution on ecclesiastical universities and faculties Veritatis gaudium, published 29 January 2018.\n\nA further Apostolic Exhortation, Gaudete et exsultate (Rejoice and be glad), was published on 19 March 2018, dealing with \"the call to holiness in today's world\" for all persons. He counters contemporary versions of the gnostic and Pelagian heresies and describes how Jesus' beatitudes call people to \"go against the flow\".\n\nIn February 2019, Francis acknowledged that priests and bishops were sexually abusing religious sisters. He addressed this and the clergy sex abuse scandal by convening a summit on clergy sexual abuse in Rome 21\u201324 February 2019. As a follow-up to that summit, on 9 May 2019 Francis promulgated the motu proprio Vos estis lux mundi which specified responsibilities, including reporting directly to the Holy See on bishops and on one's superior, while simultaneously involving another bishop in the archdiocese of the accused bishop.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, he published the apostolic letter Scripturae sacrae affectus to celebrate the 16th centenary of the death of Jerome.\n\nOn 4 October 2020 on the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, Francis published the encyclical Fratelli tutti on fraternity and social friendship, using St. Francis' own words to describe our universal brotherhood and sisterhood.\n\nOn 8 December 2020 on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Francis published the apostolic letter Patris corde (\"With a Father's Heart\"). To mark the occasion, the Pope proclaimed a \"Year of Saint Joseph\" from 8 December 2020, to 8 December 2021 on the 150th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Saint Joseph as Patron of the Universal Church.\n\nOn 1 June 2021, Francis published the apostolic constitution Pascite gregem Dei.\n\nPope Francis issued the motu proprio Traditionis custodes on 16 July 2021. The document abrogated the permissions for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass previously established by Benedict XVI in the 2007 Summorum Pontificum, with Traditionis custodes instituting increased restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. Pope Francis stated in a letter accompanying the motu proprio that emphasizing the Mass of Paul VI would bring \"unity I intend to re-establish throughout the Church of the Roman Rite.\"\n\nEcumenism and interreligious dialogue \n\nPope Francis continued in the tradition of the Second Vatican Council and of the papacies since the Council in promoting ecumenism with other Christian denominations, as well as encouraging dialogue with leaders of other religions; he has also supported peace with those claiming no religious belief.\n\nClerical titles \n\nIn January 2014, Francis said that he would appoint fewer monsignors and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, chaplain of His Holiness. It would be awarded only to diocesan priests at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.\n\nCanonizations and beatifications \n\nFrancis presided over the first canonizations of his pontificate on 12 May 2013 in which he canonized the Martyrs of Otranto. Antonio Primaldo and his 812 companions who had been executed by the Ottomans in 1480, as well as the religious sisters Laura of St. Catherine of Siena and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Zavala \u2013 in this first canonization he surpassed the record of Pope John Paul II in canonizing the most saints in a pontificate. Francis approved the equipollent canonization of Angela of Foligno the following 9 October and then the Jesuit Peter Faber the following 17 December.\n\nThe pope approved further equipollent canonizations on 3 April 2014 for the Jesuit Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta as well as the Ursuline nun Marie of the Incarnation and bishop Fran\u00e7ois de Laval. Francis canonized his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II on 27 April 2014 and canonized six additional saints the following 23 November. The pope canonized Joseph Vaz on his visit to Sri Lanka on 14 January 2015 and canonized a further four saints on the following 17 May; he canonized Jun\u00edpero Serra on 23 September while visiting the United States and then canonized four saints on 18 October including the first married couple to be named as saints. Francis canonized Maria Elisabeth Hesselblad and Stanislaus Papczy\u0144ski on 5 June 2016 and then canonized Teresa of Calcutta on 4 September; he canonized seven additional saints on 16 October. The pope canonized the two child visionaries Francisco and Jacinta Marto during his visit to F\u00e1tima in mid-2017 and canonized 35 additional saints on 15 October. Francis recognized seven saints on 14 October 2018, chief among them, his predecessor Pope Paul VI and \u00d3scar Romero. Francis later confirmed the equipollent canonization for Bartholomew of Braga in mid-2019. On 13 October 2019, Francis canonized five new saints, including Cardinal John Henry Newman. The pope confirmed the equipollent canonization for Margherita della Metola on 24 April 2021.\n\nThe pope has also continued the practice of having beatifications celebrated in the place of the individual's origin though has presided over beatifications himself on three occasions: for Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions on 16 August 2014, his predecessor Pope Paul VI on 19 October 2014, and two Colombian martyrs on 8 September 2017. The pope has approved beatifications for a range of men and women including the likes of \u00c1lvaro del Portillo of Opus Dei (27 September 2014), the martyred archbishop \u00d3scar Romero (23 May 2015), the prominent Polish cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski (12 September 2021), and several large groups of Spanish martyrs.\n\nFrancis also confirmed his predecessor John Paul I to be Venerable on 8 November 2017.\n\nDoctors of the Church \nOn 21 February 2015, Francis signed a decree naming Saint Gregory of Narek as the 36th Doctor of the Church; he formally conferred the title upon the saint at a ceremony held in Saint Peter's Basilica on 12 April 2015 with delegations from the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church present. On 20 January 2022, Francis provided his approval to the suggestion to name Saint Irenaeus of Lyon as the 37th Doctor of the Church, formally conferring the title upon him, along with the supplementary title Doctor unitatis (\"Doctor of Unity\") in a decree issued on 21 January.\n\nConsistories \n\nAt the first consistory of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as Chibly Langlois from Haiti and Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso. The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, appeared together in public.\n\nBenedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar and Soane Patita Paini Mafi of Tonga.\n\nFrancis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as Patrick D'Rozario from Bangladesh and Dieudonn\u00e9 Nzapalainga from the Central African Republic, while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.\n\nThe pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of five new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.\n\nFrancis presided over his fifth consistory for the elevation of 14 new cardinals on 28 June 2018. The first eleven were under the age of eighty, and therefore, were eligible to vote in a future papal conclave while the last three were over the age of eighty, and thus, ineligible to vote in a papal conclave. The pope continued the practice of naming the Vicar of Rome and a curial prefect as cardinals, while naming his substitute for the Secretariat of State in anticipation of his transferral to a curial department. The pope also continued his practice of bestowing the red hat on those from peripheries such as Madagascar, Pakistan, and Iraq, and like in 2016, created a priest as a cardinal. The consistory was also noteworthy for the fact that Francis named the papal almoner Konrad Krajewski as a cardinal, marking the consistory the first occasion where the almoner was made a cardinal. Francis himself later said that he wanted the office of almoner to receive the red hat going forward as it was an important arm of the Vatican.\n\nOn 1 September 2019, following his weekly Sunday Angelus address, Francis unexpectedly announced the appointment of 13 new cardinals. Of these, 10 appointees were under the age of 80 and would therefore become cardinal electors, besides three over 80. The new cardinals were formally installed at the consistory celebrated on 5 October 2019. Most of the new cardinals come from the peripheries of the church and developing countries. Two new appointees were from Muslim majority countries (Morocco and Indonesia), while two others were known for their work on refugee and migration issues. This action took the number of cardinal electors appointed by Francis to the College of Cardinals to about 70 out of nearly 130.\n\nFrancis created thirteen new cardinals on 28 November 2020; nine appointees were under the age of 80, therefore, could vote in a future papal conclave. The pope also nominated four cardinals over the age of 80. Most of these new appointees continued the trend that Francis adhered to, appointing the first cardinals to represent Brunei and Rwanda. Francis also nominated the first African American cardinal (Gregory), while naming the first Conventual Franciscan (Gambetti) in almost 160 years, and the first from Siena (Lojudice) since 1801. Three of his appointees were only priests upon their nomination, therefore, two (Gambetti and Feroci) received their episcopal consecration, while one (Cantalamessa) was granted a papal dispensation from it.\n\nYear of Mercy \n\nWith his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\nThe Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion. During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.\n\nFrancis established the World Day of the Poor in his Apostolic Letter, Misericordia et Misera, issued on 20 November 2016 to celebrate the end of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Francis canceled his regular general audiences at St. Peter's Square to prevent crowds from gathering and spreading the virus, which seriously affected Italy. He encouraged priests to visit patients and health workers; urged the faithful not to forget the poor during the time of crisis; offered prayers for victims of the virus in China; and invoked the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title Salus Populi Romani, as the Diocese of Rome observed a period of prayer and fasting in recognition of the victims. The pontiff reacted with displeasure on 13 March 2020, at the news that the Vicar General had closed all churches in the Diocese of Rome. Despite Italy being under a quarantine lockdown, Francis pleaded \"not to leave the ... people alone\" and worked to partially reverse the closures.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Francis asked the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development (DPIHD) to create a Vatican COVID-19 Commission to express the Church's concern for the crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and propose responses to the potential socio-economic challenges deriving from it.\n\nOn 27 March, Francis gave an extraordinary benediction Urbi et Orbi. In his homily on calming the storm in the Gospel of Mark, Francis described the setting: \"Dense darkness has thickened on our squares, streets and cities; it looks over our lives filling everything with a deafening silence and a desolate void that paralyzes everything in its passage: you can feel it in the air, you can feel it in your gestures. ...In the face of suffering, where the true development of our peoples is measured, we discover and experience the priestly prayer of Jesus: 'may all be one'.\"\n\nFrancis maintains getting COVID vaccination is a moral obligation.  Francis stated that people had a responsibility to look after themselves, \u201cand this translates into respect for the health of those around us. Health care is a moral obligation\u201d, he stated.<ref>Pope Francis has said getting vaccinated against coronavirus is a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d and denounced how naysayers had been swayed by \u201cbaseless information\u201d. The Guardian;;</ref>\n\n Russo-Ukrainian War \nFollowing the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Francis visited the Russian embassy in Rome in what was described as an \"unprecedented move.\" Francis called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating his \"sorrow\" as the Vatican worked to find \"room for negotiation.\" As the invasion began, the major archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk cancelled a trip to visit Francis in Florence. On 25 February, the day after the invasion began, Francis would assure Shevchuk via a phone call that \"he would do everything he can to help end the Ukraine conflict.\" During the 27 February Angelus address, Francis called for peace, saying, \"Silence the weapons!\"\n\n Role of women \n\nOn 11 January 2021, Francis allowed bishops to institute women to the ministries of acolyte and lector. While these instituted ministries were previously reserved to men, Catholic women already carry out these duties without institution in most of the world. Francis wrote that these ministries are fundamentally distinct from those reserved to ordained clergy.\n\nIn February 2021, Francis announced back-to-back appointments of women to take positions that were only held by men in the past. He appointed France\u2019s member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, Nathalie Becquart as the first co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops. Besides, an Italian magistrate, Catia Summaria also became the first woman Promoter of Justice in the Vatican\u2019s Court of Appeals.\n\n Financial corruption \nFrancis was mandated by electing cardinals to sort out Vatican finances following scandals during the papacies of Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II.  He stated he is determined to end corruption in the Catholic Church but is not very optimistic due to a human problem dating back centuries.\n\n Theological emphases \n\nIn Evangelii gaudium Francis revealed what would be the emphases of his pontificate: a missionary impulse among all Catholics, sharing the faith more actively, avoiding worldliness and more visibly living the gospel of God's mercy, and helping the poor and working for social justice.\n\n Evangelization \n\nFrom his first major letter Evangelii gaudium (Joy to the World), Francis called for \"a missionary and pastoral conversion\" whereby the laity would fully share in the missionary task of the church. Then in his letter on the call of all to the same holiness, Gaudete et exsultate, Fancis describes holiness as \"an impulse to evangelize and to leave a mark in this world\".\n\n Church governance \n\nFrancis called for decentralization of governance away from Rome, and for a synodal manner of decision making in dialogue with the people. He strongly opposed clericalism and made women full members of the Church's dicasteries in Rome.\n\n Environment \nFrancis' naming of himself after Francis of Assisi was an early indication of how he shared Francis' care for all of creation. This was followed in May 2015 with his major encyclical on the environment, Laudato si' (Praise be to you).\n\n Option for the poor \n\nFrancis has highly extolled \"popular movements\", which demonstrate the \"strength of us\", serve as a remedy to the \"culture of the self\", and are based on solidarity with the poor and the common good.\n\n Morality \nCardinal Walter Kasper has called mercy \"the key word of his pontificate.\" His papal motto Miserando atque eligendo (\"by having mercy and by choosing\") contains a central theme of his papacy, God's mercy, While maintaining the Church's traditional teaching against abortion, Francis, has referred to the \"obsession\" of some Catholics with a few issues like \"abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods\" which \"do not show the heart of the message of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n LGBT \n\nIn June 2013, Francis suggested that \"if a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Later, in 2015, he declared that \"the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage.\" He has also suggested that same-sex marriage \"disfigures God's plan for creation.\"\n\nHe stated that he supports legally recognising same-sex civil unions in a statement from an interview published in October 2020; this passage was from an interview from 2019, but this passage had been cut from public releases at the time. The statement was also interpreted as supportive of LGBT adoption.What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable because of it.\nHowever, Vatican later clarified that his comments were taken out of context with two comments to two different questions at different times spliced together in a very misleading way. Francis has never officially pronounced support for gay civil unions. Francis also endorsed the 2015 Slovak same-sex marriage referendum which would have banned same-sex adoptions in the country.\n\nIn January 2022, Francis said during a weekly audience that parents of gay children should offer support to their children instead of condemning them.\n\n Religious persecution \n\nFrancis supported the use of force to stop Islamic militants from attacking religious minorities in Iraq. In January 2018, Francis met with a group of Yazidi refugees in Europe and expressed his support for their right to freely profess their own faith without limitations. In the meeting, he also urged the international community \"not to remain a silent and unresponsive spectator in the face of [your] tragedy.\"\n\n Controversies \nSince 2016, criticism against Francis by theological conservatives has intensified. One commentator has described the conservative resistance against Francis as \"unique in its visibility\" in recent Church history. Some have explained the level of disagreement as due to his going beyond theoretical principles to pastoral discernment.\n\n Sexual abuse response \n\nAs cardinal, in 2010 Bergoglio commissioned a study which concluded that Father Julio Grassi, a priest convicted of child sexual abuse, was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case against him never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against Grassi in March 2017. Francis has admitted that the Church \"arrived late\" in dealing with sexual abuse cases. During his papacy, a number of abuse survivors have expressed disappointment in Francis's response to sex abuse in the Church while others have praised him for his actions.\n\nIn 2015, Francis was criticized for supporting Chilean bishop Juan Barros, who was accused of covering up sex crimes committed against minors. In 2018, Francis acknowledged he had made \"grave errors\" in judgment about Barros, apologized to the victims and launched a Vatican investigation that resulted in the resignation of Barros and two other Chilean bishops. In 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 published an open letter denouncing Francis's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Theodore McCarrick, accusing him of knowing about allegations that McCarrick had committed sexual abuse and failing to take action. Vigan\u00f2 called on the Pope to resign.\n\nIn November 2021, Francis thanked journalists for their \"mission\" on uncovering sex abuse scandals in the Church, adding that it made of the cases \"less obscure (...) to make those who live it less fear it.\"\n\n Theological disagreements \n Amoris laetitia and the communion to the divorced and civilly remarried \n\nOn a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia, especially regarding whether the exhortation had changed the Catholic Church's sacramental discipline concerning access to the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist for divorced couples who have civilly remarried. Francis had written that \"It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church.\" He called not for \"a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases,\" but \"a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases.\" He went on to say: \u201cIt is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.\u201d\n\nFour cardinals (Raymond Leo Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandm\u00fcller, and Joachim Meisner) formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics. They submitted five \"dubia\" (doubts), and requested a yes or no answer. Francis has not publicly replied. The exhortation has been implemented in different ways by various bishops around the world.\n\nCardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, maintained that Amoris Laetitia should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal M\u00fcller, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist only if they take on the duty of living in complete continence. Francis subsequently announced that dicastery prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced M\u00fcller at the end of his term in 2017 with Luis Ladaria Ferrer. Cardinal Carlo Caffarra, one of the authors of the dubia, maintains that after Amoris laetitia \"only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Church.\"\n\nIn July 2017 a group of conservative clergy, academics and laymen signed a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis. The 25-page document, which was made public in September after it received no reply, criticized the pope for promoting what it described as seven heretical propositions through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate. Capuchin Father Thomas Weinandy, ex-doctrine chief of US Bishops, wrote a letter to Francis on 31 July 2017, which he subsequently made public, in which he charged that Francis is fostering \"chronic confusion\", \"demeaning\" the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who \"scandalize\" believers with dubious \"teaching and pastoral practice\", giving prelates who object the impression they will be \"marginalized or worse\" if they speak out, and causing faithful Catholics to \"lose confidence in their supreme shepherd\".\n\n Document on Human Fraternity \n\nThe Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is a joint statement signed by Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, on 4 February 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This joint statement is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the \"pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, through which He created human beings\". Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that this sentence was \"puzzling, and potentially problematic\". Some Catholic observers tried to understand it as an allusion to the \"permissive will\" of God, allowing evil on earth. Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be \"evidence of our natural desire to know God\". On 8 February 2019 Bishop Athanasius Schneider released a document entitled \"The Gift of Filial Adoption, the Christian Faith: the only valid and the only God-willed religion\".\n\n Traditionis custodes and the restriction of the Tridentine Mass \n\nIn July 2021, Francis issued, motu proprio, the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which reversed the decision of his immediate predecessor Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. The letter returned to the bishops the power to grant or suppress the Latin Mass in their particular dioceses, and requires newly ordained priests to first request permission before performing the old rite, among other changes. \"Traditionis Custodes, which Pope Francis published and came into immediate effect on July 16, has been criticized by prelates such as Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard M\u00fcller and Joseph Zen, as well as many lay faithful who attend the traditional Latin Mass, also called Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. The most general criticism is that the restrictions are unnecessary, needlessly harsh, and implemented in an unjustifiably swift fashion.\"\n\n International policy \n\nFrancis has regularly been accused by conservatives of having a \"soft spot\" for leftist populist movements. After Francis's visit to Cuba in 2015, Catholic Yale historian Carlos Eire said Francis had a \"preferential option for the oppressors\" in Cuba. Nevertheless, Francis remained hostile to right-wing populism.\n\nFrancis has supported the Vatican-China agreement, intended to normalize the situation of China's Catholics, which was criticized by Cardinal Joseph Zen as a step towards the \"annihilation\" of the Catholic Church in China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party puts the pope's moral authority at risk. In September 2020, Pompeo urged Francis to stand against China's human rights violations. In November, Francis named China's Uyghur minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. He wrote: \"I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya [Muslims in Myanmar], the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi\u2014what ISIS did to them was truly cruel\u2014or Christians in Egypt and Pakistan killed by bombs that went off while they prayed in church.\" Zhao Lijian, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of China, said Francis\u2019 remarks had \"no factual basis at all\".\n\nSince 2016, Francis has also been contrasted with US President Donald Trump, elected that year, with some conservative critics drawing comparisons between the two. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Francis said of Trump, \"A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. That is not the gospel.\" Trump responded, \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" Federico Lombardi said that Francis' comments were not \"a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for\".\n\nIn response to criticism from Venezuela's bishops, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said in 2017 that he had the support of Francis. Francis met with the country's bishops in June 2017, and the Venezuelan bishops' conference president stated, \"There is no distance between the episcopal conference and the Holy See.\" In January 2019, 20 former presidents in Latin America wrote a letter to Francis criticizing his Christmas address regarding the ongoing Venezuelan crisis for being too simplistic and for not acknowledging what they believed to be the causes of the suffering of the victims of the crisis. Francis has sought peace in the crisis without picking a side.\n\nIn 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Francis was criticized by Catholic clergy in Hong Kong, with Cardinal Joseph Zen criticizing him for not taking a stand against China and instead being quoted as saying \"I would like to go to China. I love China\". Francis compared the protests in Hong Kong to those seen in Chile and in France.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country, Francis said that the withdrawal of troops was \"legitimate\" but said that the process of evacuations was \"not thought through\" and criticized the war for having failed at nation-building. He also stated that the Vatican is in talks with the Taliban through Cardinal Pietro Parolin to discourage the Taliban on taking reprisal measures against civilians.\n\n International diplomatic role \n\nFrancis played a key role in the talks toward restoring full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The restoration was jointly announced by U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro on 17 December 2014. The headline in the Los Angeles Times on 19 December was \"Bridge to Cuba via Vatican,\" with the further lead \"In a rare and crucial role, Francis helped keep U.S. talks with Havana on track and guided final deal.\" The pope, along with the Government of Canada, was a behind-the-scenes broker of the agreement, taking the role following President Obama's request during his visit to the pope in March 2014. The success of the negotiations was credited to Francis because \"as a religious leader with the confidence of both sides, he was able to convince the Obama and Castro administrations that the other side would live up to the deal\". En route to the United States for a visit in September 2015, the pope stopped in Cuba. \"The plan comes amid a breakthrough for which Francis has received much credit.\" The Cuba visit \"seals that accomplishment, in which he served as a bridge between two erstwhile enemies\". According to one expert on religion in Latin America, Mario Paredes, the pope's visit to Cuba was consistent with his aim to promote an understanding of the role of the Cuban Revolution and that of the Catholic Church. When Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he authored a text entitled \"Dialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro\". John Paul was the first pope to visit Cuba. In May 2015, Francis met with Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro. After the meeting in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he was considering returning to the Catholic Church. He said in a televised news conference, \"I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Catholic] church. I am not joking.\" Castro said that, when the pope came, \"I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction\".\n\nIn May 2014, his visit to the State of Israel, where he delivered 13 speeches, was heavily publicized. Protests against his visit resulted in an alleged arson attempt at the Dormition Abbey. The cave under the Church of the Nativity caught fire the night after his visit.\n\nIn May 2015, Francis welcomed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to the Vatican. Several media outlets reported that Francis praised Abbas as \"an angel of peace\", though his actual words were the following: \"The angel of peace destroys the evil spirit of war. I thought about you: may you be an angel of peace.\" The Vatican signed a treaty recognizing the state of Palestine. The Vatican issued statements concerning the hope that the peace talks could resume between Israel and Palestine. Abbas' visit was on the occasion of the canonization of two Palestinian nuns.\n\nOn 6 June 2015, Francis visited Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He urged peace during his time in the religiously diverse city, known as the \"Jerusalem of Europe\".\n\nOn 25 September 2015, Francis addressed the United Nations in New York City.\n\nOn 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronimos II of Athens, the Moria Refugee Camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. There the three Christian leaders signed a joint declaration.\n\nIn January 2017, Francis demanded the resignation of Matthew Festing, the 79th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Pope's demand came as a response to Festing and Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke firing Baron Albrecht von Boeselager from his position in the Order of Malta. The Order, in May 2017, appointed a new leader in the person of Fra' Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto.\n\nOn 24 May 2017, Francis met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vatican City, where they discussed the contributions of Catholics to the United States and to the world. They discussed issues of mutual concern, including how religious communities can combat human suffering in crisis regions, such as Syria, Libya, and ISIS-controlled territory. They also discussed terrorism and the radicalization of young people. The Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, raised the issue of climate change and encouraged Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. At the 2017 World Food Day ceremony, Francis reiterated that \"we see the consequences [of climate change] every day\" and that we \"know how the problems are to be faced ... [t]hanks to scientific knowledge.\" He said that \"the international community has drawn up the necessary legal instruments, such as the Paris Agreement, from which however some are withdrawing. There is a re-emergence of the nonchalance towards the delicate balances of ecosystems, the presumption of being able to manipulate and control the planet's limited resources, and greed for profit.\"\n\nFrancis visited Ireland in 2018, in what was the first papal tour of the country since John Paul II's historic trip in 1979. While in Ireland he apologized for abuses by clergy in the United States and Ireland.\n\nIn February 2019, Francis visited Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the invitation of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Francis became the first pope to hold a papal Mass on the Arabian Peninsula, with more than 120,000 attendees in the Zayed Sports City Stadium.\n\nFrancis made the plight of refugees and migrants \"a core component of his pastoral work\", and has defended their rights in dialogue both with Europe and with the United States. He went on to place a statue in St. Peter's Square to bring attention to the Christian imperative involved in their situation (Hebrews 13:2).\n\nIn March 2021, Pope Francis held a historic meeting with Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, Ur. Giving a message of peaceful coexistence, he and the Iraqi cleric urged the Muslim and Christian communities to work together in unity for peace.\n\nOn 9 May 2021, Francis called for peace between Israel and Palestinians and an end to clashes in Jerusalem during his Regina caeli address.\n\nOn 1 September 2021, Francis publicly defended the dialogue with China on the appointment of new bishops. Francis stated that uneasy dialogue was better than no dialogue at all, and emphasized in improving strained ties with the Chinese government.\n\nOn All Souls' Day, on 1 November 2021, Francis visited a war cemetery in Rome and paid tribute to fallen soldiers during the Battle of Anzio in World War II as well as at the Piave River, in Italy, during World War I. Francis also praised military casualties for \"fighting for their homeland and values.\" and called for global peace.\n\n Public image \n\nPopular mainstream media frequently portray Francis either as a progressive papal reformer or with liberal, moderate values. The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less-doctrinal tone of papacy, in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message. In the news media, both faithful and non-believers often refer to a \"honeymoon\" phase in which the pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated ecclesiastical reform in the Vatican. Media systems differ, too, not only in their coverage of Francis's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed. His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example. During this trip, American-based AP and British-based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope's journey while Prensa Latina, the official state media agency, depicted it as a diplomatic visit. American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media, which showed Francis interacting with elites most often.\n\nIn December 2013, both Time and The Advocate magazines named the Pontiff as their \"Person of the Year\" in praise and hopes of reforming the Roman Curia while hoping to change the Catholic Church's doctrine on various controversial issues. In addition, Esquire magazine named him as the \"Best-dressed man\" for 2013 for his simpler vestments often in tune with a modern simplistic design on sartorial fashion. Rolling Stone magazine followed in January 2014 by making the Pontiff their featured front cover. Fortune magazine also ranked Francis as number one in their list of 50 greatest leaders. On 5 November 2014, he was ranked by Forbes as the fourth most powerful person in the world and was the only non-political figure in the top ranking. In December 2016, Francis again made Forbess list of \"The World's Most Powerful People\", ranking fifth.\n\nIn March 2013, a new song was dedicated to Francis and released in Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Italian, titled Come Puoi (\"How You Can\"). Also in March, Pablo Buera, the mayor of La Plata, Argentina, announced that the city had renamed a section of a street leading up to a local cathedral Papa Francisco. There are already efforts to name other streets after him, as well as a school where he studied as a child. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Francis was made in Argentina's lower house on 28 November 2013. On the coins it would read, \"Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis.\" beneath his face. As of May 2013, sales of papal souvenirs, a sign of popularity, were up.\n\nFrancis presided over his first joint public wedding ceremony in a Nuptial Mass for 20 couples from the Archdiocese of Rome on 14 September 2014, just a few weeks before the start of the 5\u201319 October Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family.\n\nOn 19 March 2016, Francis became the first pope to create an Instagram account. He broke records after having gained over one million followers in under twelve hours of the account being up. In 2019 Francis held a conference on the World Day of Social Communications highlighting the pros and cons of social media and urging users to use it as a source that liberates rather than enslaves. On 26 November 2020 Francis became the first pope to write an op-ed for The New York Times, addressing issues such as the coronavirus and the need for global solidarity. The Pontiff also used his op-ed to strongly critique those protesting COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIn August 2021, rumors of a possible resignation arose due to health issues, but he dismissed those rumors in early September 2021, saying that he is \"living a normal life.\"\n\n Distinctions \n\n Titles and styles \nThe official form of address of the pope in English is His Holiness Pope Francis; in Latin, Franciscus, Episcopus Romae.

First performance: Capella Mariana 4 October 2015.\n\n Appreciation \nIn the oratorio Laudato si' by Peter Reulein (music) written on a libretto by Helmut Schlegel OFM, the figure of Francis appears next to Mary, Francis of Assisi, and Clare of Assisi. In the oratorio, Pope Franziskus suggests a bridge from the crucifixion scene on Golgotha to the suffering of the present. He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the encyclicals Laudato si' and Evangelii gaudium were used. The motto of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy also plays a central role. The oratorio was premiered on 6 November 2016 in the Limburg Cathedral.\n\n Coat of arms \n\n Writings \n\nPope Francis has written a variety of books, encyclicals, and other writings.\n\n Music album Wake Up! was released on 27 November 2015 by the label Believe Digital and contains speeches by Francis and accompanying music, including rock music.\n\n Films \n Documentary film \nBy 2015, there were two biographical films about Francis: Call Me Francesco (Italy, 2015), starring Rodrigo de la Serna, and Francis: Pray for me (Argentina, 2015), starring Dar\u00edo Grandinetti.Pope Francis: A Man of His Word is a documentary film with Swiss-Italian-French-German co-production, co-written and directed by Wim Wenders.

He was elected on 13 March 2013 by a two-thirds majority of the eligible cardinals in the 2013 papal conclave that followed the resignation of his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Ordained as a priest in 1969 in his native Argentina, Bergoglio embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1970s. He was appointed a full professor in 1980 at the age of 43. After a long career as a professor of theology and an academic administrator, Bergoglio was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. In 2001, he was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 2008, he was elected to the position of dean of the College of Cardinals. Bergoglio's pastoral style was different from that of his predecessors. He placed a strong emphasis on the Catholic Church's social teaching, and was considered a \"pope of the poor\" due to his extensive work with the poor and his critique of the political and economic system that neglects them. He was described as \"the main intellectual force in the Church\" since the mid-1980s. On 11 February 2013, Benedict XVI announced his resignation, citing a \"lack of strength of mind and body\" due to his advanced age. He was the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415 and the first on a pope's initiative since Celestine V in 1294. After the conclave that followed his resignation, Bergoglio was elected to the office of pope on 13 March 2013 and was installed on 13 April 2013. Bergoglio's handling of sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church and opposition to the usage of condoms in areas of high HIV transmission, despite their effectiveness in preventing the spread of HIV, led to substantial criticism from public health officials, anti-AIDS activists, and victims' rights organizations.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1687680}

At that time, along with the parish, Slenaken comprised a handful of houses and farmsteads.   At some point before 1428 a small chapel was constructed.   There is a legend that this was triggered when a shepherd saw  one of his sheep kneeling before a \"cross\" in a burning bush.   This inspired the villagers to build the little chapel, where they came together each Friday to venerate the Holy Cross.   Starting in 1495, the site expanded and became a monastery.\n\nBy 1676 the village was part of the (today Belgian) parish of St. Martens-Voeren.

It was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's SmackDown! brand division. The event took place on May 22, 2005, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe main event was an \"I Quit\" match featuring two wrestlers fighting until one stated \"I Quit.\" WWE Champion John Cena defeated John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) to retain his championship. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In respective standard wrestling matches, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero and Booker T defeated Kurt Angle.\n\nJudgment Day grossed over $500,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 9,500, and received 220,000 pay-per-view buys. This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $4.7 million compared to the previous year.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nJudgment Day was first held by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the 25th In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) in October 1998. It then returned in May 2000 as its own event, establishing Judgment Day as the promotion's annual May PPV. The 2005 event was the seventh event in the Judgment Day chronology and was held on May 22 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Like the previous year's event, it featured wrestlers exclusively from the SmackDown! brand.\n\nStorylines\nThe event featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character. All wrestlers were from the SmackDown! brand\u00a0\u2013 a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being Raw.\n\nThe main event at Judgment Day was between John Cena and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) over the WWE Championship in an \"I Quit\" match. The previous month at WrestleMania 21, Cena defeated JBL to win the WWE Championship. On the April 7 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a series of number one contenders matches, after JBL, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, The Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle all demanded a WWE Championship match. The first match that Long announced was between JBL and Rey Mysterio. Mysterio was disqualified, after Eddie Guerrero interfered and attacked JBL, resulting in JBL winning the match. The following week on SmackDown!, Guerrero and Kurt Angle were scheduled for the second contender's match. Angle advanced to the finals, as he went on to defeat Guerrero. Later during the program, Cena unveiled a spinner version of the WWE championship. Before the unveiling, however, JBL came out wearing the original WWE championship. On the April 21 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T and Big Show were booked in another contenders match. After the match ended in a double disqualification, Long booked JBL, Angle, Booker T, and Big Show in a Fatal Four-Way match for the following week. JBL won the match, after he pinned Angle and having the right to face Cena at Judgment Day for the WWE Championship. On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, Cena proposed that he would defend the championship against JBL in an \"I Quit\" match. Two weeks later, on the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL faced Scotty 2 Hotty, which Scotty won after JBL was disqualified. After the match, however, JBL attacked Scotty and demanded that he say \"I quit.\" JBL further the assault, choking him with a leather belt, Scotty said \"I quit.\" That same night, Cena defeated The Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham) in a handicap match. During the duration of the match, JBL, who was at ringside, yelled at Cena, telling him to say \"I quit.\"\n\nOne of the featured preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. One month prior to Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Mysterio defeated Guerrero. In the weeks that followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Theodore Long booked a Street Fight between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match (which Mysterio won), Chavo, Mercury, and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.\n\nThe other featured preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T in a singles match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Angle, Booker T, Big Show and JBL took part in a Fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship, which JBL won. During the match, Angle hit Booker T with a steel chair to eliminate him. Booker came back and hit Angle with a chair to cause him to be eliminated. The following week, Angle challenged Booker T to a match at Judgment Day, which Booker accepted. Prior to that, Angle had insulted Booker T's wife, Sharmell, which led to Booker T attacking and accepting Angle's challenge. On the May 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle admitted he would like to have \"perverted sex\" with Sharmell. That same night, Angle and Booker T were scheduled in a match, which led to Angle leaving the ring and going backstage to Sharmell. Booker T went backstage and found Sharmell on the floor crying. This led to Angle attacking Booker T from behind and pushing him towards a pair of steel lockers. The following week, Long suspended Angle and demanded that Angle apologize for his actions. Angle apologized, but admitted that he actually kissed Sharmell and let her fondle his \"private parts\" before Booker T made his way to the locker room. Booker T, while watching the interview kicked a television monitor down and broke it.\n\n#1 contender tournament bracket\n\nEvent\n\nBefore the Judgment Day event aired live on pay-per-view, Nunzio defeated Akio in a match that aired on Sunday Night Heat.\n\nPreliminary matches\n\nAfter Sunday Night Heat, the pay-per-view began with a tag team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match and was able to tag in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a Snapshot to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the tag team titles.\n\nThe second wrestling match on the pay-per-view was The Big Show versus Carlito, who was accompanied by Matt Morgan. For the duration of the match, Big Show used his body size to his advantage as he squashed, or easily and quickly performed moves on Carlito. The momentum changed, when Carlito gained control part way through the match. In the end, Big Show accidentally whipped Carlito into the referee. This saw Carlito hit a low blow on Big Show. Carlito won the match and gained the successful pinfall after Morgan delivered an F-5 to Big Show.\n\nThe next match was a standard match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Paul London defended the title against Chavo Guerrero. After back and forth action between the two, London was able to perform a 450\u00b0 splash. London then pinned Guerrero to retain the WWE Cruiserweight title.\n\nThe final preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle into the ring ropes and executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed from the mouth. The match saw exchange offense from both Angle and Booker T. The match came to an end when Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Booker T grabbed Angle's leg and rolled him into a pinfall victory.\n\nMain event matches\n\nThe first featured match was for the WWE United States Championship, where Orlando Jordan defended the title against Heidenreich. As the match began, Jordan was able to perform a dropkick, sending Heidenreich through the ropes to the outside. Heidenreich, however, would gain the advantage after countering Jordan's attack from the top rope into a suplex. Afterwards, Jordan delivered a DDT and pinned Heidenreich to retain the United States title.\n\nThe next match was Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a standard match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when he was able to execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won after Guerrero was disqualified for attacking him with a steel chair.\n\nThe main event was the \"I Quit\" match for the WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena came out on the flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a turntable mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. Cena performed a Back Body Drop through an announce table on JBL. Shortly after, JBL struck Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. JBL performed a Clothesline from Hell on Cena, who later performed an FU on JBL. Later in the match, in the ramp area, Cena threw JBL through a television monitor, causing JBL to bleed. JBL quit as Cena prepared to attacked him with an exhaust pipe, which was from the semi truck, meaning Cena retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Cena struck JBL with the exhaust pipe, causing him to fall through a glass panel that was part of the entrance stage.\n\nReception\nThe Target Center had a maximum capacity of 20,000, which was reduced for the event. This event grossed over $500,000 from an approximate attendance of 9,500, the maximum allowed. It also received 220,000 pay-per-view buys. Judgment Day helped WWE earn $21.6\u00a0million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $16.9\u00a0million the previous year, which was later confirmed by Linda McMahon on September 7, 2005 in a quarterly result. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event a 5 out of 10 stars. The rating was lower than the Judgment Day event in 2006, which was said to be an entertaining pay-per-view to watch. The \"I Quit\" match between John Cena and JBL was rated an eight out of 10 stars. Additionally, the match between Orlando Jordan and Heidenreich was rated a 4 out of 10 stars.\n\nThe event was released on DVD on June 21, 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nAftermath\nOn the June 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, John Cena's SmackDown! tenure came to an end when he became the first wrestler selected by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff in the draft lottery, a mock sports draft lottery in which wrestlers switched programs. Cena immediately entered a staged rivalry with Eric Bischoff after when he refused to participate in Bischoff's \"war\" against the upcoming Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion show. Cena went on to resume his feud with Christian, as they had an encounter at the Royal Rumble in January. During the feud, Chris Jericho was involved as well, as he protested Bischoff's actions of scheduling a WWE championship match between Cena and Christian at Vengeance. After defeating Christian and Tyson Tomko in a tag team match, Jericho betrayed Cena. Convinced with the outcome of the events, Bischoff changed the original match between Christian and Cena to a Triple Threat Match, involving Jericho for the WWE Championship at Vengeance. At the event, Cena retained the WWE Championship.\n\nOn the June 30 episode of SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers for a new top-tier SmackDown! championship was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long announced that he was still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of Raw, Kurt Angle's tenure with SmackDown! came to an end, as he was also drafted to the Raw brand. There, he immediately continued his feud with Shawn Michaels. At the start of the year, Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the January pay-per-view event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to an ankle lock submission hold. The same evening Angle was drafted, Michaels challenged Angle to a WrestleMania 21 rematch at Vengeance, in which Angle accepted. At Vengeance, the rematch saw Michaels defeat Angle.\n\nThe angle between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued. On an episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominik. This led the families of both Guerrero and Mysterio pleading with Guerrero not to reveal the secret. At the Great American Bash, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match where if Guerrero lost, he could not reveal the secret. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero, however, revealed the secret, claiming he was Dominick's scripted biological father. The storyline also went on that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick to be raised by Mysterio's family. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. This led to a Ladder match, a match where the objective was to climb a ladder and reach an object hanging above the ring, between the two for the custody of Dominick at SummerSlam, which Mysterio won.\n\nResults\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n(2005).

The film also stars William R. Moses, Catherine Bell, Vivica A. Fox, and Jeremy Piven. The film was released in the United States on August 22, 2005, and was a box office success, earning $123 million in the United States and $185 million worldwide (from a budget of $75 million) with an additional $80 million in domestic video sales. It received generally negative reviews from critics and was nominated for four Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture. The film is set in the year 2012, primarily in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. A struggling groom-to-be (Steve Mouzakis) receives a phone call on the morning of June 14, 2012, from his future self (Tom Cruise) who is asking him to prevent his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) from boarding a flight to Las Vegas with her friend (Alyssa Milano) the following day. The future self explains that a planet-destroying asteroid will impact Earth in two years, and the only way to stop it is to prevent the birth of a human who will become the Creature, an alien entity that will absorb all human life. The groom-to-be fails to stop the Creature from being born, and the story continues in the present day. The Creature begins its assault on humanity by attacking the White House, and then moves on to attack major cities around the world. The creature is impervious to bullets, and can disguise itself as a member of the human race in order to blend in. It is eventually revealed that the Creature was born from the groom-to-be after he absorbed the life forces of every person on Earth, and that it was the groom-to-be's future self who called him to prevent the birth of the Creature in the first place. The future self explains that he had intended for the Creature to be born, so that it could wipe out humanity and then he would take control of the Creature and use it to bring back humanity in a better form. The plan fails when the Creature becomes too powerful for even the future self to control, and it attacks and destroys the future self. The groom-to-be then uses the last of his strength to send a signal to the Creature, which causes it to freeze and then disintegrate.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16409171}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Go players\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "This article gives an overview of well-known professional and amateur players of the board game Go throughout the ages. The page has been divided into sections based on the era in which the Go players played and the country in which they played. As this was not necessarily their country of birth, a flag of that country precedes every player's name. For a complete list of player articles, see :Category:Go players.\n\nThe important dates that this separation is based on are:\n The establishment of the Four go houses at the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate.\n The demise of the houses in the Meiji Period (end 19th century) followed by their replacement by the Nihon Kiin in 1924.\n The start of international tournament Go in 1989\n\nA Japanese census on Go players performed in 2002 estimates that over 24 million people worldwide play Go, most of whom live in Asia. Most of the players listed on this article are professionals, though some top level amateurs have been included. Players famous for achievements outside Go are listed in their own section.\n\nPrior to 17th century \nWei Qi was recorded throughout the history of China. The first record of Wei Qi player was by Mencius.\n\nChina\n\n17th through 19th centuries\nIn the 17th, 18th and 19th century, Go was popular in both Japan (Edo period) and China (period of the Qing Dynasty). In Korea, a Go variant called Sunjang baduk was played.\n\nJapan\nAt the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, four Go academies were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of Godokoro (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed Meijin (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade. Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of Jun-Meijin (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the iemoto system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house Yasui (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named Senkaku (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house Hayashi (\u6797) were named Monnyu (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house Honinbo (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.\n\n*All ranks are professional dan grades unless otherwise noted.\n\nChina\n\n*Players could achieve the level of Guoshou (literally National Hand), which is best in the nation and ranked 1 pin \u54c1.

Guoshou was the normal term used to refer to the promo player while he was alive, whereas Qisheng was used more as posthumous fame. \nThe ranking of players began in West Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE) and formally recognized by the Governments during the North and South Dynasties Period (3rd to 6th century CE). There were 9 ranks called pin \u54c1 in the system, the same as the ranking system for government officials. The lowest rank was 9 pin, then 8 pin, etc. up to 1 pin.

Professional players The professional Go player is the player who has been awarded the professional certification by a professional Go organization. The professional certification is awarded to a player after he/she wins a series of matches against other professional players. The first professional player in history was Meijin, a 17th-century Japanese player. As of 2016, there are approximately 2,000 professional players in the world, the vast majority of whom are resident in East Asia. The top professional players in the world are given the title of 9 dan, which is the highest professional degree. The professional system has five dan grades in total; 1 to 9. The system was revised in 2010, so that players with special titles such as Meijin, Kisei, and Judan are no longer considered to be 9 dan. As of 2016, there are three major organizations that award professional certifications: the Nihon Kiin (Japan), the Chinese Weiqi Association (China), and the Korea Baduk Association (Korea). Amateur players Amateur players are players who are not professional players. The best amateur players in the world are given the title of 9 dan by the International Go Federation (IGF). There are many amateur players who are stronger than professional players. However, since the professional system is usually closed to international players, the number of professional players is small. Women This is a list of the world's top female Go players.

The pandemic was characterized as a potential \"extinction event\" for journalism as hundreds of news outlets closed and journalists were laid off around the world, advertising budgets were slashed, and many were forced to rethink how to do their jobs amid restrictions on movement and limited access to information or public officials. Journalists and media organizations have had to address new challenges, including figuring out how to do their jobs safely and how to navigate increased repression and censorship brought on by the response to the pandemic, with freelancers facing additional difficulties in countries where press cards or official designations limit who can be considered a journalist.\n\nJournalists have worked to produce coverage of the pandemic combating misinformation, providing public health updates, and supplying entertainment to help people cope with the virus's impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has also enabled citizen journalism to a small extent, for example, through the CoronaReport digital journalism project, \"a citizen science project which democratizes the reporting on the Coronavirus, and makes these reports accessible to other citizens.\" The long duration of the pandemic may have resulted in a COVID-19 information fatigue that could pose a challenge for journalists.\n\nCensorship \nIn some countries \u2013 including Turkey, Egypt, India, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Madagascar, Zambia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Venezuela, Belarus, Montenegro, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Somalia \u2013 journalists have been threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJordanian authorities arrested Roya TV channel's owner, Fares Sayegh, and its news director, Mohamad al-Khalidi, for reporting on lack of jobs and money needed by labourers to feed families during the curfew in mid-April.\n\nOn March 16, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis signed an emergency decree, giving authorities the power to remove, report or close websites spreading \"fake news\" about the COVID-19 pandemic, with no opportunity to appeal.\n\nMyanmar blocked access to 221 news websites, including several leading media outlets.\n\nIn China Caixin has had a number of articles about the source and research COVID-19 pandemic removed from their website after publication.\n\nIn Madagascar, a journalist was arrested and charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina after she criticized the president's handling of the pandemic.\n\nOn May 5, Philippines' National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order against the operations of, ABS-CBN TV network, forcing it to suspend operations for all of its physical broadcasting channels.

According to the 2015 census, the city had 231,107 inhabitants. Its metropolitan area has 381,432 inhabitants and a population density of 29.88 inhabitants per square kilometer. Monclova is the third-largest city and metropolitan area in the state in terms of population, after Torre\u00f3n and Saltillo.\n\nThe city accounts for the highest production of steel of Mexico and Latin America, hence its nickname \"The Steel Capital\".\n\nToday Monclova has one of the highest levels of commercial, industrial, and financial development, and is currently has one of the lowest poverty rates among Mexican cities. Its metropolitan area is among the 10 most competitive urban areas in the country, and it also has one of the highest labor productivity rates.\n\nHistory\nEstablished on July 25, 1577 by Spanish colonists, Monclova became the first city in the region known as Coahuila, which later became the State of Coahuila.\n\nDuring the colonial period and the early 19th century, Monclova served as the capital of Nueva Extremadura. It remained the capital for a few years after Mexico's independence. Prior to 1840, haciendas near Monclova were the headquarters of the S\u00e1nchez Navarro latifundio, the largest private landholding in the Americas.\n\nDuring the initial battle for independence from Spain, fleeing rebel leaders who had been captured at the Wells of Baj\u00e1n were first taken to Monclova before the long trip to the city of Chihuahua. The captured leaders were Juan Aldama, Ignacio Allende, Miguel Hidalgo, and Jose Mariano Jimenez.  \n\nWith the adoption of the 1824 Constitution, which created the state of Coahuila y Tejas, the capital was transferred to Saltillo. In 1828, the decision was overturned when Monclova was declared the capital of the new state, but the state legislature continued to convene in Saltillo. On March 9, 1833, the state legislature settled the dispute in Monclova's favour, and the decision was ratified by President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna on December 2, 1834.\n\nWith the enactment of the 1836 Constitutional Laws, by which the federal republic was converted into a centralised one, the state of Coahuila y Tejas was divided into two departments, Coahuila and Tejas (or Texas, as it would later become). Saltillo was confirmed as Coahuila's capital. However, 1835-36 was also the period of the Texas Revolution, and Texas became an independent republic.\n\nGeography\nMonclova sits at an altitude of 620 m above sea level.

In recent decades the hottest records have climbed as high as  on July 13, 2005 and  on May 4, 1984. However nighttime low temperatures are typically 15 degrees cooler than daytime highs, due to the very arid conditions. Even in July, the warmest month, temperatures have gotten as low as  in 1975. The median temperature July is . A typical summer day has a low around  and a high near . \n\nIn 1976 the wettest month on record took place in July, with  of rain, more than half the median yearly value of  ; however the average wettest month is September with  . The warmer months of the year are typically wetter than the cooler ones. Cold fronts in winter have the possibility of drastically reducing temperatures in the area, and are responsible for the little rainfall of such period.

Precipitation occurs an average of 47 days, out of which 6 will be thunderstorms and at least one day with hail.\n\nEconomy\nThe city accounts for the highest production of steel of Mexico and Latin America, hence its nickname \"The Steel Capital\".

It later passed into the ownership of Farrell's grandson, Norman Hale, and has been used as a cattle ranch ever since. The headquarters is located in Harshaw and includes multiple historic buildings, associated outbuildings, and building foundations.\n\nThe most prominent of these is the James Finley House, a red brick and adobe structure originally used as the office for the Hermosa Mining Company. Because of its unusual construction\u2014red bricks salvaged from a nearby mine\u2014and its association with the early history of Harshaw, the James Finley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nAnother historic home located on the ranch is the Norman Hale Residence, an adobe house with a tin gabled roof, part of which dates back to the 1880s. Nearby is the Mary Hale Residence, another adobe house with a tin hipped roof, built around the same time as the others and locally referred to as the \"Lions Den\". Further down the road is the ruin of a third adobe building that was originally owned by Ignacio \"Nacho\" Arias, who used it as his home and a pool hall.\n\nIn addition to the old houses and outbuildings, there are the foundations of several historic structures. The most notable is that of the Hermosa Mill, which was originally built in the 1870s when mining operations began. Closer to the James Finley House is the concrete foundations of a two-room frame schoolhouse and a Catholic church built of volcanic tuff, both of which were built in the 1940s and torn down in the 1960s. A smaller rock alignment nearby was part of an assay office from the late 19th century.\n\nTwo small cemeteries are also located in the area. The main cemetery to the north of the Hale Ranch headquarters and the townsite is known locally as the \"Mexican cemetery\", because of the many Mexican-American pioneers buried in the cemetery. A short distance away is the \"American cemetery\", which is located on private property and contains the graves of American pioneers, among them Richard Farrell.\n\nA few miles to the east of the Hale Ranch headquarters is another historic ranch house owned by the Hale family. Located along the San Rafael Valley road, the home was originally the headquarters for the Ernest Best Ranch, and was used as a filming location for several Western films. The opening scene of the 1971 made-for-television film \"Wild Rovers\", starring William Holden and Ryan O'Neal, was shot in the living room of the ranch house.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nSee also\n\n San Rafael Ranch\n\nReferences\n\nRanches in Arizona\n1915 establishments in Arizona\nBuildings and structures in Santa Cruz County, Arizona", "machine_text": " Hale Ranch Hale Ranch, originally called the Sanborn Ranch, is a National Historic Landmark in California and is considered the first ranch in the San Francisco Bay Area. The ranch is located in the northern Santa Clara Valley, just south of San Francisco Bay in present-day San Jose. The property is bounded by Los Gatos Creek on the west, Alum Rock Avenue on the south, Highway 87 on the north, and the city of San Jose on the east. The Hale family purchased the 6,000-acre (2,400 ha) ranch in 1868 and expanded it to 7,800 acres (3,200 ha) by the end of the 19th century. The ranch was the largest and most productive in the Santa Clara Valley. The Hale family used the ranch for many purposes, including agriculture, a dairy farm, a nursery, and a ranch for cattle and sheep. In the early 20th century, the ranch was the subject of a dispute between the Hale family and the city of San Jose. The city had plans to build a municipal waterworks on the ranch. The Hales fought the plan in court for many years, eventually winning the right to use the land for agricultural purposes only. The city's plans for the ranch were eventually realized by the mid-1960s with the building of the James Lick Dam and the Alum Rock Park. The Hale family sold the ranch in 1961 to a group of investors who planned to develop it into a residential community called \"Hale Ranch Estates\". However, in the 1970s, most of the land was acquired by the city of San Jose for the formation of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge was created to protect the salt ponds that were a major source of food for migrating birds. Today, the ranch is a mixture of private property and public park land.

His sister Teishi (Sadako) was married to Emperor Ichij\u014d, and Korechika aspired to become the regent (Sessho) for his young brother-in-law after his father's death.  Korechika's (ultimately fruitless) ambitions pitted him against his powerful uncle, Fujiwara no Michinaga, and the resulting power struggle continued until Empress Teishi's unexpected death.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Boles\u0142aw II the Generous\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Boles\u0142aw II the Bold, also known as the Generous ( ; \u015amia\u0142y; c. 1042 \u2013 2 or 3 April 1081 or 1082), was Duke of Poland from 1058 to 1076 and third King of Poland from 1076 to 1079. He was the eldest son of Duke Casimir I the Restorer and Maria Dobroniega of Kiev.\n\nBoles\u0142aw II is considered to have been one of the most capable of the Piast rulers. In 1075 he re-established the Archdiocese of Gniezno (consecrated in 1064) and founded the Diocese of P\u0142ock. He established Benedictine monasteries in Mogilno, Lubin and Wroc\u0142aw. Boles\u0142aw II was also the first Polish monarch to produce his own coinage in quantity great enough to replace the foreign coins prevalent in the country during the reigns of the first Piast kings. He established royal mints in Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw and reformed the coinage, which brought considerable revenue into the royal coffers. All these efforts had an enormous influence on the economic and cultural development of the country.\n\nAccording to the chronicler Gallus Anonymus, during his reign he was called largus (\"the Generous\" in English, \"Szczodry\" in Polish) as he founded many churches and monasteries throughout Poland. The nickname \"the Bold\" (\u015amia\u0142y) was only given to Boles\u0142aw II for the first time in the later Chronicle of the Polish kings, although it was considered by historiography of the 19th and 20th centuries as a contemporary nickname.\n\nDuke of Poland\nFollowing the death of his father Casimir in 1058, Boles\u0142aw II, as the eldest son, inherited Greater and Lesser Poland as well as the Mazovian, Pomerelian, and Silesian lands. His younger brothers W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman and Mieszko became Governors of the remaining provinces. However Mieszko died relatively early, in 1065, at which point his lands came under the authority of Boles\u0142aw II.\n\nHis father had left him a stabilised country; Boles\u0142aw II continued his foreign policy on surrounding his realm with allied kingdoms in order to prevail against the extensive Holy Roman Empire in the west; he aimed to have Poland eventually bordering only allied countries. This is said to be the main reason behind his numerous foreign interventions: in 1060\u20131063 he intervened in Hungary to aid his uncle King B\u00e9la I in the inheritance conflict with his nephew Solomon, who was backed by his brother-in-law King Henry IV of Germany. As a result, B\u00e9la, in 1061, with the support of Polish troops, gained power.\n\nIn Hungary, Boles\u0142aw II pursued the policy of cooperation with the anti-Imperial faction, which allowed him to gain political independence from the Empire but put him in conflict with the Duchy of Bohemia, an Imperial ally. Moreover, he escalated the conflict with the P\u0159emyslid duke Vratislaus II by refusing to pay the annual homage for Silesia and spurring the Bohemian nobility to revolt. In 1063, Boles\u0142aw II unsuccessfully besieged the then-Moravian town of Hradec nad Moravic\u00ed and was forced to retreat. In the end, relations with Vratislaus II were settled to a certain extent when the latter married Princess \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa, Boles\u0142aw II's sister.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1063, King B\u00e9la I of Hungary died. Boles\u0142aw II could not defend the cause of his son G\u00e9za I against the German troops of Henry IV, who finally installed Solomon on the Hungarian throne. In 1069 Grand Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev and his wife Gertruda, Boles\u0142aw's aunt, were overthrown. A Polish military campaign re-established them in power in Kiev.\n\nIn 1071 Boles\u0142aw II attacked Bohemia again. As he refused any attempt at arbitration by King Henry IV, the question was settled by an armistice between the two belligerents; however, Boles\u0142aw II, ignoring the treaty, renewed his attack in 1072 and refused to pay the tributes for Silesia to the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV prepared for a campaign against Poland, but was hit by the outbreak of the Saxon Rebellion in 1073.\n\nDue to his involvement in Hungarian, Bohemian and Kievan affairs, Boles\u0142aw II neglected Poland's interests on the Baltic coast. Therefore, in either 1060 or 1066, Gda\u0144sk Pomerania (Pomerelia) severed its ties to the Polish Kingdom.\n\nKing of Poland\nWhen Hildebrand of Sovana, an enemy of the German king, became Pope Gregory VII in 1073, Boles\u0142aw II saw in him a natural ally; he started to apply the Pope's reforms in the Archbishopric of Gniezno and commenced negotiations to obtain the royal crown. He spurred the ongoing revolt in Saxony, which had forced Henry IV to retreat from that region (he crushed the revolt at the Battle of Langensalza soon thereafter); the Polish king seized the occasion to launch an invasion against Henry IV's vassal, Vratislaus II of Bohemia, alongside an ally from Grand Prince Vladimir II Monomakh of Kiev.\n\nThanks to his support of the papal cause during the investiture controversy in the Holy Roman Empire, Boles\u0142aw II gained the royal crown of Poland: on Christmas Day of 1076 Archbishop Bogumi\u0142 crowned him in the Gniezno Cathedral in the presence of a papal legate. King Henry's IV act of contrition at the Walk to Canossa in 1077 included also the imperial recognition of Boles\u0142aw II's royal title. Boles\u0142aw's new authority, along with his pride, however, caused the Polish magnates to rebel, as they feared the monarchy had started to grow too powerful.\n\nDeposition and death\nIn 1077 Boles\u0142aw II's troops helped two pretenders to assume the throne: Ladislaus I of Hungary, another son of B\u00e9la I, and again Iziaslav in Kiev. In 1078, while returning from the latter campaign, the Polish troops conquered Red Ruthenia. In 1079, however, the conflict with the Polish nobles culminated into open revolt and Boles\u0142aw was deposed and banished from the country. The circumstances that led to the King's banishment hinge on the person of Bishop Stanislaus of Krak\u00f3w, who had excommunicated the king for his infidelity.\n\nFrom historical records it appears that Bishop Stanislaus was involved with the barons' opposition movement, plotting to remove the King and to place his brother W\u0142adys\u0142aw Herman on the throne. Boles\u0142aw II unilaterally declared Stanislaus guilty of treason \u2013 Gallus Anonymus uses the word \"traditor\" meaning traitor. The historical record was first proposed by Master Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek, writing nearly 100 years after Gallus Anonymus and a century and a half after the actual affair.  Boles\u0142aw II on 11 April 1079 assaulted and then personally wielded the sword that murdered Bishop Stanislaus of Krak\u00f3w during the celebration of a Mass. Though the bishop had privately and then publicly warned the king to repent of adultery and other vices, Boles\u0142aw chose a course of action more characteristic of his nickname, \"the Bold\".\n\nHe found refuge at the court of King Ladislaus, who also owed his crown to the deposed king. However, according to Gallus Anonymus, Boles\u0142aw II's atrocious conduct towards his Hungarian hosts caused his premature death in 1081 or 1082 at the hands of an assassin, probably by poisoning. He was about 40 years old.\n\nOssiach legend\nA popular legend holds that Boles\u0142aw proceeded to Rome to beg forgiveness from Pope Gregory, who imposed on him to wander incognito as a mute repentant. On a summer evening in 1082, he reached the Benedictine Abbey at Ossiach in Carinthia, where he was received and did all kind of hard work until he finally was reconciled in the Sacrament of Penance and died.\n\nAt the walls of Ossiach, there exists a tomb bearing the depiction of a horse and the inscription Rex Boleslaus Polonie occisor sancti Stanislai Epi Cracoviensis (\"Boles\u0142aw, King of Poland, murderer of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w\"). In 1960, at the direction of Countess Karolina Lanckoro\u0144ska, the tomb was opened and indeed revealed male bones and the remains of a Polish knight's armor dating from the 11th century.\n\nThe legend, however, dates from centuries after the king's death (it was first mentioned by the chronicler Maciej Miechowita in 1499). His burial place actually remains unknown. Another popular hypothesis about the fate of his remains claims that in 1086 they were transferred to the Benedictine abbey of Tyniec near Krak\u00f3w.\n\nMarriage and issue\nBefore 1069 Boles\u0142aw II married Wyszes\u0142awa (d. aft. 1089), who, according to the Chronicle of Jan D\u0142ugosz (and supported by some sources), was a daughter of Grand Prince Sviatoslav II of Kiev by his first wife Kilikia, possibly a member of the House of Dithmarschen. They had one son, Mieszko (1069 \u2013 1089).\n\nModern historians, led by Oswald Balzer (in 1895), refuted the Kievan origin and name of Boles\u0142aw II's wife and expounded the theory that his wife was the queen named Agnes whose obituary is recorded in Zwiefalten. She may have belonged to the P\u0159emyslid dynasty.\n\nReferences\n\n1040s births\n1080s deaths\n11th-century Polish monarchs\nDukes of Wroc\u0142aw\nPeople of Byzantine descent", "machine_text": " Boles\u0142aw II the Generous (Polish: Boles\u0142aw II Szalchua, Old Polish: Borislaw II Szalkhuwa, Russian: \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 II \u0422\u0440\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438, Boleslaw II Tywysocki, c. 1085 \u2013 2/3 June 1159), a member of the House of Piast, was Duke of Poland and Duke ofSZALCHUA (or SZALKUWA) from 1102 until his death. Boles\u0142aw was the eldest son of Duke Casimir I of Poland by his wife Christina Ingerbrit, daughter of King Inge I of Sweden. He was born in 1085, though according to some historians, he was born around 1043. After the death of his father in 1095, Boles\u0142aw II succeeded in the Duchy of Poland, which he ruled jointly with his younger brothers, Mieszko and Boles\u0142aw the Tall. Their mother, Christina, ruled as Dowager Duchess until her death in 1112. Like his father, Boles\u0142aw was involved in the power struggles of the region. He was defeated by his uncle, Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman of Masuria, who killed Boles\u0142aw's brother Mieszko in the Battle of Giecz in 1105. Soon afterwards, Boles\u0142aw was able to reconquer his brother's inheritance. In 1118, Boles\u0142aw took part in the Battle of Nisko against Duke Boles\u0142aw I the Tall. He was defeated and captured by the latter, who forced him to renounce his claims to the Polish throne. Soon afterwards, Boles\u0142aw was released from prison. He then joined the 1120 Battle of Kietlicz against Duke Henry V of Germany, who was allies with Boles\u0142aw I the Tall. He was again defeated and captured by the Duke of Germany, who this time did not release him. After the death of Boles\u0142aw I the Tall in 1138, Boles\u0142aw II again tried to reclaim his inheritance. He probably took part in the Battle of the Dnieper against the Cumans in 1141, when his uncle, Duke Casimir I of Opole, was killed. In 1146, Boles\u0142aw joined the Grand Prince of Kiev, Iziaslav II, in his war against the Cumans. In 1150, Boles\u0142aw gave his territories to his younger brother, Henry, and then went to the court of the Grand Prince of Kiev, where he spent the last years of his life. He was buried in the Pochayiv Monastery, in present-day Ukraine. Boles\u0142aw II was married to Salomea, a daughter of Duke Casimir I of Opole. They had four children: 1.

The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.\n\nCase\n\nHarkins and Cooper\nOn August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.\n\nOn October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \"homicidal violence,\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.\n\nRiemer and Robertson\n\nOver a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \"Mommy was in the trees.\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \"not nearly verbal enough\" to provide any information.\n\nPolice searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.\n\nIn the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \"I love you, Diana.\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.\n\nDue to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.\n\nIn February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle\u2019s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\"\n\n2011 development\nOn March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nMedia depiction\nIn September 1989, the case was featured by the series Unsolved Mysteries.\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\nList of serial killers in the United States\nList of solved missing person cases\nList of unsolved murders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAudio segment on The Trail Went Cold podcast\nCase profile at unsolved.com\nMichael Lloyd Riemer at Find a Grave\nDiana Robertson at Find a Grave\n\n1980s missing person cases\n1985 in Washington (state)\n1985 murders in the United States\nAugust 1985 events in the United States\nDecember 1985 events in the United States\nAugust 1985 crimes\nDecember 1985 crimes\nAmerican murder victims\nCouples\nCrimes in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nDeaths by stabbing in the United States\nFormerly missing people\nFugitives\nMissing person cases in Washington (state)\nMurder in Washington (state)\nPeople murdered in Washington (state)\nSerial murders in the United States\nUnidentified serial killers\nUnsolved murders in the United States", "machine_text": " Mineral, Washington murders On November 11, 2022, three people were murdered and two injured in Mineral, Washington, a small community about 70 miles (110 km) south of Seattle.

He was probably born in the family's London residence, as his father became active in the woolen cloth trade in the city between 1605 and 1610. His older half-brother, also named Anthony, was born in 1598 in Hampshire, and may have died in 1622. The younger Anthony was educated at the College of St. John the Baptist at Winchester, where he was admitted in 1620, and at St. Paul's School, London, where he was admitted in 1621. He was admitted to the Society of Jesus in April 1625 at the age of 19, and entered the novitiate at the Jesuit College in St. Omer, Artois, France, where he studied the classics, philosophy, and theology. After a year at St. Omer, Winchester was sent to Rome to continue his studies at the Jesuit Collegium Romanum. While there, he was influenced by the Italian Jesuit Giovanni Battista Scarano, who later became the Superior General of the Society of Jesus. From Rome, Winchester was sent to England in April 1630, and then to the College of St. Peter at Xavier, in Leuven, Belgium, where he studied theology and law. He was ordained a priest on 7 June 1632, and then sent to the College of St. Andrew at Fiesole, Italy, where he was appointed Spiritual Father and novice master. ## Mission to Maryland In January 1634, Winchester was one of the three Jesuits who accompanied Father Andrew White to the Maryland colony. The other two were Father John Altham and Father Thomas Copley. They arrived at St. Mary's City on 25 November 1633, and were met by the first Governor, William Claiborne, who was not a Catholic. The capital was a small settlement on the north shore of the Potomac River, about five miles from its outlet into the Chesapeake Bay. The Catholic priests were sent to the colony to minister to the small number of Catholics, and to convert the English, American Indians, and African slaves who were in the colony. While there, he ministered to the Catholic community at St. Mary's City and the surrounding area, and converted several members of the Piscataway tribe. When William Claiborne died in 1634, the Maryland Council elected Winchester as the third colonial governor. As a priest, he was not permitted to serve as governor, so he resigned the office. However, he was elected to the Maryland Council, and served as a member from 1634 to 1635. He was also one of the original trustees of St. Mary's City. In 1635, Winchester returned to England, where he was appointed Spiritual Father at the Jesuit residence in London. He was also a frequent visitor at the court of Charles I, and served as a royal chaplain. He was a friend of the Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria, who was influential in getting her husband to issue the Charter of Maryland in 1634. When the English Civil War began in 1641, Winchester was serving as the Superior of the Jesuits in the West of England. He was confined in the Tower of London in 1643, but later released. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Winchester was appointed Superior of the Jesuits in the South of England, based at the Jesuit college in Salisbury, Wiltshire. He was also one of the first trustees of the Maryland Colony when the royal charter was restored in 1661. ## Later life In 1666, Winchester was appointed Superior of the Jesuits in the West of England for a second time. He died in 1683 at the College of St. James in Bristol, and was buried at St. Mary's on the Quay in Bristol. ## Legacy In the early 21st century, the house built by Anthony Winchester in St. Mary's City, Maryland, in the early 17th century, was the oldest surviving building in Maryland. The house was used as a residence, as a tobacco warehouse, and as a hospital during the Second World War. It was located on the corner of Duke of Gloucester and Charles streets, and was known as the \"Harman House\" after its 20th-century owner, Mary L. Harman. The house was torn down in 1958 to make way for the construction of a new post office. In 2010, the house was rebuilt by the Historic St. Mary's City Commission, using the same construction methods and materials that would have been used in the 17th century.

He directed the company until 1821, when he relocated to Munich to take an appointment as Court Ballet Master. The following year, his ballet company was disbanded, by Imperial order, as the result of a scandal involving Prince Aloys von Kaunitz-Rietberg, who was accused of molesting almost two hundred underage girls, most of whom were  in the company.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (Kenya)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In 1977 the Board of Governors of the World Bank approved Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project (BISP) in Kenya. The project area is situated just South of the Equator in the Lower Tana Basin. It lies on the west bank of the Tana River and falls within the administrative area of Tana River County. \nThe project was an ambitious attempt of the government of Kenya, the World Bank and a few other donors to develop a remote area, create employment for thousands of people with a reasonable income and earn foreign exchange.  Bura project would develop about 6,700 net irrigated ha over a 5 \u00bd year period and settle on smallholdings about 5,150 landless poor families selected from all parts of Kenya. Physical and social infrastructure would be provided to support the settler and satellite population, expected to reach a total of 65,000 persons by 1985. The total cost of the project was estimated at 92 million dollars in 1977 prices.\nActual construction started in 1978. During implementation the costs exploded from $17,500/= per family to $55,000/=, a new record for the World Bank. The largest cost increase was for the irrigation network (615%). The donors were not willing and the government was not able to raise the additional funds and subsequently the size of the project was scaled down from 6,700 ha to 3,900 and later to 2,500 ha, although the irrigation structures were completed for 6,700 ha. In this period 2,100 landless households from all over Kenya were settled in the scheme. They were allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year they were to grow 1.25 ha cotton and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas.\nSoon it was evident that the project would fail to achieve its objectives. Job creation was only 40% of the target, the economic rate of return was negative and the annual operating and maintenance costs exceeded the benefits. Even with net farm incomes of about 40% of the appraisal estimates in real terms, annual government subsidies amounted to about 1,000 dollars per settler. The project had an unreliable water supply and many buildings had foundation problems.\nAfter cotton crop failures due to pests in 1990 the project came virtually to a standstill as the management lacked the funds to finance cotton and maize crops. Most settlers deserted and the only the ones with nowhere to go remained in the scheme, living on famine relief and odd jobs. \nIn the period 1993-2005 a number of times the government tried to revive a number of timesthe project, but all in vain. After 2005, rehabilitation and crop growing started in phases and since 2009-10 the tenants have been growing crops, although the cropping pattern comed down to no more than 50% of the projected crop intensity and the settlers have low incomes, if any. This is partly caused by the fact that the original cash crop, cotton, is no longer a profitable crop.\n\nBackground\n\nDuring the later 1930s and 1940s the colonial government was already concerned about population pressure and soil erosion. Irrigation was seen as a means to reduce land pressure and the Tana River Basin was seen as the natural area to start irrigated settlements. As early as 1934 Harris and Sampson published their \u2018Report on the Tana River Expedition\u2019. In 1948 the colonial government published a study on two 40,000 ha schemes between Bura and Grand Falls. Due to the remoteness and poor soils these projects were uneconomic. In 1956 the government started Hola Pilot Irrigation Project about 40\u00a0km south of Bura.\nFrom 1963 to 1967 the FAO oversaw the Lower Tana River Basin study. This study was carried out by Ilaco and Acres (two engineering firms) and they proposed to start an irrigation project of minimally 100,000 ha. However, with an economic rate of return of 10% the study showed that the project was economically marginal. One recommendation was to start a research and training centre. Later it was decided that this centre should be a pilot project at Bura and Ilaco was given a contract to carry out a feasibility study. That study, as was the case with most Ilaco studies, was financed by the Netherlands.\n\nStudies and appraisal\n\nIlaco feasibility studies\nIn 1973 Ilaco presented its first feasibility study on Bura. It proposed to develop 4,000 ha for 3,000 tenants. The economic rate of return was calculated at 13.5%. In the meantime feasibility studies in other areas in Kenya had shown disappointed rate of returns for irrigation projects and the Government of Kenya, therefore, proposed that Ilaco makes an even more detailed study for 14,000 ha so that a project that was eligible for financing by the World Bank could be produced. In 1975 Ilaco submitted its report. This report became the basis of the project that eventually materialized. This study envisaged the settlement of 11,000 families on 14,000 ha. The implementation period would take 11 \u00bd years and the economic rate of return was calculated at 16%. Although the report raised some questions about the quality of the soils, the Ilaco feasibility study was optimistic and foresaw a bright future for the area.\n\nAppraisal by the World Bank\nLate 1975 a World Bank appraisal mission visited Kenya and in June 1976 the first appraisal report (White Cover) was presented. The document proposed a 14,000 ha project with an economic rate of return of 11%. Internally the World Bank had classified Bura as a \"potential difficult and contentious project\" because of the level of external financing, incomplete preparation, high cost per family, cost recovery, remote area and settler selection. Interesting enough the soils were not seen as a problem, but a few months after the publication of the White Cover report this issue erupted, when World Bank staff reviewed the details of the soil studies and concluded that the classification of these soils by Ilaco was too optimistic and not justified.\n\nWith the appraisal on the verge of collapse, a phased development programme was proposed. Phase I consisted of a project of 6,700 ha with mainly good soils, but also with poorer soils (31%) in order to gain practical experiences with these soils. If the poorer soils proved to have potential, then phase II of about 6,000 ha with poorer soils would be developed. At this moment the World Bank also introduced Stage II, which was for about 25,000 ha irrigation development on the east bank of the Tana River.\nUnder normal circumstances the consultants who prepared the feasibility study and the designs would automatically be engaged to supervise the construction. However, the World Bank was not satisfied with the work of Ilaco and insisted on tendering for the position of project consultants. In December 1976 a British consortium, Sir M. MacDonald and Partners and Associated Firms was appointed. Part of the job of the firm was to prepare an implementation report (Project Planning Report), review the Ilaco studies, reformulate the project at a reduced scale and provide essential data to the appraisal report. Indeed, the new consultants confirmed the cost estimates given by the World Bank.\n\nThe new proposal envisaged 6,700 ha irrigated land for 5,150 landless families from all parts of Kenya. The plan was to construct a diversion structure on the Tana River 46\u00a0km above the project. A principal town and 23 villages were to be built along with education, social and administrative facilities and the physical infrastructure (roads, water, electricity) for a population of 65,000 people. Settlers were allocated tenancies of 1,3 ha of which 1,25 ha were for field crops and 0,05 for garden vegetables. An ingenious cropping pattern would make it possible for the tenants to grow 1,25 ha cotton and 0,625 ha maize intercropped with cow peas each year. The total cost of the project was US $91,7 m (Kshs 766 m). Financiers were the IBRD (US $34m), IDA (US $ 6m), EDF (US $12m), Netherlands (US $8,8m), ODM (US$8,5m) and CDC (US $8,5m). The remaining US $20,6 m was to be financed by Kenya. The tenants were to earn Kshs 7,000 (US $840) yearly and the economic rate of return was calculated at 13%.\n\nThe National Irrigation Board (NIB) would be overall responsible for the implementation of the project. However, the World Bank argued that its experience and implementation capacity was limited and therefore experienced consultants should be employed to complete the design, supervise the construction and assist in coordination of all activities.\n\nProject Planning Report \nIn September 1977, after many delays the new consultants submitted part of the six volumes comprising Project Planning Report (PPR). Even though the consortium had confirmed the World Bank estimates (based on the Ilaco studies) before the appraisal report was published, MacDonald and partners gave a total cost of US $112,1m (Kshs936 m), an increase of 22%. The cost increase was largely due to much higher consultancy cost and, to a lesser extent, the irrigation works. This surprised, if not shocked, Kenya and the other financiers. Two months after the appraisal, the project was thus already seriously underfunded. Surprisingly, despite the higher cost, the economic rate of return of the project remained at 13%.\n\nOne feature of the Project Planning Report was that it linked the implementation of Stages I and II. For instance, the river diversion structure was to be redesigned so that it could serve both Stages. This despite the fact that there existed very little evidence that Stage II could be a viable project.\n\nComparison of key documents\n\nA comparison of the unit costs from 1975-1977 gives the following:\n\nIn its studies Ilaco argued that a cost increase of 10% would lower the economic rate of return with one percentage point. As the table above shows, however, cost increases of 600% resulted only in a minor change of the economic rate of return. The following parameters were changed to keep the economic rate of return, despite huge cost increases, at an acceptable level:\n Shadow pricing of the Kshs at a value of 11 Kshs as compared with the official dollar rate at that time of 8.35.\n Shortening the implementation period. \n Huge increases in the yield of the main crops in the early years even though there was no new evidence that could justify such increases.\n Defining a number of investment cost as non-project and hence excluding them, at least partly, from the cost benefit analysis. For instance, the World Bank defined only 75% of the social infrastructure as project costs. \n Many other, often minor changes, which almost always resulted in a higher rate of return.\n\nIn the PPR, apart from changing other parameters, the consultant introduced a completely new method of retaining the rate of return of the project at an acceptable level by apportioning investments to Stage I, phase II and Stage II. By claiming, for instance, that the river diversion works could serve an area of 37 000 on both the east and the west bank, it attributed only 6,700 ha (18%) to Stage I, phase I. At various places it has been pointed out that there existed no methodological justification for this way of calculating the internal rate of return. If phase II and Stage II would ever be implemented, then the remaining 82% of the cost of the diversion weir would have been defined as sunk cost and also not be included in the cost benefit analysis. By excluding them now, these costs would never be included in any cost benefit analysis.\n\nImplementation\n\nMajor design changes\nWhereas the formal agreements between Kenya and the World Bank were signed in June 1977 the implementation was delayed due to a number of factors. Firstly Kenya and the consultants needed about 10 months before they could agree on a new consultancy contract. The outcome of these negotiations was that the consultancy cost almost doubled. Secondly, during the preparation of the final designs, major modifications were made by the consultants on both the intake and the irrigation structure. These changes caused not only new delays, but also, for instance, an increase of concrete structures in the main canal with 138%, stone pitching with 338% and digging with 255%. In 1979 the World Bank concluded that both the original design of Ilaco and MacDonald\u2019s design were based on sound engineering principles. Rejection of the new design would have resulted in further delays and fearing further delays the World Bank accepted the new design. According to the World Bank, however, design changes would result in a cost increase of 65% in real terms. At that time the economic rate of return of the project was at best 4%. \nAlso one of the financiers (CDC) withdrew and as a result of this the part to be financed by Kenya, depending on the project formulation, increased to between 50 and 65% in real terms of the total project cost.\n\nConstruction\n\nProject construction began in mid 1979, two years late, and by mid 1982 construction was about three years behind schedule. During construction the cost continued to escalate and in September 1982 the Bank calculated an increase of 87% for the base cost. If the cost increases due to delays were included, the total cost had at least trebled. Huge cost increases were registered for the construction the tenant houses and the domestic waste supply. At the same time studies on the quality of the soils on the East Bank showed that these soils were so poor that further investigations were no longer justified and the idea of a stage II was shelved.\n\nFinancial crises\nIn this period the local inflation rate climbed and this was accompanied by a fall in the value of the Kenyan Shilling. Together with the cost escalation, the part which Kenya had to finance grew bigger and bigger and this alarmed the government. A few new donors (Finnida and the World Food Programme) committed funds, but these funds amounted only to a few million dollars. Also OPEC and Kuwait committed funds for the intake and the ginnery, but since their funding financed only part of these components, these funds did not solve the crisis but would actually increase it. Subsequently, a special government committee was established to control the cost. The committee advised, following earlier advice from the consultants, to postpone and later to cancel the river intake structure. A temporary pumping station designed to operate for a few years, pending the completion of the river works, would become permanent. Other project components, e.g. the ginnery, were also cancelled. To further reduce the cost, the quantity and quality of the houses and roads was reduced. The forest component of the project was drastically trimmed down from 3,900 ha to 650 ha. All the cost saving measures still did not reduce the financial burden for the government of Kenya to an acceptable level and the government decided to reduce the project area to 3,900ha and later to 2,500ha. After these decisions the Bura project still took about 40% yearly of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nEspecially the decision to cancel the river works was later criticised as this would jeopardise the supply of water to the project. However, in 1979 the consultants had calculated that a project with a pumping station would have a much lower capital cost and, subsequently, a much higher rate of return than a project with a gravity intake. The implicit recommendation was that a gravity intake was not only very costly, but also unnecessary. This conclusion was embraced by the government and subsequently it shelved the gravity intake. However, there was serious catch in this, which was not included in the analysis of the consultant: the high, projected yields of cotton and maize were partly based on the fact that the project had a gravity and thus a secure supply of irrigation water. Therefore, when calculating the rate of return for the project with a pumping station the consultants should have used lower yields for cotton and maize in their economic analysis. They did not do this and in this way they got the advantages of both gravity (higher yields) and pumping (low investment costs).\n\nProject completion\nThe final project consisted of 2,500 ha and some parts were done for more than 75% (water supply, irrigation network, supply, main and branch canals and the NIB offices). Other parts were done for about 1/3 (primary schools, health facilities, tenant houses). Important components as the cotton ginnery, river diversion structure, feasibility study East Bank, housing for teachers, social halls and the 132 KV transmission line were not implemented. Despite all the omissions and reductions the final cost of the project was estimated by the World Bank at 105 million dollars or 1,180 million Kshs. With a cost of Kshs 472,000 ($55,000) per ha the project became a new high for the World Bank. The World Bank considered the project completed in 1988.\n\nSunk cost\nDuring the financial crises economic reviews were published regularly. In all economic reviews an acceptable economic rate of return and thus, in the eyes of the reviewers, a viable project, was presented to the financiers based on sunk-costs principles, that is to say that already invested funds and commitments were excluded from the cost-benefit analysis. Such an analysis, however, easily disguises serious underlying problems. In the case of Bura all the reviews showed also that after the investment period, the project would still need a considerable annual subsidy from the government. In the most thorough and realistic review this subsidy was calculated at about Ksh20 million. The project was also very sensitive to changes in the project cost and yields. The same study also showed that the close-down of the project was possible for a one-off amount of Ksh 40 million. For different reasons the various parties never saw closing down the project as an option.\n\nSettlement of tenants\nWhile priority was given to local inhabitants, tenants for Bura were drawn from all parts of Kenya. They had to meet the following criteria: heads of households must be aged between 25 and 45 years and preferably married, must be landless, unemployed or underemployed or earn an income below the minimum agricultural wage, must be medically and physically fit, must provide the equivalent of four adult labour units, must be of good character and should have a rural or farming background. Late 1981 the first group of about 330 settlers arrived and by mid 1984 the total number of tenants living in the scheme was 1,802. They came from Coast Province (35%), Central (24%), Eastern (13%), Nyanza (8%), Western (8%), Rift Valley (6%) and others (6%). In 1988 the number of tenants was estimated at 2,139. Life at Bura was difficult for the tenants and desertion rates in the period 1981-1984 were estimated at between 20-30%.\n\nThe NIB provided the tenants with housing, transport, food, tools and a subsistence advance of Kshs 300 per month for incoming tenants until the first cash crop was harvested. The tenants repaid this advance over a period of three years. When the tenants arrived, often the farm land was not ready and this resulted in late planting, low cotton yields and thus low incomes.\n\nProduction\n\nEarly years\nFrom 1977 till 1985 the project was governed by the National Irrigation Board (NIB). During this period the World Bank and other donors had a low opinion of the NIB's management of Bura and their pressure resulted into a transfer of the project from the NIB to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development in 1985. After 1989 it was transferred to other ministries. and in 2005 it was reverted to the NIB. When Bura resorted under ministries as a kind of semi-independent department, usually the NIB fell also under this ministry. The main difference was that the NIB had a parastatal status and Bura Project lacked this protection. Hence whenever Bura moved to a new ministry, it had to fight for accounting privileges as a \u2018production\u2019 unit. The existing accounting procedures within ministries were rarely conducive for a smooth operation of the production unit Bura, .\n\nEvery tenant was allocated two plots of 0.625 ha and a garden of 0.05 ha. Each year the tenants were to grow 1.25 ha cotton (main season) and 0.625 maize intercropped with cowpeas (off-season). After the fourth year 0.2 ha of the maize would be replaced with the much more profitable groundnuts. The cropping pattern of 148% was very tight as together the maize and cotton crops needed almost a year in the field and thus there was very little time left for land preparation. To solve this problem an ingenious cropping system was developed in which each tenant had two plots. On one plot he would plant early cotton (1 February) and after harvesting the cotton he would plant maize and harvest maize. Next year, this plot will then be ready for late cotton (March-early April). After the late cotton is harvested, there will be enough time to prepare the land for the early cotton. The second plot would start with late cotton, then early cotton, maize and again late cotton. Planting cotton after early April not only results in low yields but also disrupts the whole cropping calendar. In practice this cropping pattern lacked flexibility and planting periods for cotton of four months occurred. A comparison of the projected yield and the actual production figures for cotton and maize is given in the tables below:\n\nComparison of projected cotton yield with actual yields \n\n All projections are derived from the World Bank appraisal report 1977.\n Tenants were to harvest 2,500\u00a0kg in their first year, 2,600\u00a0kg in their second, 2,700 in their third, 2,800\u00a0kg in their fourth, 2,900\u00a0kg in their fifth and after 3,000\u00a0kg. Many settlers grew their first cotton crop in this year and started thus with a yield of 2,500. This resulted in the same average projection as in the previous year.\n Pest problems.\n In this cropping season there was a serious water problem.\n Good water, but very serious pest problems.\n No cotton was grown due to the collapse of the scheme (see below).\n\nComparison of projected maize yield with actual yields\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width: 65pt;\" | Year\n| style=\"width: 100pt;\" | WB projection in tonnes 1977 \n| style=\"width: 100pt;\" | Actual production in tonnes\n| style=\"width: 85pt;\" | WB projected yield per ha (kg) | style=\"width: 85pt;\" | Actual yield per ha (kg)'|-\n| 1979 || 810 ||0 ||0||0\n|-\n| 1980 || 2,890 ||0 ||0||0\n|-\n|  1981 || 5,900 ||560 || 2,000||2,800 \n|-\n|  1982 || 7,700 || 1,736 || 2,300||3,100\n|-\n| 1983 ||  8,300|| 1,840 || 2,300 ||2,300 \n|-\n| 1984 || 8,410 || 1,870 || 2,500||1,700\n|-\n| 1985 || 8,550 || 2,040 ||2,850||1,700\n|-\n| 1986 || 8,480 || 850 || 3,400||1,700\n|-\n| 1987 || 8,150 || 1,700 || 3,600||1,700\n|-\n| 1988 || 7,780|| no figures || 3,700||no figures\n|-\n| 1989 || 7,620 || 1,942|| 3,700||1,500\n|-\n| 1990  || 7620 || 0 ||3,700||0\n|-\n| 1991  || 7,620 || 216 || 3,700||1,080\n|-\n| 1992 || 7,620 || 216 || 3,700|| 1,080\n|-\n| 1993  || 7,620 || 0 || 3,700||0\n|-\n| 1994-2005  || 7,620 || 0 || 3,700||0\n|}\n All projections are derived from the World Bank appraisal report 1977.\n Maize was supposed to be intercropped with cowpeas, and this would increase the value of the 'maize' harvest with 50%. The planting of cowpeas never materialized. It was also planned that the tenants would grow groundnuts, a high value crop, but this turned out not to be possible. This implies that the projected maize figures should be 50% higher to make them fully comparable with the actual yields.\n Contrary to the cotton records, the maize production figures are considered to be unreliable. This applies certainly to the 1982 and 1983 statistics, but even the figures for the years after 1983 are considered to be inflated. Vainio-Matilla estimates the yields per ha of most farmers below 600\u00a0kg/ha \n Tenants were to harvest 2,000\u00a0kg in their first year, 2,500\u00a0kg in their second, 2,800\u00a0kg in their third, 3,100\u00a0kg in their fourth, 3,400\u00a0kg in their fifth and in their sixth and after 3,700\u00a0kg. Many new settlers arrived in this period and they grew their first maize crop in this year and started thus with a yield of 2,000\u00a0kg. This resulted in the same average projection as the previous year.\n In 1989 the cropping pattern at Bura was in disarray and in order to reorganize planting, one maize crop was skipped.\n In this maize season there was a serious water problem.\n All government funds were frozen.\n The project had collapsed (see below) and no maize was grown.\n\nAs the tables show the production in the project was very disappointing. If it is taken into account that no cowpeas and groundnuts have been planted, the picture becomes even worse. A mid-term review in 1985 projected a cash income for the tenants between Kshs 5,000 and 6,000 for the year 1984. For the years after 1985 it calculated an income of Kshs 7,400 (55% of the appraisal estimate in real terms) if the cotton yield would be 2,500\u00a0kg. With an average yield of 2,005 for the years 1982-1989, the cash income would have been about Kshs 5,620 or almost 40% of the appraisal estimate.\nIn 1986 75% of the tenants received a cash income and 25% nothing. In 1989 only 35% of the tenants received a cash income and following year only 20% of the tenants received an cash income. After 1992 no production took place and the tenants no longer received any cash income.\n\nThus, tenant incomes have been disappointing, but it is doubtful whether incomes would have been better with higher yields, as a trade-off exist between the tenant incomes and the annual loss that the project makes. In 1990, the World Bank pointed out that the project made an annual loss of Kshs 17,000 per settler. If the project wanted to be financially viable, then the tenants were expected to pay this annual loss through their service charges. At Bura, the tenants paid Kshs 3,000 per settler, but to reach a break-even point, the tenants should have paid a much higher amount, meaning that tenants would not earn any income. The project management finds itself in a balancing act that on the one hand it has to keep the charges at such a level that the tenants do not lose interest in farming, whereas at the same time it needs to keep the annual loss on its operations as low as possible. In the beginning the project got adequate government support to take care of the losses, although a side effect was that the operation and maintenance of the project suffered. Later the government support was reduced.\n\nAfforestation and the spread of Prosopis\n\nIn order to avoid the destruction of the riverine forest and other environmental damage in Bura, a plantation programme was included in the BISP. The World Bank estimated that 3,900 ha forest would be necessary. It calculated that the cost of irrigating would be low, as surplus water would be used. In the early nineties the area was scaled down to 600 ha. In 1983 the NIB forester established a plot of 10 ha with Prosopis. Later this plot was the main source of seeds for other treeplanting activities and for natural regeneration of \u2018wild\u2019 Prosopis.\n\nAfter establishment of the forest plots, Prosopis spread vigorously outside the plantations. Animals ate the pods and moved around the scheme dispersing the seeds in their droppings. Whenever water was available, seeds in the droppings germinated readily and within a few years almost all canal sides in Bura were occupied by this fast growing shrub. This \u2018wild\u2019 Prosopis, in Tana River County popularly known as Mathenge, did not limit itself to the canal banks and it also blossomed along roads, in the fields and villages. \nBy 1991, Prosopis had solved the fuelwood problem and tenants even earned income by burning charcoal. The pods were used as animal food and wind erosion in the area was reduced. Unfortunately eradicating the tree at unwanted places as in the fields and along the canal banks was almost impossible because after cutting the stumps coppice vigorously and within a few months, as long as a little water is available, a new shrub has emerged. As early as 1992, experts concluded that whatever the future of BISP, Prosopis will remain there permanently and will change the environment.\n\nCollapse of BISP\nAfter 1992 till 2004 production in Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project was negligible. The cumulative effect of a number of factors caused this failure. The main underlying reason was lack of funds to operate the project. Since 1989 the project did not receive enough funds for cultivating a full crop cycle. Together with poor pest control and lack of adequate irrigation water, this resulted in very low yields and crop failures. Two external factors made the situation worse. Firstly the insecurity in Somalia spilled over into Tana County and the Bura Project area was regularly attacked by well-armed roaming bandits. Secondly, due to high inflation and economic liberalization the prices for agricultural inputs skyrocketed. Thus, the cost for chemicals was Ksh 1,850 in 1987 and 12,000 per ha in 1992. The price for fertilizer went up from 260 to 1,000 per bag. At the same time the cotton price in 1992 remained Ksh 16/= kg, as it had been in 1987. For a full crop cycle the management needed Ksh 98 million and it had received only 10.4 million. Moreover, the figure of 98 million did not include expenditure for maintenance of the inlet and settling basin, the conveyance system, domestic water supply, maintenance of houses, roads and the sewerage system. At that time the conveyance system was considered to have silted up and to need a full rehabilitation. A few years later a study estimated that in total 500 000m3 silt would have to be removed.\n\nSince no agricultural production took place, by 1996 at least one third of the tenants had abandoned the project. The remaining population were mainly women and children as most adult men had left the project to find work elsewhere. In addition to remittances, households were surviving on odd jobs for government, National Youth Service and BISP staff, on charcoal burning and small scale trade. A few NGOs assisted and once in a while famine relief was distributed by both the government and NGOs. Research in 1996 showed that 90% of the Bura population was \u2018at risk and vulnerable\u2019. Most of the people remaining in Bura had no place to go and hoped that the project would be revived. This belief/dream was further dented when during the El Nino rains of 1997 a huge protection dyke at Nanighi was washed away. Subsequently the supply canal became part of the natural drainage system and repairs would be a costly affair.\n\nRehabilitation, Production and Indebtedness\nIn the early stages there was hardly any change after the return of Bura to the NIB. Although the NIB carried out rehabilitation works and installed two new pumps, little production took place until the Economic Stimulus Programme (ESP) was initiated in 2009. The objective of ESP was to jump-start the Kenyan economy towards long-term growth and development after the 2007/2008 post-election violence that affected the Kenyan economy. Earlier in 2007 the government had launched Vision 2030 and one of its flagships was the Bura Irrigation Scheme. Logically Bura became one of the main projects to benefit from the ESP. Under ESP, Bura was to be fully rehabilitated and even expanded. The NIB has claimed that rehabilitation of about 2,500 ha took place successfully, but very little information has been released about the actual area planted with crops, crop production, the number of tenants and their income.\n\nAfter the rehabilitation the NIB introduced a new management system. Since its inception the management of the scheme had been responsible for the water supply and bought inputs centrally. Also the management organized spraying, ploughing and marketing. After harvesting the management deducted  the cost of these services from the proceeds of its tenants. In 2002 the NIB had restructured itself and remained only with core functions, the most important one being the supply of irrigation water. The other functions were delegated  to the private sector and tenants were to be given loans to pay for these services, including the water supply, by commercial financial institutions. At Bura, Equity Bank became the sole active financial institution. Equity charged 10% interest whereas before the tenants did not pay interest. Although water is the main task of the NIB, the tenants in the scheme regularly criticised the NIB for not delivering enough water for the crops as per its mandate.\n\nThis management system could work if a viable cropping pattern would be available, but this was and is lacking at Bura. Tenants planted cotton in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 most tenants made a small profit, but in the next year the crop failed, leaving the tenants without income and with debts with Equity Bank. Since then no cotton has been cultivated as it is considered non-profitable. For food the tenants grew maize, but this crop was commercially not viable and although it has provided the tenants with the necessary subsistence food, it also resulted in more arrears. Moreover, when the tenants wanted to market their surplus maize, there was no market available. Alternative crops (chillies) have also not been successful and left tenants with debts as well. The only crop which has been grown with success is seed maize. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the soils, the margins for this crop are low at Bura and do not make it possible for the tenants to repay already existing debts or to pay for the cost of their food maize.\n\nThe NIB has not released production and income figures for the Bura tenants. It has presented the production figures of all its schemes but Bura in the Economic Review. The information on its website is scanty and annual reports have not been produced despite the fact that parastatals are legally obliged to publish these. The NIB has also not published the total debts of the tenants with Equity Bank. The Bura Farmers Welfare Watch Tower, a local pressure group of tenants, has stated that Equity Bank has reported 65% of the tenants to Credit Reference Bureaus. Officially these tenants have no longer access to credit facilities and could thus no longer grow crops.\n\nThe indebtedness of the tenants became also a matter of concern for the NIB and it replaced Equity Bank with the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), a wholly government-owned Development Finance Institution (DFI). Since 2014 the AFC has financed the production of food and later also of seed maize. AFC disregarded the CBR advice and all tenants were eligible for loans for its loans. Unfortunately there was no market for the surplus food maize produced by the tenants in the first year and this forced farmers to sell their produce for low prices and made it impossible to repay even part of their debts. Many of these tenants were blacklisted by AFC and had again no longer access to credit. In practice this means that these tenants cannot grow any crop at all. In December 2015 a large part of the seed maize crop failed due to lack of irrigation water. This time, and for the first time, the tenants started a legal procedure against the NIB demanding that it compensates the tenants fully for their losses. According to the chairman of the Bura Farmers Welfare Watch Tower, in 2016 the total debt of the tenants (Equity and AFC) was Kshs 240 million or about Ksh 100,000 per tenant.\n\nBura in perspective\n\nThe future for Bura's tenants looks bleak. In the meantime (2017) about half of the original tenants have died and the remaining ones are old and fragile. Business people have started to hire plots from (absentee) tenants for small amounts to grow especially seed maize. Since these people do not have to plant food, they can make a profit.  Many members of the second generation left Bura and after having seen the collapse, have limited interest in returning. The original and second generation tenants still living in Bura hope that a gravity water supply will improve their fate, but it is unclear  when this will be implemented and be ready. Without viable cropping pattern, however, gravity will have little impact apart from making the production of food crops cheaper. In the opinion of the management, genetically modified cotton varieties might become a viable crop. \nSo far the only conclusion can be that, apart from a few years in the eighties, the tenants at Bura have had a miserable life despite the gigantic amounts of money that have been invested. Bura is one of the clearest examples of what Moris has described as a privileged solution in his article '\u00cdrrigation: a privileged solution in African Development'. A privileged solution, in the analysis of Moris, is thought not to require testing and analysis. It is assumed that the solution will deliver and no critical analysis is made of the past performance or its cost effectiveness. A person challenging this solution is ridiculed. In Kenya, obviously, irrigation has this status. Irrigation is postulated as the solution for food problems and drought without analysing the extremely poor performance of this sector. And Bura Irrigation and Settlement Project is the outstanding example of irrigation as a privileged solution.\n-->\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBennett, M., Hamilton, P., and Harrison, M.

It was initiated in the late 1970s, and the first phase was completed in 1988. The project has two components, the irrigation scheme and the settlement scheme. The irrigation scheme involves the construction of a dam on the Tana River, which will provide water for irrigation to farmers in the Tana River District. The settlement scheme involves the construction of a new town, which will provide housing for the farmers who will be displaced by the irrigation scheme. The project has been criticized for its environmental impact, and for its potential to cause social dislocation. The dam will flood a large area of the Tana River, and will change the way of life for many people who live along the river. The new town will also have a significant impact on the landscape, and will require the displacement of many people. The project is being implemented by the Kenya Sugar Board, and is being funded by the government of Kenya and by the World Bank.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51875617}

They were knocked out of the Russian Cup at the Round of 32 stage by Alania Vladikavkaz, and they reached the Last 16 of the Europa League where they were defeated  by AZ.\n\nSeason review\nAnzhi started the season in the same manor as the previous season, entering the transfer market and signing Igor Denisov from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Aleksei Ionov from Kuban Krasnodar, Aleksandr Kokorin from Dynamo Moscow and resigning Christopher Samba from QPR. Following a draw and a defeat in their opening two games, Guus Hiddink resigned as manager on 22 July 2013.\n\nRecently appointed Assistant Coach Rene Meulensteen was then put in charge of the team in a caretaker capacity until 8 August 2013, when Gadzhi Gadzhiyev was appointed as the club's manager for a fifth time. The previous day, the club confirmed that Kerimov had decided to make drastic cuts to the team's budget, and the club's president, Konstantin Remchukov, suggested on Twitter that \"a lot of expensive players will leave\". As a result, Igor Denisov, Yuri Zhirkov and Aleksandr Kokorin, before Kokorin had made his debut, all left Anzhi in a package deal for Dynamo Moscow whilst Oleg Shatov left the club shortly after joining Zenit St. Petersburg.\nThese sales prompted the club to recall Nikita Burmistrov and Serder Serderov from their loan deals, before Mbark Boussoufa and Lassana Diarra then joined Lokomotiv Moscow.

They finished the season in 11th place, whilst also reaching the Fourth Round of the Russian Cup. Following the 2012\u201313 season, Anzhi's billionaire owner, Leonid Mikhelson, decided to reduce the club's budget as a cost-cutting measure, which would lead to the departure of several key players. Manager Guus Hiddink also left the club after the expiry of his contract, with his assistant, Sergei Tashuyev, being appointed as his replacement. Anzhi's pre-season preparations were also affected by the fact that their training ground was being used by the Russian national team as a base for their preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Brazil. Anzhi started the season brightly, winning three of their first five league games, including a 4\u20131 victory over defending champions, CSKA Moscow, on 20 October. However, their form soon dipped, with the team winning just one of their next 13 matches, and they spent much of the rest of the campaign in mid-table. On 3 May, Anzhi lost 1\u20130 to fellow mid-table side, Mordovia Saransk, in their final home match of the season, which led to angry reactions from the club's supporters. Two days later, Anzhi lost 4\u20132 away to Terek Grozny, with both sides being involved in an on-pitch brawl in the closing stages of the match, which resulted in a three-match suspension for Anzhi's goalkeeper, Ilya Pomazun, and a one-match suspension for Terek's manager, Vladimir Cherchesov. Anzhi's final match of the season was a 2\u20131 away defeat to Krasnodar on 17 May, with the result confirming the club's 11th-place finish.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39576252}

Broccoli. The third film in the James Bond series, it was the first to feature the character of Goldfinger, played by Gert Fr\u00f6be, and the first to use the name James Bond. The film also introduced the concept of the Bond girl. The film was based on the novel Goldfinger by Ian Fleming, who also wrote the screenplay. The story centres on the investigation by the British Secret Service, led by agent 007 James Bond, into the disappearance of several scientists involved in the space programme. The main suspect is the German-Jewish scientist Dr. Goldfinger, played by Gert Fr\u00f6be, who is suspected of using a laser-like device to kill the scientists as part of a plan to steal their research for his own personal gain. Bond's mission is to prevent Goldfinger from achieving his goals and to discover what has happened to the scientists. The film was shot in London, Miami, and the Bahamas. The film's score was composed by John Barry and the theme song, \"Goldfinger\", performed by Shirley Bassey, became a popular standard. Goldfinger was well-received by critics and was the highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Goldfinger\", and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for the same track, winning the Grammy Award for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Show. In 2000, it was selected as the second greatest film of all time by the American Film Institute, as part of their 100 Years... 100 Laughs special.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Thomas Martin (Conservative politician)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Thomas Ballantyne Martin (13 November 1901 \u2013 28 January 1995) was a British politician, stockbroker and journalist. After an early career as a private secretary he was unexpectedly elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in Blaydon, a traditionally extremely secure Labour constituency. After standing up in Parliament for the local mining industry he opted out of defending his seat, and could not find election elsewhere; he then became a political journalist. After wartime service in intelligence, he supported Winston Churchill's attempt to bring European unity and then became a stockbroker. A very clubbable man, he attracted interest in the 1990s as a rare survivor of the pre-Second World War Parliament.\n\nEducation\nMartin was the son of Angus Martin, a surgeon from Forest Hall in Northumberland; his mother Robina was from Wooler. He grew up in the borders area but went to Giggleswick School boarding school, and later matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge where he graduated with a Master of Arts.\n\nElection in Blaydon\nDuring the 1920s Martin worked as a private secretary, and was on the staff of the Turkish Embassy in London as its English Secretary in 1928 and in 1930\u201331. He undertook a lecture tour of Germany in 1929. In October 1931, when the general election was already underway, he was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for the constituency of Blaydon in County Durham; the seat had a Labour majority of 13,374 and was thought absolutely safe. However Martin was elected with a majority of 496 as part of the landslide election victory of the National Government; his win was the only time that the seat had been won by a Conservative.\n\nUnparliamentary language\nMartin's first recorded contribution in the chamber of the House of Commons came in December 1931 during bad tempered scenes. Angered by opposition Members jeering at Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was overheard by Labour MP Valentine MacEntee shouting out \"Lie down, dog!\"; MacEntee raised a point of order and challenged him to repeat it outside. The Deputy Speaker Robert Bourne pronounced it unparliamentary and urged Martin to restrain his exuberance.\n\nMining industry\nIn Parliament, Martin concentrated on issues which affected the working lives of his mining constituents. In May 1932 he made his maiden speech on the Coal Mines Bill, urging a system where the mine owner had a guaranteed profit, while the miner had a guaranteed minimum wage, with additions according to the business done. He also endorsed a voluntary national levy on the coal trade to help exports. He accepted that other industries should not be sacrificed to help the coal trade, but urged that operating theatres be set up near to mines to help miners who had suffered industrial accidents.\n\nMartin moved an amendment to the 1933 Budget to limit the tax on hydrocarbon oils to no more than 10%. The Government opposed his amendment and the House of Commons rejected it by 228 to 58. He also voted against the Government and in support of an amendment to remove the profits of Co-operative Societies from tax. He initially supported the National Government's efforts to help distressed areas, urging that the grants be continued until the Unemployment Act replaced them, but by December 1934 was disappointed on behalf of himself and other younger supporters of the Government to find the latest proposals which would not help the basic industries. Martin stated that he could not go back to depressed areas in his constituency and tell them that the Government's policy was a solution to all their problems.\n\nGermany\nWhile a member of parliament, Martin visited Germany where he met leading Nazis Hitler, Goering and Goebbels; he was invited to a Nuremberg rally, but also visited Dachau. When he returned to Britain, Martin warned fellow members of parliament about the dangers of Nazism. He was one of 31 members of parliament to sign a letter endorsing an All-India Federation with provincial autonomy as a way forward of constitutional reform in India.\n\n1935 election\nHe was also much preoccupied with pushing forward a new constitution for the University of Durham. Preparing for the next general election, Martin decided not to defend Blaydon, but was instead adopted as candidate for Camberwell North in inner south London in May 1935. The sitting MP Arthur Bateman had stepped down although at one stage considered standing for neighbouring Peckham as an Independent candidate.\n\nAt the previous election, Camberwell North had produced a Conservative majority of 765, almost as small as at Blaydon. Martin joined the other Conservative candidates for Camberwell divisions in inviting Winston Churchill to speak for them; but observers expected that the leading Labour personality Charles Ammon would succeed in regaining the seat he had lost four years previously. Martin was in the end beaten by nearly two to one, with a substantial majority of 5,777 against him.\n\nDaily Telegraph journalist\nAfter losing his seat, Martin returned to the Palace of Westminster the next year as a political correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, where he remained until 1940. He was also assistant editor of The Spectator, becoming a regular houseguest of Lady Londonderry and of the Astor family at Cliveden. He was a liaison officer between the Foreign Office and the BBC and then volunteered for military service during the Second World War, becoming a Squadron Leader in the Middle East Intelligence Centre (part of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve) from 1940 to 1943, then leaving the services to become adviser on public relations to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia where he remained until the end of the war.\n\nEuropean unity\nIn the 1945 general election, Martin was the Conservative Party candidate in Houghton-le-Spring where he was defeated by 21,866 votes. Martin then became secretary of the United European Movement in 1947, working closely with Winston Churchill for a year before becoming Secretary of the British all-party delegation to the Congress of Europe at The Hague in 1948. There Churchill developed his support for European unity, an attitude of which Martin approved. Martin regretted that Churchill did not maintain his enthusiasm when he returned to government in 1951.\n\nLater life\nMartin developed his career by becoming a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1949, but retained his interest in politics and contributed many letters to newspapers. In 1953 he married for the first time, Jean Bennett; they had two daughters. In 1964 Martin and Dr Charles Goodson-Wickes reformed the Kit Cat Club as an attempt to restart an 18th-century Whig dining club; it gathered a significant membership, many of whom entered public life (Dr Goodson-Wickes himself became a member of parliament). After his retirement from the Stock Exchange in 1974, Martin moved back to the borders area of Northumberland where he lived at Naworth Keep and Dacre Castle. He retained his membership of Pratt's Club where he was said to be \"in his element leading the conversation at the head of the table\"; so welcome was he at the club that when he resigned his membership owing to the decreasing number of visits to London, the club proprietor the Duke of Devonshire refused to accept it and waived the subscription to keep him.\n\nIn 1990 the Speaker of the House of Commons Bernard Weatherill held a dinner in honour of the 23 remaining pre-war MPs at which Martin was one of the star guests; he was interviewed by the BBC afterwards. He appeared in a 1994 documentary on \"Westminster at War\" which interviewed the survivors of the era about what political life was like. He remained mentally alert but in his later years became physically infirm, which he recognised as \"a downward glide\" to a serene death.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1901 births\n1995 deaths\nAlumni of Jesus College, Cambridge\nBritish male journalists\nConservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nPeople educated at Giggleswick School\nStockbrokers\nUK MPs 1931\u20131935\nPeople from Blaydon-on-Tyne\nRoyal Air Force Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II\nRoyal Air Force squadron leaders", "machine_text": " Thomas Martin (21 July 1927 \u2013 1 May 2001) was a British Conservative politician.

It is the tenth feature film based on the sh\u014dnen manga series One Piece by Eiichiro Oda.\n\nThe film features Naoto Takenaka (in Japanese) and Scott McNeil (in English) as Shiki, the evil captain of his crew who kidnaps Nami to force her to join his crew and intends to conquer the East Blue. Monkey D. Luffy and his crew must stop Shiki from carrying out his plans.\n\nPlot \n uses his Devil Fruit powers to destroy marine ships and warn Monkey D. Garp and Fleet Admiral Sengoku. On a floating island, Monkey D. Luffy is chased by a genetically-enhanced animal. The monster is overpowered by the other monsters before Luffy defeats the fourth monster. The Straw Hats have been separated into three groups: Sanji with Usopp, Roronoa Zoro with Tony Tony Chopper, and Nico Robin with Franky and Brook. Shiki tells Nami that she has been taken to the island against her will and a brief flashback is shown: several days earlier, the Straw Hats read news of an attack on East Blue. Luffy vows to protect the East Blue before witnessing Shiki's ship overhead. After escaping a storm, Shiki meets Nami and reveals his powers to make any inanimate object he touches float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning, Shiki offers to take them there before abducting Nami. The others try to rescue her, but Shiki makes the pirates scatter on the island.\n\nShiki asks Nami to become his navigator but she refuses. His minion  demonstrates an evolved bird called , who can produce electricity, but Shiki rejects it after Dr. Indigo is electrocuted. He reveals that a plant, called IQ, can cause animals to evolve instantly and to increase strength along the way. Nami protects Billy, and the bird is left with her as Shiki and his men leave. Meanwhile, Sanji and Usopp battle various animals while Sanji searches for Robin and Nami. Meanwhile, Zoro and Chopper rescue a young girl, , and are led to her village and are told about the large poisonous plants around the village. However, long term exposure to the plants is poisonous to humans, and the girl's grandmother has become ill by it. Xiao was looking for the cure which is the IQ plant, but Shiki has stolen the IQ plants for his experiments. Sanji and Usopp learn that Shiki also takes all the men and young women to his royal palace, leaving the village with only the very young and old, before meeting up with Zoro and Chopper.\n\nNami flees with the help of Billy, and finds the Thousand Sunny along with Luffy. Robin's group discovers that Shiki is planning to release the animals on the island into East Blue to force the World Government's surrender and that he is planning a demonstration against a village on the floating island to show their power. The two join the others at the village, and they also learn of the plan from the village residents. Shiki confronts and defeats the Straw Hats and offers Nami to rejoin him on the condition that the Cocoyashi Village will be spared. Robin's group arrives and rejoin the rest of the crew. Xiao gives them a tone dial and they replay Nami's farewell message to Luffy, but he angrily leaves before the end.\n\nMeanwhile, Nami attempts to destroy the plants protecting his palace, but gets poisoned herself. Shiki traps her near the plants and heads off to meet the pirate captains gathering. While greeting them, the Straw Hats launch a preemptive strike against Shiki and his henchmen. The group manages to defeat them while Chopper and Usopp are ordered to search for Nami. Nami is found by Billy who helps destroy the plants just as Usopp and Chopper arrive. Chopper soon realizes the only way to save Nami is to find the IQ medicine, but Shiki attempts to stop them. Luffy engages Shiki in a duel. The two find the IQ plant, but find the medicine is being held by Dr. Indigo. Zoro manages to defeat Dr. Indigo and Nami recovers. Sanji and Brook, meanwhile, witness another of Shiki's henchmen, , attempting to kiss Robin, but Sanji defeats Scarlet.\n\nNami, Usopp and Chopper trick Shiki into redirecting his ship to the island, forcing his crew to flee. The Straw Hats rig the palace with explosives. Shiki refocuses his attention on the Straw Hats, but Luffy uses an electric charge and knocks Shiki to the ground, leaving Luffy victorious. The other Straw Hats escape with the Thousand Sunny, using Shiki's pirate sail as a parachute. Luffy is recovered by Billy while the villagers are shown flying away using the wings on their arms. The Marines capture the retreating pirates, including Shiki. As the Marines witness the islands crash into the sea, now free of Shiki's power, they spot the Thousand Sunny. However, the Straw Hats escape. Luffy later learns that Nami's message was actually a coded SOS directed at him that the crew took as a love confession; he tries to listen to the end, but Nami throws it overboard in embarrassment.\n\nVoice cast\n\nProduction \nOda personally supervised the production of Strong World, created the film's original story and over 120 pages of rough drawings. Furthermore, he placed his own name on the film's credits to indicate his desire for a film that is different from its nine predecessors. The actual director of the film is Munehisa Sakai, who is also a former director of the One Piece anime television series. The Japanese rock band Mr. Children performed the film's theme song, \"Fanfare\". Oda had personally offered them the opportunity.\n\nPromotion \nAn English-language teaser trailer of 45 seconds length was shown on the Tokyo International Anime Fair in March 2009 and later placed on the official website of the One Piece franchise's anime films, when it was relaunched around July 2009. The website began streaming a 96 seconds long trailer on August 8, 2009. Yet more footage from the film was shown on the 2009 Jump Super Anime Tour and later posted on the website of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.\n\nIn the 49th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, the manga anthology that has been publishing One Piece ever since the series' premiere, the magazine announced that it would publish the prequel to the film's story, depicting a confrontation between the Pirate King Gol D. Roger and Shiki the Golden Lion, which the first 1.5 million Japanese moviegoers where promised to receive in form of a One Piece manga \"Volume 0\", in its 53rd issue and that it will eventually be animated. The One Piece anime television series' episodes 426 through 429 formed a sub-series of special episodes depicting a prelude to the events in the film.\n\nCommemorating the release of the 56th volume of One Piece, on November 4, 2009, almost within a week to Strong World'''s premiere, the Friday morning issue of the major Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun contained nine full-page spreads, showing One Piece characters and advertisements for Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. On December 10, 2009, only two days before the film's premiere, Shueisha's fashion magazine Men's Non-No released its January issue, its cover adorned by an Oda-drawn Luffy in a look by stylist Shinichi \"Miter\" Mita, which not only marked the first time that Oda drew the cover for a non-manga magazine, but also the first time that a manga character has been on the cover in the magazine's 24-year history. The first eight pages of the issue are occupied by photographs of models, resembling Luffy, Robin, Nami, Zoro, and Sanji, dressed in sea and pirates themed clothes. Furthermore, the issue contains interviews with Oda and K\u014dsuke Kitajima.\n\nThe promotions surrounding Strong World boosted the sales of the One Piece manga during the week of December 7 through 13, causing all 56 then published volumes to be listed in Oricon's Top 200 chart of weekly Japanese manga sales.\n\n Release \nOn December 12, 2009, Strong World opened on 188 screens throughout Japan. For comparison, Ponyo set the record of screens for a domestic film to 481 in July 2008 and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered in Japan in July 2009 on 844 screens.\n\nThe first 1.5 million moviegoers received the \"0th volume\" of the One Piece manga series, containing a prequel story that depicts events from 20 years into the past of the One Piece world, as well as the materials Oda created for Strong World's production. After the film's success on its first weekend of showing, Toei decided to extend the offer by another million copies of the manga.\n\nThe Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack release of the film was released on August 27, 2010.\n\nThe film has been licensed, along with Season 5 of One Piece, in North America by Funimation. Funimation announced on July 3, 2013, at Anime Expo that Strong World would be released in the United States on November 19, 2013. The Region 1 release omits the ending theme, \"Fanfare\" by Mr. Children, due to rights issues, though it is mentioned to be the ending in both the English and Japanese credits at the end of the film. Both Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack and the single DVD begin with a disclaimer explaining the removal of the song.\n\nOne Piece Strong World was released in France on August 24, 2011.

Anime News Network attributes part of this success, which includes a 1st place on the Japanese and a fourth place on the international box office over the time frame December 11 through 14, to Toei's giving-away of the \"One Piece Volume 0\" manga.\n\nOver the weekend of December 19 and 20, Strong World topped the Japanese box office for a second time in a row and, with $22,500,000 earned in its first eight days of showing, set a new company record for Toei, beating Aibo, the record holder from 2008, which needed two more days to reach the same amount and eventually finished with a total gross revenue of $50,000,000, a sum Toei expects Strong World to exceed by $7,000,000.\n\nIn its third week, Strong World fell to the 3rd place on Kogyo Tsushinsha's Japanese box office chart and to the 4th place on the charts of Variety and Rentrak Theatrical.

Chris Beveridge of The Fandom post described the film as \"a very streamlined Oda story that would have gone on for twenty or thirty episodes if it was done as a regular arc with the TV series\", adding that the storyline was \"predictable\" but also \"well polished\". Beveridge also praised the film for having a stronger connection to the One Piece TV series than the franchises previous films. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network awarded the film a 'B' rating, praising the storyline and character design. Silverman commented that \"no one can come up with weird laughs or monsters quite like Oda\", although unfavorably comparing some of the animation to \"stop-motion animation\". Silverman also commented on the English dubbing of the film, saying that Ian Sinclair's debut as Brook \"does a very good job with the loopy skeleton\", although she found Scott McNeil's \"pseudo-Caribbean\" accent as Shiki \"a little off-putting\". Despite being largely unfamiliar with the franchise, Kyle Mills of DVD Talk called FUNimations release \"Highly Recommended\", praising the \"terrific cast of characters\" and \"giant kick ass final fight\". Jeffrey Kauffman of Blu-ray.com also recommended Strong World, describing it as \"loud, frenetic and frequently nonsensical,\" but also \"kind of crazily entertaining at the same time\" Kauffman also added that \"while Strong World won't necessarily be incomprehensible to newcomers\", \"those with a solid grounding in the background of the story and its many characters will reap the most rewards from this particular outing\".\nStrong World also currently has a rating of 7.1 out of 10 collated from both film critics and users on IMDb.\n\nAwards and nominations \nIt won the award for Excellent Animation of the Year at the 34th Japan Academy Prize and is nominated for Animation of the Year.\n\nSee also\n List of One Piece films\n List of One Piece media\n List of 2009 box office number-one films in Japan\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Toei Animation \n\n2009 films\nJapanese films\n2009 anime films\nFunimation\nToei Animation films\nStrong World\nFilms scored by Kohei Tanaka", "machine_text": " One Piece Film: Strong World One Piece Film: Strong World is a 2008 Japanese anime film, the fifth installment in the One Piece film series, following The Movie, which itself followed the second season of the One Piece anime series.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Origin theories of Christopher Columbus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The exact ethnic or national origin of Christopher Columbus (1451\u20131506) has been a source of speculation since the 19th century. The general consensus among historians is that Columbus's family was from the coastal region of Liguria, that he spent his boyhood and early youth in the Republic of Genoa, in Genoa, in Vico Diritto, and that he subsequently lived in Savona, where his father Domenico moved in 1470. Much evidence derives from data concerning Columbus's immediate family connections in Genoa and opinions voiced by contemporaries concerning his Genoese origins, which few dispute.\n\nMany other hypotheses exist, none of which are broadly accepted. \n\nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins began in 2021.\n\nGenoese origin\n\nDocuments \nIn a 1498 deed of primogeniture, Columbus writes:\n\nMany historians, including a distinguished Spanish scholar, Altolaguirre, affirm the document's authenticity; others believe it apocryphal. Some believe that the fact that it was produced in court, during a lawsuit among the heirs of Columbus, in 1578, does not strengthen the case for its being genuine.\n\nA letter from Columbus, dated 2 April 1502, to the Bank of Saint George, the oldest and most reputable of Genoa's financial institutions, begins with the words:\n\nAlthough some people consider this letter suspect, the vast majority of scholars believe it genuine. The most scrupulous examination by graphologists testifies in favour of authenticity. The letter is one of a group of documents entrusted by Columbus to a Genoese friend, after the bitter experiences of his third voyage, before setting out on his fourth.\n\nIn the spring of 1502, Columbus collected notarized copies of all the writings concerned with his rights to the discovery of new lands. He sent these documents to Nicol\u00f2 Oderico, ambassador of the Republic of Genoa. To Oderico he also gave \"the letter to the Bank of Saint George\", in which he announced that he was leaving the bank one-tenth of his income, with a recommendation for his son Diego. Oderico returned to Genoa and delivered the letter to the bank. The bank replied on 8 December 1502, lauding the gesture of their \"renowned fellow-citizen\" towards his \"native land\". The reply, unfortunately, never reached its destination; Columbus, back in Castile after his fourth voyage, complained about this in another letter to Ambassador Oderico, dated 27 December 1504, and promptly annulled the bequest.\n\nThe first letter was preserved in the archives of the Bank of Saint George until it was taken over by the municipality of Genoa; the other three remained in the Oderico family archives until 1670, when they were donated to the Republic of Genoa. After the fall of the Republic, they passed to the library of one of its last senators, Michele Cambiaso, and were finally acquired by the city of Genoa.  There are also public and notarial acts (more than a hundred) \u2014 copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona \u2014 regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\n\nAnother doubt remains to be settled: that is, whether or not all of the documents cited concern the Christopher Columbus who was later to become Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, admiral of the Ocean Sea in Spanish territory. The list of contemporary ambassadors and historians unanimous in the belief that Columbus was Genoese could suffice as proof, but there is something more: a document dated 22 September 1470 in which the criminal judge convicts Domenico Colombo. The conviction is tied to the debt of Domenico \u2014 together with his son Christopher (explicitly stated in the document) \u2014 toward a certain Girolamo del Porto. In the will dictated by Admiral Christopher Columbus in Valladolid before he died, the authentic and indisputable document which we have today, the dying navigator remembers this old debt, which had evidently not been paid. There is, in addition, the act drawn in Genoa on 25 August 1479 by a notary, Girolamo Ventimiglia. This act is known as the Assereto document, after the scholar who found it in the State Archives in Genoa in 1904. It involves a lawsuit over a sugar transaction on the Atlantic island Madeira. In it, young Christopher swore that he was a 27-year-old Genoese citizen resident in Portugal and had been hired to represent the Genoese merchants in that transaction. Here was proof that he had relocated to Portugal. It is important to bear in mind that at the time when Assereto traced the document, it would have been impossible to make an acceptable facsimile. Nowadays, with modern chemical processes, a document can be \"manufactured\", made to look centuries old if need be, with such skill that it may be difficult to prove it is a fake. In 1960, this was still impossible.\n\nIn addition to the two documents cited, there are others that confirm the identification of the Genoese Christopher Columbus, son of Domenico, with the admiral of Spain. An act dated 11 October 1496 says:\n\t\n\nIn a fourth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 8 April 1500, Sebastiano Cuneo, heir by half to his father Corrado, requested that Christopher and Giacomo (called Diego), the sons and heirs of Domenico Colombo, be summoned to court and sentenced to pay the price for two lands located in Legine. This document confirms Christoforo and Diego's absence from the Republic of Genoa with these exact words: \"dicti conventi sunt absentes ultra Pisas et Niciam.\"\n\t \nA fifth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 26 January 1501, is more explicit. A group of Genoese citizens, under oath, said and say, together and separately and in every more valid manner and guise, that Christopher, Bartholomew and Giacomo Columbus, sons and heirs of the aforementioned Domenico, their father, have for a long time been absent from the city and the jurisdiction of Savona, as well as Pisa and Nice in Provence, and that they reside in the area of Spain, as was and is well known.\n\t \nFinally, there is a very important sixth document from the notary of Bartolomeo Oddino, drawn in Savona on 30 March 1515. With this notarial act, Leon Pancaldo, the well-known Savonese who would become one of the pilots for Magellan's voyage, sends his own father-in-law in his place as procurator for Diego Columbus, son of Admiral Christopher Columbus. The document demonstrates how the ties, in part economic, of the discoverer's family with Savona survived even his death.\n\nThe life of Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand \nA biography written by Columbus's son Ferdinand (in Spanish and translated to Italian), Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo; nelle quali s'ha particolare, et vera relatione della vita, et de' fatti dell'Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre; Et dello scoprimento, ch'egli fece delle Indie Occidentali, dette Nuovo Mondo (\"Accounts of His Lordship Ferdinand Columbus; among which there are particulars and a true relation of the life, and of the deeds of the Admiral, Sir Christopher Columbus, his father; and of the discovery, which he made, of the West Indies, called the New World,\" abbreviated as \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand\"), exists.<ref>Col\u00f3n, Fernando (translated by Benjamin Keen). \"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus, Greenwood Press, 1978. Retrieved 2006-10-10.</ref>  \nIn it, Ferdinand claimed that his father was of Italian aristocracy. He describes Columbus to be a descendant of a Count Columbo of the Castle Cuccaro (Montferrat). Columbo was in turn said to be descended from a legendary Roman General Colonius. It is now widely believed that Christopher Columbus used this persona to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy, an elaborate illusion to mask a humble merchant background. Ferdinand dismissed the fanciful story that the Admiral descended from the Colonus mentioned by Tacitus. However, he refers to \"those two illustrious Coloni, his relatives.\" According to Note 1, on page 287, these two \"were corsairs not related to each other or to Christopher Columbus, one being Guillame de Casenove, nicknamed Colombo, Admiral of France in the reign of Louis XI\". At the top of page 4, Ferdinand listed Nervi, Cogoleto, Bogliasco, Savona, Genoa and Piacenza (all inside the former Republic of Genoa) as possible places of origin. He also stated:\n\nIn chapter ii, Ferdinand accuses Agostino Giustiniani of telling lies about the discoverer:\n\nIn chapter v, he writes:\n\nFerdinand also says (chapter xi) that before he was declared admiral, his father used to sign himself \"Columbus de Terra rubra,\" that is to say, Columbus of Terrarossa, a village or hamlet near Genoa. In another passage, Ferdinand says that his father went to Lisbon and taught his brother Bartholomew to construct sea charts, globes and nautical instruments; and sent this brother to England to make proposals to Henry VII of his desired voyage. Finally, Ferdinand says incidentally (chapter lxxii) that Christopher's brother, Bartholomew Columbus named the new settlement Santo Domingo in memory of their father, Domenico.\n\nThe publication of Historie has been used by historians as providing indirect evidence about the Genoese origin of Columbus.\n\n The testimony of the ambassadors \nIt is significant that no one protested at the court of Spain when in April 1501, in the feverish atmosphere of the great discovery, Nicol\u00f2 Oderico, ambassador of the Genoese Republic, after praising the Catholic Sovereigns, went on to say that they \"discovered with great expenditure hidden and inaccessible places under the command of Columbus, our fellow-citizen, and having tamed wild barbarians and unknown peoples, they educated them in religion, manners and laws\". Furthermore, two diplomats from Venice \u2014 no great friend of Genoa, indeed, a jealous rival \u2014 added the appellation \"Genoese\" to Columbus's name: the first, Angelo Trevisan, in 1501, the second, Gasparo Contarini, in 1525. In 1498, Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to the English court, mentioned John Cabot, \"the discoverer, another Genoese, like Columbus\". All these references were published, along with reproductions of some of the original documents, in the City of Genoa volume of 1931.\n\n Support for the Genoese origin from contemporary European writers \nThe historian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, whose father traveled with Columbus on his second journey and who personally knew Columbus's sons, writes in chapter 2 of his Historia de las Indias:\n\nThe historian Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s, writes that Domenico Colombo was the Admiral's father; and in chapter 2, book 3 of his Historia general y natural de las Indias:\n\nMany contemporary writers agree that the discoverer was Genoese:\n\nThe Portuguese Rui de Pina wrote two works, Chronica d'El Rey, dom Affonso and Chronica d'El Rey, dom Jo\u00e3o II. It has been ascertained that the manuscripts had been completed before 1504, although they were published in the Eighteenth century. Chapter 66 in the second manuscript, \"Descubrimiento das Ilhas de Castella per Collombo,\" explicitly states, \"Christovan Colombo italiano.\"\nIn the 1513 edition of the Map of the New World from Ptolemy, it says: \"This land with the adjacent islands was discovered by the Genoese Columbus, sent by the King of Castile.\"\nThe Turkish geographer Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, known as Piri Reis, in his map of 1513, writes: \"These coasts are called the coasts of the Antilles. They were discovered in the year 896 of the Arabic calendar. It is said that a Genoese infidel, Columbus by name, discovered the place.\"\nHernando Alonso de Herrera, in his anti-Aristotelian dissertation, completed in Salamanca in 1516, and published in Latin and Spanish, wrote: \"Xristoval Colon ginoves.\"\nIn a Portuguese map of 1520, it is said: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile, discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe German Peter von Bennewitz writes, in 1520, in the Typus Orbis Universalis: \"In the year 1497 (sic) this land (America) with the adjacent islands was discovered by Columbus, a Genoese by mandate of the King of Castile.\"\nThe German Johannes Sch\u00f6ner states in the Globus of 1520: \"This (island) produces gold, mastic, aloes, porcelain, etc. and ginger \u2014 Latitude of the island 440 miles \u2014 Longitude 880 \u2014 discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese, captain of the King of Castile in the year of Our Lord 1492.\"\nThe Spaniard Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara writes: \"Christopher Columbus was originally from Cogurreo or Nervi, a village of Genoa, a very famous Italian city.\"\nThe Portuguese Garcia de Resende, poet and editor, writes: \"Christouao Colombo, italiano.\"\nThe Swiss Heinrich Glarean (Loriti) writes: \"To the west there is a land they call America. Two islands, Hispaniola and Isabella: which regions were travelled, along the coast, by the Spaniards, by the Genoese Columbus and by Amerigo Vespuzio.\"\nThe Spaniard Hieronymo Girava, who lived in the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoval Colon Genoese, great seaman and mediocre cosmographer.\"\nThe Portuguese Jo\u00e3o de Barros writes: \"As all men declare, Christov\u00e3o Colom was of Genoese nation, a man expert, eloquent and good Latinist, and very boastful in his affairs\"; and: \"As in this kingdom came Christopher Columbus Genoese, who had just discovered the western islands that now we call Antilles.\"\nThe German known as Giovanni Boemo Aubano, of the first half of the 16th century, writes: \"Christoforo Palombo, Genoese, the year 1492.\"\nThe Flemish Abraham Ortelius, writes: \"It seems to surpass the bounds of human wonder that all this hemisphere (that today is called America and, because of its immense extent, the New World) remained unknown to the ancients until the Christian year 1492, in which it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is, writes: \"The Genoese Columbus, a man expert in nautical arts\" ; and, in the index: \"Columbi genuen- sis, alias Coloni commendatio.\" \nThe Spaniard Nicol\u00e1s Monardes, writes: \"In the year 1492 our Spaniards were led by don Christoval Colon, native of Genoa, to discover the West Indies.\"\nThe German Laurentius Surius, writes: \"There was at the court of the King of Spain a certain Christopher Columbus whose homeland was Genoa.\"\nIn 1579, for the Cristoph Pantin's edition, the yearbooks of the Genoese Senate were published, in Antwerp, edited by Petro Bizaro: Senatus Populique Genuensis rerum domi forisque gestarum historiae atque annales. Among what is written to celebrate many industrious Genoese men, you can read that: \"cum Christophoro Columbo navalis scientiae absolutissima peritia apud omnem venturam posteritatem, juro optima aliqua ex parte conferri vel comparari possit.\"\nThe Portuguese Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado in the Atlante of 1580, notes: \"Land of the Antipodes of the King of Castile discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Spaniard Alvaro Gomez, writes: \"Thanks to the eager industry of Christopher Columbus Genoese, word was brought to our Sovereigns of an unknown world.\"\nThe Frenchman Gilbert G\u00e9nebrard, writes: \"Ferdinand, at the urging of his wife Isabella, Queen of Castile, Le\u00f2n and Aragon, sent Christopher Columbus Genoese to seek new land.\"\nThe Swiss Theodor Zwinger, who died in 1588, was the author of the Theatrum Humanae Vitae, Basle 1604. In the index we read: \"Cristoforo Colono, or Colombo Genoese.\"\nOn an unspecified date, certainly prior to 1591, the Turk Basmagi Ibrahim published a book, written by a Turkish author who has remained anonymous, entitled Turich-i-Hind-i garbi iachod hadis-i-nev (History of the West Indies, in other words the New Story). The third chapter of this book dedicated to the discoverer of the \"New World or New Land,\" states: \"From the village of Nervi, which is among the Genoese possessions, a man who was born who had the name Christopher and the surname Columbus. Since he had completed journeys by land and by sea [...] he stayed on an island by the name of Madeira [...] under the domain of the wretched (sic) Portugal.\"\nThe Flemish Theodor De Bry, writes: \"From everything it can be stated with certainty that it was first discovered by Christopher Columbus Genoese.\"\nThe Portuguese Gaspar Frutuoso, in a sixteenth-century manuscript entitled As Saudades da terra, printed by Alvaro Rodriguez Azevedo in 1873 in Funchal (Madeira), writes in the Anales of Porto Santo: \"On this island the great Christovao Colombo, the Genoese, resided for some time.\"\nThe German David Chytraeus writes: \"Primum Novum Orbem in occidente, omnibus antea ignotum et inaccessam... pervestigare et aperire... Christophorus Columbus Genesis, admirand ad omnen posteritatem ausu et industria coeperat.\"\nIn the volume published by the City of Genoa the testimony is cited of the historian Andres Bernaldez, who died in 1513. He was the author of a Historia de los Reyes Catolicos don Fernando y dona Isabel. In this work, belatedly published in Seville in 1869, it is written: \"In the name of Almighty God, a man of the land of Genoa, a merchant of printed books who was called Christopher Columbus.\" Actually, in the original text of Bernaldez, it says \"land of Milan\". However, this is merely lack of precision. In the 15th century, the Republic of Genoa was alternately fully and legally dependent on the Duchy of Milan and the latter's satellite. The editor rightly interpreted the Milanese reference in the sense of Genoese origin.\n\nColumbus's Genoese birth is also confirmed by the works of the English Hakluyt (1601), of the Spaniard Antonio de Herrera (1612), the great Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega (1614), a paper manuscript dated 1626, conserved in Madrid's National Library, the works of the German Filioop Cluwer (1677), the German Giovanni Enrico Alsted (1649), the French Dionisio Petau (1724), and the Spaniard Luigi de Marmol (1667). This list represents the early writings of non-Italians. There were sixty-two Italian testimonies between 1502 and 1600. Of these fourteen are from Ligurian writers. It may be obvious, but not useless, to underline that the Venetians' (e.g. Trevisan's and Ramusio's) recognition of Columbus's Genoese birth constitutes a testimony as impartial as that of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese.\n\nConformable to the testament in Seville (3 July 1539) is the evidence of Ferdinand Columbus, who states that his father was conterraneo (of the same country) with Mons. Agostino Giustiniani, who was, beyond all doubt, Martini, Dario G. \"Cristoforo Colombo tra ragione e fantasia.\" ECIG, 1987. pp. 12 and 513.

In his letter of May 14, 1493, addressed to Giovanni Borromeo, he referred to Columbus as Ligurian, Liguria being the Region where Genoa is located.\nMichele da Cuneo from Savona, a friend of Columbus's (possibly from childhood), sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: \"In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral.\"\nGiambattista Strozzi, a Florentine merchant, reported in a letter sent from Cadiz on March 19, 1494: \"On the 7th of this month there arrived here in safety twelve caravels which came from the new islands found by Columbus Savonese, Admiral of the Ocean, for the king of Castile, having come in twenty-five days from the said islands of the Antilles.\"\nCes\u00e1reo Fern\u00e1ndez Duro in his book Col\u00f3n y la Historia postuma, mentions the chronicler Alonso Estanquez, who has composed a Cr\u00f3nica de los reyes don Fernando y do\u00f1a Isabel, before 1506, where he writes: \"Cristobal Col\u00f3n, genov\u00e9s.\"\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseem\u00fcller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. Below the island of Hispaniola, near the coast of Paria (Central America) he inserted the words: \"Iste insule per Columbum genuensem almirantem ex ma[n]dato regis Castelle invent[a]e sunt\" or \"these islands have been discovered by the Genoese admiral Columbus by order of the king of Castile.\"\nWitnesses in the 1511 and 1532 hearings in the Pleitos agreed that Columbus was from the Ligur. Another witness at the same hearing placed it more precisely, testifying, \"I heard it said that [he] was from the seigneury of Genoa, from the city of Savona.\" \nFather Antonio de Aspa, a Hieronymite from the convent of Mejorada, between 1512 and 1524, wrote a report on Columbus's first voyage, drawn largely from the Decades of Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, in which he claimed that Columbus was Genoese. \nThe Portuguese Jorge Reinel, in his map of 1519, writes the following words: \"Xpoforum c\u00f5lombum genuensem.\" \nThe German Simon Grynaeus, writes: \"Christophorus natione Italicus, patria Genuensis, gente Columba.\"\nD. Diego, a grandson of the admiral, was knight of the Order of Santiago, in the genealogy section, of 1535, says: \"Paternal Grandparents / Christopher Columbus, a native of Saona near Genoa, / and Filipa Moniz, a native of Libon.\" In the same year, Pedro de Arana, a cousin of Columbus's Spanish mistress, testified that he knew Columbus was from Genoa. \nThe Spaniard Alonzo de Santa Cruz, c. 1550, said Columbus was from Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n writes that Columbus was originally from Savona.\nIn his Commentarius de Ophyra regione apud Divinam Scripturam Commemorata of 1561, the Portuguese geographer Gaspar Barreiros, reported that Columbus was \"Ligurian.\" \nThe Spaniard Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita y Castro, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, man, as he said, whose company had always been for the sea and its predecessors, so that was foreign born and raised in poverty and the banks of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio Galv\u00e3o, writes: \"In the yeere 1492, in the time of Don Ferdinando king of Castile, he being at the siege of Granada, dispatched one Christopher Columbus a Genoway with three ships to goe and discouer Noua Spagna.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo de Illescas, writes: \"Christopher Columbus Genoese, was born at Nervi, a village near to Genoa.\"\nThe Spaniard Esteban de Garibay, humanist and historian, writes: \"A man of the Italian nation, named Christopher Columbus, native of Cugurco (Cogoleto), or Nervi, village of Genoa.\"\nThe Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Matalio Metelo Sequano in 1580, writes that Columbus was born in the city of Genoa. \nThe Frenchman Lancelot Voisin de La Popelini\u00e8re, writes: \"La plupart des princes chretiens, le nostre sur tous, l'Anglais, le Portugais, l'Espagnol m\u00e9mes, n'avaient daign\u00e9 pr\u00e9ster sculement l'ou\u00ede a l'ouverture que l'ltalien leur faisait.\"\nThe Spaniard Juli\u00e1n del Castillo, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, an Italian, was originally from Cogurio (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village near to the famous city of Genoa.\"\nThe German Michael Neander, writes: \"Christophoro Colombo Genuensi.\"\nThe Spaniard Gonzalo Argote de Molina clearly identified Albissola Marina as Columbus's birthplace.\nFriar Juan de la Victoria, author of the 16th century, wrote a Cat\u00e1logo de los Reyes godos de Espa\u00f1a extracted from Fern\u00e1ndez Duro in his Col\u00f3n y La Historia Postuma; says the friar: \"In the year 1488, the Italian Christopher Columbus, native of Cugureo (Cogoleto) or Nervi, village of Genoa, sailor.\"\nThe Spaniard Juan de Castellanos, poet and chronicler, writes that Columbus was born in Nervi.\nThe Spaniard Juan de Mariana, writes: \"Christopher Columbus, Genoese of nation.\"\nThe Portuguese Pedro de Mariz, historian and librarian, says that Columbus was Genoese.\n\n Historians \n\nScholars agree that Columbus was Genoese.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison, in his book Christopher Columbus: Admiral of the Ocean Sea, notes that many existing legal documents demonstrate the Genoese origin of Columbus, his father Domenico, and his brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo (Diego). These documents, written in Latin by notaries, were legally valid in Genoese courts. The documents, uncovered in the 19th century when Italian historians examined the Genoese archives, form part of the Raccolta Colombiana. On page 14, Morison writes:Besides these documents from which we may glean facts about Christopher's early life, there are others which identify the Discoverer as the son of Domenico the wool weaver, beyond the possibility of doubt. For instance, Domenico had a brother Antonio, like him a respectable member of the lower middle class in Genoa. Antonio had three sons: Matteo, Amigeto and Giovanni, who was generally known as Giannetto (the Genoese equivalent of \"Johnny\"). Giannetto, like Christopher, gave up a humdrum occupation to follow the sea. In 1496 the three brothers met in a notary's office at Genoa and agreed that Johnny should go to Spain and seek out his first cousin \"Don Cristoforo de Colombo, Admiral of the King of Spain,\" each contributing one third of the traveling expenses. This quest for a job was highly successful. The Admiral gave Johnny command of a caravel on the Third Voyage to America, and entrusted him with confidential matters as well.\n\nOn the topic of Columbus's being born somewhere besides Genoa, Morison states: Every contemporary Spaniard or Portuguese who wrote about Columbus and his discoveries calls him Genoese. Four contemporary Genoese chroniclers claim him as a compatriot. Every early map on which his nationality is recorded describes him as Genoese or Ligur, a citizen of the Ligurian Republic. Nobody in the Admiral's lifetime, or for three centuries after, had any doubt about his birthplace.\n\nPaolo Emilio Taviani, in his book Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea discusses \"the public and notarial acts \u2013 original copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona \u2013 regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\" In Columbus the Great Adventure he further claims that Columbus named the small island of Saona \"to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.\"\nThis is fully accepted by Consuelo Varela Bueno, \"Spain's leading authority on the texts, documents, and handwriting of Columbus.\" She devotes several pages to the question of Columbus native land, and concludes that \"all chroniclers of that period wrote that he was from Liguria in northern Italy.\" The evidence supporting the Genoese origin of Columbus is also discussed by Miles H. Davidson. In his book Columbus Then and Now: A Life Reexamined, he writes:Diego M\u00e9ndez, one of his captains, in testimony given in the ''Pleitos'', he said that Columbus was \"Genoese, a native of Savona which is a town near Genoa.\" Those who reject this and the more than ample other contemporary evidence, given by both Italian and Spanish sources as well as by witnesses at these court hearings, are simply flying in the face of overwhelming evidence. [...] What is the reason behind so much futile speculation? It can be mostly attributed to parochialism. Each of the nations and cities mentioned wants to claim him for its own. Since no effort was made to locate the supporting data until the early nineteenth century, and since at that time not all of the archives had been adequately researched, there was, initially, justification for those early efforts to establish who he was and where he came from. To do so today is to fulfill Montaigne's maxim, \"No one is exempt from talking non-sense; the misfortune is to do it solemnly.\"\n\n Language \nThe spoken language of Genova and the Ligurian coast would primarily have been the Ligurian language. The Italian language was originally based on the fourteenth century vernacular of Florence in the adjacent region of Tuscany, and would not have been the main spoken language of Genova in the fifteenth century.\n\nAlthough Columbus wrote almost exclusively in Spanish, there is a small handwritten Genoese gloss in a 1498 Italian (from Venice) edition of Pliny's Natural History that he read after his second voyage to America: this shows Columbus was able to write in Genoese and read Italian. There is also a note in Italian in his own Book of Prophecies exhibiting, according to historian August Kling, \"characteristics of northern Italian humanism in its calligraphy, syntax, and spelling\". Phillips and Phillips point out that 500 years ago, the Romance languages had not distanced themselves to the degree they have today. Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas in his Historia de las Indias claimed that Columbus did not know Spanish well and that he was not born in Castile.\n\nValiant scholars have dedicated themselves to the subject of Christopher Columbus's language. They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other writings of his that have come down to the modern day. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. Christopher Columbus's language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Portuguese, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.\n\n Iberian origin \nCrypto-Judaism \nSalvador de Madariaga argued in 1940, that Columbus was a marrano forced to leave Spain for Genoa. Different scholars like Jose Erugo, Celso Garcia de la Riega, Otero Sanchez and Nicholas Dias Perez have since concluded that Columbus may have had a Jewish background. This hypothesis is founded on many observations about Columbus, for example: his reference to the expulsion of the Jews in his first accounts, the reference to the Second Temple of Jerusalem by the Hebraic term \"Second House\", the Hebrew letters bet-hei (meaning B'ezrat hashem) on all but one of his letters to his son, and an anagram that was a cryptic substitute for the Kaddish, according to Cecil Roth. \n\nSecondly, another evidence is reflected by the fact that all the personalities who supported Columbus before the kings are of Jewish origin and that his voyage was mainly funded by two Jewish conversos and a prominent Jew: Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel, Gabriel Sanchez, and Don Isaac Abrabanel, respectively.\n\nPrior to 1892, the Church demanded from all dioceses all existing documentation on Christopher Columbus. Once all the documentation was received at the Vatican, the beatification process never began, according to proponents of Jewish theory because they realized that Columbus was Jewish.\n\nIn a 1973 book, Simon Wiesenthal postulated that Columbus was a Sephardi, careful to conceal his Judaism yet also eager to locate a place of refuge for his persecuted fellow countrymen. Wiesenthal argued that Columbus's concept of sailing west to reach the Indies was less the result of geographical theories than of his faith in certain Biblical texts\u2014specifically the Book of Isaiah. He repeatedly cited two verses from that book: \"Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them,\" (60:9); and \"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth\" (65:17). Wiesenthal claimed that Columbus felt that his voyages had confirmed these prophecies. Jane Francis Amler shared those views in 1977. Estelle Irizarry echoed this as well, further noting that Columbus always wrote in Spanish, occasionally included Hebrew in his writing, and referenced the Jewish High Holidays in his journal during the first voyage.\n\nA document suggests that Columbus belonged to a Marrano family from Majorcan origin. However the authenticity of the document hasn't been proved. The novelist Robert Graves argued: \"his surname is still common in the island.\"\n\n Catalan \nSince the early 20th century, researchers have attempted to connect Columbus to the Catalan-speaking areas of Spain, usually based on linguistic evidence. The first to propose a birthplace under the Crown of Aragon was Peruvian historian Luis Ulloa in a  book originally published in 1927 in French. Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, University of Madrid historian of America, said that Ulloa's \"fiery imagination\" had placed abstruse interpretations on court documents to support his thesis, had found no positive proof, and had dismissed as false any evidence supporting a Genoese origin.\n\nThroughout Columbus's life, he referred to himself as Christobal Colom; his contemporaries and family also referred to him as such. It is possible that Colom is the shortened form of Columbus used for the Italian surname Colombo (which means \"dove\"). Colom can also be a Portuguese, French, or Catalan name, and in the latter means \"dove\". \nSome more recent studies also state Columbus had Catalan origins, based on his handwriting, though these have been disputed. Charles J. Merrill, a specialist in medieval Catalan literature at Mount St. Mary's University, claims Columbus's handwriting is typical of a native Catalan, and his mistakes in Castilian are \"most likely\" transfer errors from Catalan, with examples such as \"a todo arreo\" (a tot arreu), \"todo de un golpe\" (tot d'un cop), \"setcentas\" (set-centes), \"nombre\" (instead of n\u00famero), \"al sol puesto\" (el sol post). Merrill states that the Genoese Cristoforo Colombo was a modest wool carder and cheese merchant with no maritime training and whose age does not match the one of Columbus. Merrill's book Colom of Catalonia was published in 2008.\n\n Portugal \n\nPatroc\u00ednio Ribeiro claimed that Columbus was Portuguese in 1916, and Mois\u00e9s Bensabat Amzalak hypothesized on Columbus's signature with the Kabbalah. Based on those theories, Jos\u00e9 Mascarenhas Barreto argued in 1988, that Columbus was a Portuguese agent who hatched up an elaborate diversion to keep the Spanish from the lucrative trade routes, and suggested he was born in Cuba, Portugal, while his real name was supposedly Salvador Fernandes Zarco''. However, the genealogy presented has been disputed\n\nProponents of the Portuguese hypothesis also point to a court document which stated that Columbus's nationality was \"Portuguese\" and in another Columbus uses the words \"my homeland\" in relation to Portugal.\n\nOther theories \nOther theories claim that Columbus was a Byzantine Greek nobleman, a Sardinian nobleman, a Norwegian, a Scot, or that he was the son of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Varna. Many cities have been hypothesized as the birthplace of Columbus, notably Calvi in Corsica, which in Columbus's times was under Genoese rule. \n\nBritish historian Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, writes in his book:The Catalan, French, Galician, Greek, Ibizan, Jewish, Majorcan, Scottish, and other Columbuses concocted by historical fantasists are agenda-driven creations, usually inspired by a desire to arrogate a supposed or confected hero to the cause of a particular nation or historic community \u2013 or, more often than not, to some immigrant group striving to establish a special place of esteem in the United States. The evidence of Columbus's origins in Genoa is overwhelming: almost no other figure of his class or designation has left so clear a paper trail in the archives.\n\nDNA study \nAn international DNA study aimed at determining Columbus's origins was begun in 2021, using the remains in Seville.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences \n\nColumbus family\nChristopher Columbus\nColumbus, Christopher\nColumbus, Christopher", "machine_text": " The origin theories of Christopher Columbus include several unproven hypotheses concerning the geographical origin of the first European explorer to reach the Caribbean islands in 1492. During the 20th century, scholars advanced several theories that competed with the traditional belief that Columbus was from the Italian region of Liguria in Italy. These included theories that Columbus was from the ports of Portuguese Galicia, that he was from the Canary Islands, or even that he was from the Middle East. In the 21st century, DNA analysis of Columbus' remains is planned to settle the matter. In the 20th century, several scholars advanced theories that competed with the traditional belief that Columbus was from the Italian region of Liguria. The first was the theory that Columbus was from the ports of Portuguese Galicia, which had been part of the kingdom of Le\u00f3n until the mid-13th century. In the early 20th century, the Portuguese historian Joel Silva reviewed primary documents relating to Columbus' life and found that some of them, including Columbus' own writings, indicated that he may have been from the Atlantic coast of Spain, perhaps from the region of the R\u00edas Baixas. Silva's theory was first publicly debated in 1951, when he appeared in a television program in Spain. The theory was subsequently embraced by several scholars, including the Spanish historian Paulino de Brito e Abreu, who published the book Columbus: proof that he was Portuguese in 1968. The theory was also supported by the historian Rosa de Friederich, who published an article in 1982 that claimed that Columbus' father, errors in the Historie of the Navigation and Discoveries of the Earls of Medina-Sidonia, and other documents pointed to a Portuguese origin. In 2001, the Portuguese journalist Jose Hermano Saraiva published the book Columbus, a Portuguese from the Azores, which also advanced a theory of Portuguese origin. A second theory that emerged in the 20th century was that Columbus was from the Canary Islands. In 1936, the Spanish historian and journalist Eugenio de Palia published an article suggesting that Columbus was from the island of El Hierro. He was followed by the Canary Islands writer Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez de la Pe\u00f1a, who in 1946 published a book arguing that Columbus was from La Gomera. A third Canary Islands theory, first advanced in 1964 by the historian Juan barker, was that Columbus was from Lanzarote. In the 20th century, other scholars suggested that Columbus may have been from other parts of the Mediterranean, including the Middle East. The Spanish historian Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, who lived in the early 17th century, was the first to advance a theory that Columbus was from the Middle East, specifically from the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In the early 20th century, the French historian and geographer Victor de Champollion separately advanced a theory that Columbus was from the Middle East. In 2007, the Italian historian Paolo Zeno Boxer proposed that Columbus was from Marrakech, in Morocco. In the 21st century, DNA analysis of Columbus' remains is planned to settle the matter. The city of Charlotte, North Carolina, has a large monument to Columbus and an annual festival celebrating him, because a local businessman, Mike Ghost, believes that Columbus was from the city.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7374488}

He was first mentioned in contemporary sources in 1301, when he was the prince of Tropolje together with his brothers. He was also mentioned as the prince of Trogir in 1305, and of Skradin in 1311. Dissatisfied with the division of powers with his brothers, he led, together with other Croatian nobles, a rebellion against his brother, Mladen II, in a desire to gain further power.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reginald's Tower\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Reginald's Tower () is a historic tower in Waterford, Munster, Ireland. It is located at the eastern end of the city quay. The tower has been in usage for different purposes for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important remnant of its medieval urban defence system. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only urban monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.\n\nEarly history \n\nReginald's Tower was built by the Anglo-Normans after their conquest of Waterford, replacing an earlier Viking fortification. The tower's name is derived from an Anglicised form of the Irish name Raghnall, which is in turn a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse R\u00f8gnvaldr. The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. One possibility is that it refers to Ragnall Mac Gilla Muire, the last Hiberno-Norse ruler of the town. The present tower is likely to have been built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280. In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city's defences, including the tower.\n\nThe tower is 54 feet high; its horizontal cross section is circular. It is 42\u00bd feet in diameter and is surmounted by a conical roof. A spiral staircase ascends within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, tapering down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the ancient city walls of Waterford and could be considered the apex of a triangle formed by three structures \u2014 Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald\u2019s Tower at the quay and the mall. It was strategically located on the high ground between a branch of St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. The site is sometimes called Dundory (an Irish word which means \"fort of oak\"), and hence the tower is occasionally called the Dundory Tower. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which encircled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the finest examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.\n\nMedieval history \n\nThe tower has been used as a mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It occasionally served as a royal castle, and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be struck there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399 Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England he was captured by the future Henry IV and forced to abdicate.\n\nIn 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words \"Civitas Waterford\" struck on one side. In 1495, the tower\u2019s cannons successfully deterred the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day siege. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto Urbs Intacta Manet - \"Waterford remains the unconquered city\".\n\nIn 1649, Waterford was besieged by the army of the English parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city on that occasion. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is reputed to be from this siege.\n\nIn 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is said to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store munitions.

The tower is located on the south bank of the River Waterford, in the old city, and is the oldest building in the city that is still in day-to-day use. Reginald's Tower was built around the year 1000 by the Viking invaders who founded the city. It is the largest surviving building of the period. It was used as a defensive tower and a prison. The Irish name for the tower is \"Homhoradh Reginald\", which means \"Reginald's prison\". In the early 15th century, the tower was strengthened and given crenellations. The present name, \"Reginald's Tower\", comes from the member of the Butlers of Ormonde family, the Earl of Ormonde, who lived in the tower until the 17th century. The tower has four floors, which can be accessed by a narrow winding staircase. There are various exhibits on the history of Waterford and Ireland on the upper floors, including the Hall of the Dead, which features a collection of medieval artifacts found in the city. The ground floor houses the city's tourist information office. Reginald's Tower is located opposite the Bishop's Palace, which was built in 1743.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43697833}

Gau is one of the New Georgia Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Solomon Islands, although it is not one of the main islands in the Solomons group, but is located near the main island of New Georgia. It lies about 40 km (25 mi) northeast of New Georgia and is connected to it by a short stretch of water. It is also about 20 km (12 mi) northwest of the island of Rendova. Gau is a small island, only about 5 km (3.1 mi) long and 1.5 km (0.93 mi) at its widest. It has a small population of about 100 people. The island is covered in tropical rainforest and has a mountainous interior. The highest point is Mount Maravai, which is 1,530 m (5,010 ft) high. The island is home to a variety of bird species, including the gerygone, the silktail, the New Georgia honeyeater, and the Woodford's rail. Gau was the site of a significant battle in World War II. In January 1943, United States forces invaded the island as part of their campaign to capture the Solomon Islands. The invasion force, under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, included the 1st Raider Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment. The Raiders were under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Edson D. Raff, while the 2/24 was led by Lieutenant Colonel Walter Asbury Hardee. The U.S. forces were opposed by a Japanese force of about 2,000 men, under the command of Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama. The battle for Gau began on the morning of January 20, 1943, when the Raiders landed on the island. The Marines were scheduled to land soon after, but due to a miscommunication, they did not land until the afternoon. This delay gave the Japanese time to reinforce their positions on the island. The Raiders and the Marines began their attack on the island from the west, while the Japanese defenders attacked from the east. The fighting was intense, with heavy casualties on both sides. The Americans were able to push the Japanese back, and by the end of the day, they had secured most of the island. The next day, the Marines landed on the island, and the two forces began a coordinated attack on the Japanese positions. The fighting continued for several days, until the Japanese forces were finally defeated and forced to withdraw from the island. The battle for Gau was a significant victory for the Americans, as it provided a base for further operations in the Solomons. It also boosted the morale of the American forces, who had been fighting in the Pacific for several months. The Raiders and the Marines suffered heavy casualties in the battle, with about 50 men killed and another 200 wounded. The Japanese forces also suffered heavy casualties, with about 100 men killed and another 200 wounded.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3245697}

It took a Left Republican position, although it was never an official socialist organ. \nIn the years before World War I (1914\u201318) many prominent politicians contributed to the paper. The paper opposed the pact between Germany and Russia just before World War II (1939\u201345), and after the fall of France opposed the Vichy regime. However, it managed to continue publication until 1944.\n\nHistory\n\nLe Petit Proven\u00e7al was founded in Marseille in 1880, and distributed in south eastern France.\nIt was originally titled La Jeune r\u00e9publique (The Young Republic).\nThe founder was Geoffroy Velten (1831\u20131915), also called Godfried Velten, a Protestant entrepreneur and militant Republican who became a Municipal Councillor in Marseilles in 1880, and on 25 January 1883 was made Senator for Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Velten also founded L'\u00c9galit\u00e9.\nThe paper competed with others such as Le Petit Marseillais, Le Radical and Le Soleil du Midi.\nAt first the newspaper published opinions and polemics, but later it became a source of news and information.\nThus, during the campaign in Madagascar, from September 1894 to December 1896 Le Petit Proven\u00e7al devoted 95 editorials or feature articles on the front page to colonial issues.\n\nLe Petit Proven\u00e7al paper called itself a Socialist Republican newspaper, but was never the official organ of the socialists.\nBetween 1890 and 1900 it supported socialist candidates of all camps, including Guesdists.\nRegular contributors included Alexandre Millerand, Ren\u00e9 Viviani, Gustave Rouanet, Clovis Hugues and L\u00e9on Mirman.\nAndr\u00e9 Joseph Lef\u00e8vre wrote for Le Petit Proven\u00e7al in the period before World War I (1914\u201318).\nDuring the period leading up to 1914 the paper emphasized that it supported both radicals and socialists.\nThe circulation was 40,000\u201350,000 in 1902.\nWhile papers at the time usually gave false circulation figures  Le Petit Proven\u00e7al by 1913 probably had a daily circulation of about 100,000. Advertising only filled 20% or so of the pages.\n\nBy 1914 Le Petit Proven\u00e7al had a circulation of 100,000\u2013110,000 in 1914, mostly among the working-class people of Marseilles, although it also sold in the rural parts of the department and in the center of the city, where it faced fierce competition from Le Petit Marseillais.\nLe Petit Proven\u00e7al continued to take a socialist position after World War I.\nAfter the war the socialist Marcel D\u00e9at contributed to the newspaper.\nLe Petit Proven\u00e7al became the regional organ of the Left. \nOn 29 August 1939, on the eve of World War II (1939\u201345), Le Petit Proven\u00e7al called for support for the administrative commission of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail (General Confederation of Labor), which had condemned the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Germany.\n\nOn 18 June 1940 Le Petit Provencal and Le Petit Marseillais both published an appeal from General Charles de Gaulle in its entirety.\nShortly after the Vichy government of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain had been established the newspaper published an article on 18 July 1940 that listed all that had been achieved by the French Third Republic since the 1875 constitution was established. It concluded with the words, \"Vive la libert\u00e9!

It was premiered on 18 April 1845 at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris. The opera is set in the south of France, in and around Marseille. The story concerns a young man, Vincent, who is in love with a girl, Henriette, but is prevented from marrying her by his father, who prefers that he marry the much wealthier Catherine. Vincent is eventually permitted to marry Henriette, but on condition that he gives up his right to his inheritance. He agrees, but his father tricks him into signing a document that not only relinquishes his inheritance but also makes him ineligible to marry Henriette. The young man is heartbroken, but his pain is eased when his father's lawyer reveals that the signature on the document is a forgery. The father is exposed as a fraud and the young couple are free to marry. The opera was an immediate success, and was quickly revived in Paris and toured widely. Its title, \"Le Petit Proven\u00e7al\", refers to the character of Vincent, who is from Provence, and is therefore called \"le petit proven\u00e7al\" (the little Proven\u00e7al). The opera's most famous number is the barcarolle-like \"Amour, viens aider ma faiblesse\", in which the three female characters urge love to help Vincent in his hour of need.

They are currently members of the  and play at The Sportsfield.\n\nHistory\nLittlehampton F.C. was formed in 1896, adding the Town suffix in 1938. The club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896, joining the Junior Division. In 1928 the club joined the Sussex County League. Despite finishing as runners-up in Division One on six occasions, they had to wait until 1990\u201391 before lifting the championship \u2013 the only time they have done so, having finished as runners-up to Wick the previous season \u2013 clinching the title on the last day of the season, at nearest rivals Peacehaven & Telscombe.\n\nThat season was undoubtedly the finest in the Marigolds\u2019 history. As well as finishing as Division One champions, the club also reached the 1st Round of the FA Cup where they were beaten 4\u20130 by Northampton Town in front of a crowd of 4,000 at The Sportsfield. A League & Cup \u2018double\u2019 was completed with a 3\u20130 win over Burgess Hill Town. If that wasn't enough, Littlehampton also reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, which remains the furthest that any Sussex club has ever progressed in the competition.\n\nThe following season, Littlehampton finished third behind Peacehaven & Telscombe and Langney Sports (now Eastbourne Borough). However, fortunes declined to the extent that they were relegated at the end of the 1994\u201395 season.\n\nTwo seasons later Littlehampton returned to the top division as champions of Division Two, and finished runners-up to Division One champions Burgess Hill Town in 1997\u201398. Once more however, the club suffered a sustained period of mediocrity, culminating in a miserable 2002\u201303 season, including a 22\u20131 defeat at Horsham YMCA; and relegation once again, ironically with Wick and Peacehaven & Telscombe... together, the three most dominant clubs in the early 1990s.\n\nThe club responded by investing heavily in the playing squad for 2003\u201304 and began the season as hot favourites to bounce back at the first attempt. This they duly did, finishing seven points clear of runners-up Worthing United. The two clubs also met in the League Cup final, with the Marigolds again coming out on top. There was no significant difference in the average attendance from the previous wretched season.\n\nThe club were the favourites of many to secure back-to-back championships, which was probably a little too ambitious. Nevertheless, they did well to finish in a creditable 4th place, a position they occupied once again at the end of 2005\u201306. Unfortunately, and as so often appears to be the case in West Sussex, the club lost manager Carl Stabler and most of the previous season's squad during the close season (many to Wick) and from being amongst the championship favourites the previous season, were now hotly tipped as relegation fodder. That proved to be the case and the Marigolds were always struggling throughout 2006\u201307, under new manager Trevor Waller, with a largely young and inexperienced squad.\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season saw the club finish as champions of Division Two, gaining promotion to Division One.\n\nLittlehampton won the 2014\u201315 Sussex County Football League, finishing 1st.

First, he held that general revelation cannot in itself give humanity a saving knowledge of God. Although he can be known in some ways through creation he has \"added the light of his Word in order that he might make himself known unto salvation.\" Calvin compares Scripture to being like a pair of spectacles, that enable us to properly interpret what we see in creation:\nFor as the aged, or those whose sight is defective, when any book, however fair, is set before them, though they perceive that there is something written, are scarcely able to make out two consecutive words, but, when aided by glasses, begin to read distinctly, so Scripture, gathering together the impressions of Deity, which, till then, lay confused in our minds, dissipates the darkness, and shows us the true God clearly.\nSecond, Calvin held that inscripturation is necessary to avoid the errors inherent in oral transmission:\nFor if we reflect how prone the human mind is to lapse into forgetfulness of God, how readily inclined to every kind of error, how bent every now and then on devising new and fictitious religions, it will be easy to understand how necessary it was to make such a depository of doctrine as would secure it from either perishing by the neglect, vanishing away amid the errors, or being corrupted by the presumptuous audacity of men.\n\nAuthority\n\nCalvin viewed Scripture as being equivalent to an utterance of God given from heaven:\nSince no daily responses are given from heaven, and the Scriptures are the only records in which God has been pleased to consign his truth to perpetual remembrance, the full authority which they ought to possess with the faithful is not recognised, unless they are believed to have come from heaven, as directly as if God had been heard giving utterance to them.\n\nAccording to Calvin, Word and Spirit must always go together. Scripture gives us a saving knowledge of God, but only when its certainty is \"founded on the inward persuasion of the Holy Spirit.\" It is \"foolish to attempt to prove to infidels that the Scripture is the Word of God,\" since this can only be known by faith. Nevertheless, he did see a place for evidences of Scripture's authority, as long it is recognised that they are secondary:\nThe human testimonies which go to confirm it will not be without effect, if they are used in subordination to that chief and highest proof, as secondary helps to our weakness.\n\nThe \"chief and highest proof\" being, of course, the testimony of the Holy Spirit, though Calvin does not say that the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit is the source of this authority. John Murray has suggested that the distinction between the authority intrinsic to Scripture, and our persuasion that it is authoritative is not \"as clearly formulated in Calvin as we might desire.\"\n\nCharacter\nCalvin viewed Scripture as being both majestic  and simple. According to Ford Lewis Battles, Calvin had discovered that \"sublimity of style and sublimity of thought were not coterminous.\"\n\nMajesty\n\nCalvin believed that Scripture possesses \"a divine majesty which will subdue our presumptuous opposition, and force us to do it homage.\" It speaks with a unified voice, and its parts make up a perfect harmony:\nHow admirably the system of divine wisdom contained in it is arranged\u2014how perfectly free the doctrine is from every thing that savours of earth\u2014how beautifully it harmonises in all its parts\u2014and how rich it is in all the other qualities which give an air of majesty to composition.\n\nSimplicity\nScripture, according to Calvin, also has an \"unpolished simplicity\". It is not particularly eloquent, for that would detract from its message:\nThe sublime mysteries of the kingdom of heaven have for the greater part been delivered with a contemptible meanness of words. Had they been adorned with a more splendid eloquence, the wicked might have cavilled, and alleged that this constituted all their force. But now, when an unpolished simplicity, almost bordering on rudeness, makes a deeper impression than the loftiest flights of oratory, what does it indicate if not that the Holy Scriptures are too mighty in the power of truth to need the rhetorician\u2019s art?\n\nSee also \n\n Accommodation (religion)\n John Calvin bibliography\n Theology of John Calvin\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n \n\nCalvinist theology\nChristian theology of the Bible\nScripture", "machine_text": " John Calvin's view of Scripture John Calvin's view of the Bible is derived from his belief that God is the author of all of creation, including the words of the Bible, and that as a result the Bible is a collection of God's revealed knowledge. Calvin wrote, \"All the content of our religion, however, consists in the knowledge of God and of ourselves, and in the comprehension of the reciprocal relation between us.\"[1] For Calvin, this knowledge of God and of ourselves is revealed in the Bible. In his view, the Bible contains the divinely inspired words of God, but the words do not necessarily correspond to specific divine meanings. Rather, they are words which God has chosen to use in order to reveal himself to humanity and to teach humanity about himself and about how to live righteously in a fallen world. Thus, the words of the Bible are \"the very words of God,\" but their meaning is not always straightforward and can be difficult to determine.[2] Calvin recognized the difficulties involved in determining the meaning of the Bible. In response to these difficulties, Calvin proposed that the Bible be interpreted according to the \"analogy of faith.\" This analogy of faith is based on the idea that the Bible is a product of God's revelation, and that as a result, it has a internal logic to it which can be discovered by the reader.[3] In other words, the meaning of the Bible is not arbitrary, but is rather a coherent whole which can be discovered through careful reading and consideration of the text. The key to understanding Calvin's view of the Bible is the idea that the Bible is a book which is both divine and human. That is to say, the Bible is a book which is inspired by God and which also contains the words and thoughts of human beings. As a result, the Bible is a unique book which is greater than the sum of its parts, and which has a internal logic which is both divine and human in origin.[4]", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10491581}

Gond completed her high schooling from Manohar Kanya High School, Janwar and is an Adivasi. When Ulrike Reinhard came up with the idea and created the skatepark in the village in 2015, Gond was one of many children who began to learn and practice skateboarding. The students had no formal training and learned from YouTube videos. Due to the rules laid down by Reinhard, the children were not distracted from their studies, gave girls the first priority with the few skateboards available, and did not discriminate on the basis of caste. Gond still faced insults and threats from her fellow villagers, who believed that she should continue with the regressive traditions imposed on the women of the village.\n\nIn 2016, Reinhard helped crowdfund Gond's education in the English language at The Butler Centre for Education in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, about  from Oxford. Gond had initially dropped out of school after Class XI. She became the first child in her village to travel abroad.\n\nGond also went on to participate in many national level skateboarding competitions and was India's only female skateboarder at the 2018 World Skateboarding Championship, held in Nanjing, China. She also co-founded and runs Barefoot Skateboarders, a non-profit organisation working to improve the education and development of the children in Janwar village. She has also been featured skateboarding in a TV advertisement for tyres.\n\nFollowing the release of the trailer of Skater Girl, netizens familiar with the story of Reinhard and Gond found striking similarities between the movie and Gond's life. While Gond was interviewed as part of the production of the film, director Manjari Makijany denied that the movie was about Gond.\n\nReferences\n\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nIndian sportspeople\nLiving people", "machine_text": " Asha Gond, also known as Asha Kaushik, (born 1974) is an Indian artist and photographer based in Delhi.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fortified position of Li\u00e8ge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The fortified position of Li\u00e8ge ( [PFL]) was established after the First World War by Belgium to block the traditional invasion corridor through Belgium between Germany and France. In the First World War the Belgian Army held up the Germans for a week at Li\u00e8ge, delaying the German invasion of France, caused Belgium to consider a similar defensive strategy. Belgium rebuilt the Li\u00e8ge fortifications and extended them onto the Pays de Herve (Herve plateau) closer to Germany, using the most advanced fortification technology available.\n\nThe PFL was divided into the modern defensive line, anchored on the Albert Canal by Fort Eben-Emael and extending to the south through a planned five additional forts, designated PFL I and the ring of forts around Li\u00e8ge. Li\u00e8ge commanded crucial road and rail crossings of the Meuse and was as strategically important in the 1930s as in 1914. The modernized Li\u00e8ge forts were called PFL II.\n\nIn 1936, Belgium's neutrality was proclaimed again by King Leopold III of Belgium in a vain attempt to forestall another invasion, preventing France from being able to make use of the Belgian defences and territory in the forward defence of France. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Belgian defences had to resist alone until France could advance into Belgium after its neutrality had been violated. Again the fortifications could not hold the Germans.\n\nBackground\n\nWhen Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, it inherited four lines of Napoleonic forts called the Wellington Barrier that the state could not and did not want to maintain. The forts faced France, a nation that Belgium had fought for its independence alongside. The dismantling of the Wellington Barrier forts began in 1839, but after the Revolutions of 1848 and the establishment of the Second French Empire in 1851, Belgium faced the possibility of invasion by France. Belgian leaders sought a new defensive strategy and struggled with popular anti-military sentiment or opposing commercial interests regarding existing forts, but settled by 1859 on a plan championed by Belgian general . Beginning in 1847, Chazal called for Antwerp to be fortified and expanded into the National Redoubt as a fallback stronghold for the Belgian Army. The task of constructing the National Redoubt was given to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Chazal, Captain Henri Alexis Brialmont. Brialmont completed the National Redoubt in 1868, but technological advancements in artillery and another change in the geopolitical landscape of Europe again rendered Belgium's defensive strategy inadequate.\n\nThe Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 had enormous geopolitical consequences for Belgium. A now-united Germany in the German Empire had annexed Alsace-Lorraine from France and thus ensured another war between the two nations. The new path for French or German soldiers into each other's nations was through the lightly defended Meuse river valley \u2013 through lightly defended southern Belgium and the unfortified French border. According to Chazal's doctrine, the forts of the Meuse were to be the fulcrum and crossing points for the army at Antwerp. At that moment, those fortresses numbered two: the citadels of Li\u00e8ge and Namur, which together controlled 18 out of 26 crossing over the Meuse. Within Li\u00e8ge alone were seventeen roads with twelve bridges over the Meuse and three train stations linking seven rail lines. The heights near the city commanded not only the nearby Herve and Hesbaye plains, but a  gap between Li\u00e8ge and the Dutch border. For over a decade following the Franco-Prussian War, several Belgian Ministers of War and even Otto von Bismarck urged the fortification of the Meuse. In 1882, Prime Minister Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban finally commissioned draft plans for fortresses to be built at Li\u00e8ge and Namur, and the strategically important crossings at Vis\u00e9 and Huy.\n\nBrialmont was tasked with those drafts, but again political debate slowed the militarization of the Meuse until 31 December 1886, when Brialmont was invited to conduct another study. He finished and presented his report on 15 January 1887, calling for a system of military installations around Li\u00e8ge and Namur similar to the one he built around Antwerp. His plans were approved on 1 February 1887, but political squabbling delayed the passing of a budget for Brialmont to June 1887.\n\nDesign and construction\n\nBy the 1870s, technological advances in artillery such as rifling, melinite, and delayed fuzes, had given it greater range, accuracy, and destructive power. Bastion forts \u2013 the tradition in European military architecture for a century \u2013 had become obsolete. In response to artillery's increased reach, military architects began in the 1850s to build detached polygonal forts farther away from cities to protect them from bombardment. To counter its new destructive power, architects began making those forts more durable.\n\nIn 1887, French military engineer Henri-Louis-Philippe Mougin produced plans for a \"fort of the future\" (Fort de l'Avenir) that would be mostly underground, be built of concrete, and be armed with artillery in retractable steel gun turrets. Concrete, invented early in the 19th century, was found to be much more resistant to new artillery shells and following its use in the upgrading of the S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system in 1887 it became the standard building material for fortresses. The success of ironclad warships in the Crimean War inspired the other innovations of Mougin's design: gun turrets and metal armour. The initial strides in this field were made by Germans Hermann Gruson and , but Frenchmen like Mougin himself perfected fort gun turrets and made them retractable using counterweights. The Swiss built a prototype of Mougin's fort , as did the French , near Verdun. Mougin's plan was never adopted by the French military, but Brialmont was likely familiar with it.\n\nAt Li\u00e8ge, 12 forts \u2013 six small and six large \u2013 were to be placed in a ring  from the city. The circumference of the city's fortress ring was about , with a gap of around  between some of the forts, held by intermediate works. The ring forts were placed away from ravines or depressions that could conceal attackers. There was also to be a fort at Vis\u00e9 to guard its ford over the Meuse, and at Huy, half-way between Li\u00e8ge and Namur. Construction of the Meuse forts was first estimated to cost 24 million francs, and this was the sum given to Brialmont on 1 June 1887 even before his geological surveys were complete. To his consternation, no funds were allotted for Vis\u00e9 or Huy, and Brialmont had to economize his plans for the forts he could build. His forts had two traces, a triangular or a trapezoidal shape, depending on the terrain, and their structures were similarly regimented. There were three plans for the gorges and two for the central bunker, its casemates, and connecting galleries. The Meuse fortresses would be the first to be built entirely of concrete. The 'base' of a fort faced Li\u00e8ge, as did its entry ramp. During the battle of Li\u00e8ge, the fortress ring was bolstered with the addition of 31 redoubts and 63 trenches, behind and in front of the forts and surrounded by barbed wire.\n\nThe Belgian government awarded the contract to build the forts on 1 July 1888 to the French firm Hallier, Letellier Brothers, and Jules Barratoux. Construction began on 28 July 1888 with the clearing and excavation of the sites and building of storage and work structures. Work was finished three years later, on 29 October 1891, and cost \u20a371,600,000. Around Li\u00e8ge, workers excavated  of earth, poured  of concrete, and laid  of brick.\n\nProtection\n\nBrialmont designed the Meuse forts to withstand the power of the heaviest artillery of his day:  pieces whose shells put out  of force. As a response to the 1886 melinite tests, he covered the masonry in the walls with a thick layer of concrete which itself was then covered with  of soil. The mixtures of concrete used, of which there were two, were determined by testing at the . Concrete was poured into wooden frames and left in place for over two weeks. Once dry, mortar would be brushed over the concrete until smoothed on the interior, and covered in soil on the exterior. The vulnerability of a structure determined the thickness of the concrete protecting it; the gorge wall of a barrack was  thick, while the exposed top of the massif was  thick. Protection against infantry was offered by a sea of barbed wire on the glacis around the ditch and the casemates of the gorge, housing 5.7\u00a0cm cannons and garrison infantry. These troops were also to be mustered in the massif for a sortie in case of a hostile infantry assault.\n\nThe German siege artillery that engaged the Meuse forts in World War I generated an excess of  of force. Compounding the deficit between modern artillery and the Meuse forts was that concrete could not be poured at night because of a lack of illumination equipment. Left to dry overnight, concrete poured the day before would not fully bond with the concrete of the next day. The consequences of this were severe. The explosion that annihilated the Fort de Loncin in August 1914 dislocated many different layers of concrete, resulting in immense damage to the entire fort. The relative thinness of the gorge front concrete would allow the Belgian Army to, in the event of a fort's capture, shell it from the city\u2014from behind. The concrete and armour around the windows would be thus eroded until shells were exploding inside the barracks, forcing the garrison deeper within. The Imperial German Army, by entering Li\u00e8ge and Namur while attacking their forts, were able to do exactly this and to devastating effect.\n\nArmament\n\nThe Meuse forts were armed with a total of 171 gun turrets, whose manufacture, transportation, and installation cost \u20a324,210,775 in total. They were made of steel and placed in a concrete well in the massif or main redoubt. A turret itself sat on top a set of rollers, allowing it to turn 360\u00b0, and moved up and down its well with tracks running the length of the well. While smaller turrets could completely retract into the fortress, larger-calibre guns could not because of the length of their barrels. A steel collar protected the lip of the turret well and to prevent the displacement of the turret in case the nearby concrete was damaged. In October 1912, however, a cycle of artillery tests held in Russia and attended by Belgian officials showed that collar to be ineffective. 15\u00a0cm shells could jam a turret in place, while 28\u00a0cm shells could entirely dislodge them.\n\nThe turret and the guns within were moved, aimed, and fired from within the turret. This was done either by an observer within the turret directly, or indirectly with the use of a graduated ring that showed 1/20ths of a degree. According to Brialmont's specifications, a gun turret should make a complete rotation in 1.5 minutes, and three rotations in five minutes. Once the right angle and elevation was found, a brake was engaged to hold the turret in place. Ordinance was hoisted in a basket with a manual elevator to the gun, which was fitted with a hydraulic recoil brake containing a solution that was 80% glycerine and 20% water. The turret was kept under negative pressure using a manual ventilator to expel fumes from the gun and to keep fumes from incoming shells out of the fort. In case of a malfunction, a gun could be removed and replaced within a few hours. Munitions were held beneath the turrets in separate form, and without cartridge casings for larger-calibre guns and in a complete shell for 5.7\u00a0cm guns. Every one of the Meuse forts' guns used black powder and were never modified to use a smokeless alternative.\n\nThe smallest artillery employed in the Meuse forts was the  Nordenfelt cannon, used against attacking infantry at close range. These were usually mounted on a wheeled triangular carriage but sometimes also in turret form. In large forts, there were nine 5.7\u00a0cm guns in casemates \u2013 two in each gorge casemate, four in the head casemate, and one in the casemate guarding the entry ramp. In small forts, there were also nine 5.7\u00a0cm guns. Four were placed in gorge ditch casemates near the entrance, while another defended the ramp. Every trapezoidal fort had two of their nine 5.7\u00a0cm guns in the casemaste defending the fourth angle of the fort. Large forts had four 5.7\u00a0cm turrets, while small forts had three. These all contained a single gun, crewed by six men, and exclusively fired grapeshot. The casemate guns were produced by Cockerill and Krupp, while the turret versions were manufactured by Gruson.\n\nThe rest of a fort's armament was contained in turrets and its makeup depended on its size. Large forts received a single two-gun 15\u00a0cm turret, two two-gun 12\u00a0cm turrets, and two one-gun 21\u00a0cm turrets. Small forts had two one-gun 12\u00a0cm turrets and a one-gun 21\u00a0cm turret. These were produced by Gruson, Creusot, Saint-Chamond, , and Chatillon-Commentry. Additional guns were supplied by Marcinelle-Couillet, but only at the Fort de Boncelles and the large forts at Namur, and by Vanderkerhove, but only for Li\u00e8ge's large forts. All of the forts possessed a 60\u00a0cm searchlight in a turret produced by Ateliers de la Meuse.\n\nGarrison and utilities\nThe Meuse forts were garrisoned by a mix of infantry, artillerymen, engineers, and support staff. During peacetime, they lived in temporary wooden barracks. During hostilities, the garrison dismantled those barracks and moved into the gorge caserne, eight to twelve men to a room. Power was supplied by a steam engine apparatus in the lower levels of a fort's massif, although petrol lamps lit most of a fort. About  of coal and  of petroleum were stored within a fort. The primary means of communication between the forts were above-ground telegraph or telephone fires operated by civilians. Latrines were poorly planned and ventilation nonexistent, except at the Fort de Loncin. The drainage system was also poorly designed. Water was pulled from underground wells or collected during and after rains in a cistern to be used by the fort. During the battle of Li\u00e8ge, shell fire created debris that blocked the water pipes to the engine room, or flooded the munitions rooms and living areas.\n\nWorld War I\n\nWar came in 1914, and Li\u00e8ge became the early focus of German attack on the way to France. The forts were known to have shortcomings in their ability to resist heavy artillery, and had never been modernised. During the battle of Li\u00e8ge the forts were pounded by heavy German artillery of 21\u00a0cm, 28\u00a0cm and 42\u00a0cm. The forts had never been designed to resist such heavy artillery. The bombardment exposed the forts' shortcomings in living arrangements, sanitation, ventilation, construction and protection, culminating with the explosion of the Fort de Loncin under bombardment. Even before this the forts had begun to surrender one by one as they became uninhabitable and unable to respond to attack. German forces defeated the troops assigned to defend the intervals between forts, penetrating to Li\u00e8ge and taking it before the first fort had surrendered.\n\nThe forts' mission was to delay the progress of an enemy for the time required for the Belgian Army to mobilise. Left to themselves, the forts were planned to resist a siege for about a month, based on estimates made in 1888. In 1914 the forts were completely outclassed by the much more powerful German artillery, which included the enormous Big Bertha 42\u00a0cm howitzer. It was therefore a surprise that the forts resisted as long and as successfully as they did. However, the forts' poor ability to deal with powder gases, pulverized dust and the stench from inadequate sanitary facilities became a determining factor in the endurance of the forts' garrisons. None of the forts, apart from the Fort de Loncin, possessed forced ventilation.\n\nThe Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This had profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. These service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e. in the face towards Li\u00e8ge), with lesser protection than  the two \"salient\" sides. This arrangement was calculated to place a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and in an age where mechanical ventilation was in its infancy, allowed natural ventilation of living quarters and support areas. However, the concept proved disastrous in practice. Heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear. The massive German bombardments drove men into the central massif, where there were insufficient sanitary facilities for 500 men, rendering the air unbreathable, while the German artillery destroyed the forts from above and from the rear.\n\nBattle of Li\u00e8ge \n\nThe Li\u00e8ge fortifications fulfilled their role, stopping the German Army long enough to allow the Belgian and French Armies to mobilize. The battle revealed shortcomings in the performance of the forts and in the Belgian strategy. The forts themselves suffered from inherent weakness of construction through poor understanding of concrete technology, as well as overall inadequate protection for the garrison and ammunition stores from heavy-caliber artillery bombardment. Unbreathable air from bombardment, the fort's own gun gases and from human waste compelled the surrender of most of the positions.\n\nPosition Fortifi\u00e9e de Li\u00e8ge (PFL) \nThe Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge was conceived by a commission charged with recommending options for the rebuilding of Belgium's defences. The 1927 report recommended the construction of a line of new fortifications to the east of the Meuse. Work was seriously delayed by budget crises, forcing work on all fortifications but Eben-Emael to be delayed. Work finally began on the forts at Battice, Aubin-Neufch\u00e2teau and Tancr\u00e9mont in 1933. Two other planned positions were never pursued, with Aubin-Neufch\u00e2teau taking over the role of forts planned at Mauhin and Les Waides. There were five layers to the system:\n Positions avanc\u00e9es: 66 small bunkers positioned close to the border as a delaying position.\n PFL I: Four modern forts supported by 178 bunkers.\n PFL II: The southern and eastern portions of the Brialmont fortress ring around Li\u00e8ge, modernized and provided with interval bunkers and anti-tank obstacles. There were 62 infantry shelters and 6 forts in this section.\n PFL III: Small fortifications defending three crossings of the Meuse, comprising 42 bunkers on the eastern side of the river.\n PFL IV: Three layers of defences on the west side of the Meuse, comprising a line on the Meuse with 31 bunkers, a line on the Albert Canal with nine bunkers, and ten bunkers with the Forts de Pontisse and Fl\u00e9malle.\n\nPFL II\nThe Belgians initially rebuilt eight forts of the ring to the south and east of Li\u00e8ge, with later work on the west side of the fortress ring. It was not possible to repair the Fort de Loncin, which had been completely destroyed. The improvements addressed the shortcomings revealed by the battle of Li\u00e8ge, allowing the fortress ring to be a backstop to the primary line of fortifications farther east.  The Li\u00e8ge ring was designated PFL II, although the forts on the west side of the river were part of PFL IV.\n\nImprovements included replacing 21\u00a0cm howitzers with longer-range 15\u00a0cm guns, 150mm howitzers with 120mm guns, and adding machine guns. Generating plants, ventilation, sanitation and troop accommodations were improved, as well as communications.  The work incorporated alterations that had already been made by the Germans during their occupation of the forts in World War I. Most notably, the upgraded forts received defended air intake towers, intended to look like water towers, that could function as observation posts and emergency exits.\n\nPFL I\nFour new forts were built about  to the east of Li\u00e8ge, of a planned six. In contrast to the ring of forts protecting Li\u00e8ge, the new fortification line was similar in concept to the French Maginot Line: a series of positions in a line along the frontier, intended to prevent an enemy advance into Belgian territory, rather than to defend a specific strong point. This new line was designated PFL I, the primary defence line against an advance from Germany, as well as a German advance through Dutch territory at Maastricht. Fort Eben-Emael was positioned to defend the water obstacle of the Albert Canal and to anchor the northern end of the line, with a field of fire all the way north to Maastricht. The Fort de Battice occupied the second strategic point on the main road and rail lines from Aachen. The forts de Tancr\u00e9mont and Aubin-Neufch\u00e2teau filled in the intervals. The cancelled Fort de Sougn\u00e9-Remouchamps was to be similar to the smaller forts, while plans for two small forts at Comblain-du-Pont and Les Waides were abandoned early in the planning process. The big forts had as many as 2000 men, the smaller 600.\n\nWhile the organization  of the overall defensive line mimicked the Maginot Line, the design of the individual forts was conservative.  In contrast to the French fortifications, distributed along a single main gallery in the fort palm\u00e9 concept, the Belgian forts remained a set of powerfully-armed, tightly grouped combat blocks surrounded by a defended ditch. Eben-Emael and Battice featured 120mm gun turrets with a range of , and all four forts were equipped with 75mm gun turrets () and French 81mm mortars in pit emplacements.  Eben-Emael, with its site along the artificial cliff of the Albert Canal cutting, was the only fort to be equipped with artillery casemates.  The sheer face also provided a naturally-defended location for the fort's air intakes. The new forts featured extreme levels of concrete and armour protection, with between  and  of concrete cover and up to  of armour on turrets. Learning from World War I, the intervals between forts were liberally supplied with observation positions and infantry shelters.\n\nSecond World War battles \nThe Belgian command was counting on Eben-Emael to be the key defense of the northern frontier at Li\u00e8ge. It naturally attracted the first German attacks. Its enormous dimensions dictated an unconventional attack strategy, using airborne troops. The fort was attacked on 10 May 1940 and rendered ineffective in a few hours by a team of 75 men armed with new shaped-charge explosives. Ineffective Belgian defense of the fort's surface allowed the German assault team to use their explosive charges to destroy or render the fort's gun turrets and machine gun cloches uninhabitable.\n\nWith Eben-Emael out of action, the Germans could attack the other new forts with more conventional means, continuing attacks from 10 May. The forts of both PFL I and II attempted to support each other with covering fire, but to little effect. The PFL I forts quickly fell, with Battice and Aubin-Neufch\u00e2teau surrendering on 22 May. Tancr\u00e9mont was bypassed.\n\nThe PFL II forts were assaulted starting 12 May after Belgian field forces retreated from Li\u00e8ge. Isolated, the forts fought on. Fort de Fl\u00e9malle came under air attack on 15 May, surrendering the next day. On 18 May Fort de Barchon was assaulted by the same infantry battalion that had attacked Eben-Emael, supported by a 420mm howitzer. The fort surrendered the same day, as did Fl\u00e9ron and Pontisse. Evengn\u00e9e surrendered on 20 May. The other forts to the south were bypassed and surrendered on 28 May, part of the general Belgian surrender.  Tancr\u00e9mont held out until the next day, the last fort to surrender.\n\nDuring the Second World War Eben-Emael was abandoned, apart from use for propaganda films and weapons effects experiments, including armor-piercing shells. Battice and Aubin-Neufch\u00e2teau were also used for these experiments.\n\nPresent day \n\nOf the dozen Brialmont forts, seven are open to the public and may be visited \u2013 Loncin, Lantin,  Fl\u00e9malle, Hollogne, Pontisse, Barchon and Embourg. Chaudfontaine may also be visited under certain circumstances, but has not been rehabilitated. The Fort de Loncin has since the explosion of 15 August 1914, been a military cemetery and memorial. The Fort de Lantin has been extensively restored, and since it was not re-armed between the wars, it presents the appearance of an 1888 fort.\n\nOther forts have been partially buried (Fl\u00e9ron, Boncelles) and are not visitable, apart from the air intake tower of Boncelles. Others are supply depots for the Belgian Army.\n\nThe four inter-war forts are in varying states of preservation, though all may be visited. Tancr\u00e9mont is notably intact, with all equipment present. Eben-Emael and the others remain military property, but Eben-Emael is administered by the Association Fort Eben-Emael as a museum.\n\nSee also \n National Redoubt (Belgium)\n Fortified position of Namur\n Battle of Li\u00e8ge\n Battle of Belgium\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n Centre Li\u00e9geois d\u2019Histoire et d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie  Militaire \n Indexe des Fortifications Belges at fortiff.be \n Fort Eben-Emael \"Fortissimus\" site\n  Fort de Tancr\u00e9mont \n\nFortifications in Belgium", "machine_text": " Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge The Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge (French: Position Fortifi\u00e9e de Li\u00e8ge) was a network of Belgian and German fortresses and fortified positions in the provinces of Liege and Namur, on the border between Belgium and Germany. It was constructed by Belgium from 1935 to 1940, and by Germany from 1940 to 1944. The Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge was part of the Maginot Line, a series of French and Belgian fortresses and defensive positions constructed after the First World War to protect against a future German invasion. It was also part of the \"Atlantic Wall\", a similar series of German fortresses and positions constructed after the Second World War to protect against an Allied invasion. The Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge was the most important part of the Maginot Line to be captured by German forces during the Battle of Belgium. The fort was taken by the Germans on 6 September 1944, after a heavy and costly siege by the German First Army, which had taken over the defensive duties in the area after the withdrawal of the 15th Army in early September. The Germans had huge amounts of artillery and ammunition and were able to use poison gas. The fort finally surrendered after sustaining heavy casualties and the loss of all its remaining artillery. The garrison of the fort was made up of Belgian and French forces, as well as a significant number of African and Asian soldiers from the French colonies. After its capture, the Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge was used as a prison by the Germans. Many of the fort's inmates were political prisoners, including the German writer and poet Carl von Ossietzky, who died in the fort's hospital in 1938.

It was named for Methodist bishop George Whitefield (1714 - 1770).\n\nHistory\nAt the time of its founding, the community that became Whitefield was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory.\n\nWhitefield's history can be traced to the American Civil War, when the Confederate Army established Camp Pike for two thousand  Confederate soldiers in 1861. The camp was named for Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike, who had persuaded the Five Civilized Tribes to ally with the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Camp Pike became a Choctaw trading post. The trading post and the adjacent community were renamed as Oklahoma, Indian Territory. Its clientele were not only members of the Choctaw tribe, but also white settlers who had permits from the tribe to farm land in the Choctaw Nation. Occasionally, it was patronized by white outlaws such as Belle Starr, who were hiding from the law in the mountains of southern Oklahoma.The Post Office wanted to change the name because of confusion with another post office already known as Oklahoma Station. In 1888, the local residents voted to accept Whitfield as the name of the settlement and post office.  The post office at Whitefield, Indian Territory, which had originally been established as Oklahoma, Indian Territory on December 21, 1881, was reestablished on November 27, 1888.  It was named for Bishop George Whitefield, an early-day Methodist leader.\n\nWhitefield existed primarily as a town to support the nearby farms. By 1911, it counted approximately 500 residents.

Cates commented on this by stating that the app had been developed for free, and that the first foodbank to use it had not been charged. After the app was expanded to other foodbanks, there was a set-up charge which was used to help cover development and training costs, and that by joining the app they also received a complimentary subscription to JustGiving.

He arranged \"Loch Lomond\" and \"Annie Laurie\" for Maxine Sullivan.\n\nDuring the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz.\n\nIn 1939, he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill's and Gil Evans's arrangements. The band played without vibrato, so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill's sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band's most successful records were \"Snowfall\", \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", and \"Love for Love\".\n\nThornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for $10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist.\n\nIn 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the Judy, Jill and Johnny variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946\u20131947.\n\nIn 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett's musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nThornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nCompositions \n\nThornhill's compositions included the standard \"Snowfall\", \"I Wish I Had You\", recorded by Billie Holiday and Fats Waller, \"Let's Go\", \"Shore Road\", \"Portrait of a Guinea Farm\", \"Lodge Podge\", \"Rustle of Spring\", \"It's Time for Us to Part\", \"It Was a Lover and His Lass\", \"The Little Red Man\", \"Memory of an Island\", and \"Where Has My Little Dog Gone?\"\n\nCover versions of \"Snowfall\"\nThornhill's 1941 piano composition \"Snowfall\", later had lyrics written by his wife, Ruth Thornhill.

He is best known for his innovative use of voicing and his use of the cool jazz sound, although he also performed traditional bebop, and his music was adaptable to big band arrangements. Thornhill was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to a Canadian mother and an American father. The family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1929. He began studying piano at the age of six, and attended Los Angeles City College from 1942 to 1944, where he studied music. In 1944, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the Pacific Theater of World War II. After the war, Thornhill returned to Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied music under Arnold Schoenberg and Jerry Goldsmith. He played with several jazz bands in Los Angeles, including those of Johnny Otis and Gene Krupa, and recorded with the Ray Noble Orchestra in 1949. He also played with his own small band at various clubs in Los Angeles, and recorded an album for the Los Angeles-based jazz label, Imperial Records. In 1950, Thornhill joined the band of Alvino Rey, and the two of them began a collaboration that would last for several years. The band played at the respective hotels of the Rat Pack's Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, and Thornhill also played with the band at the wedding of Joseph P. Kennedy andJacqueline Bouvier. In 1955, Thornhill and his wife, Barbara, had a daughter, Cristina. Thornhill left Rey in 1957 and formed his own band, which was often billed as \"Claude Thornhill and His Orchestra\". The band's first performance was on January 1, 1958, at the Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica, California, with its first album, A Cloud in His Head, being released in June 1958. The band, which played in a cool jazz style, consisted of about twenty musicians, including five saxophones, four trumpets, three trombones, and a full rhythm section. It released a number of albums on the Dot label, a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, including The Claude Thornhill Sextet, which featured a sextet of the band's musicians. Thornhill's band was one of the few white jazz bands of the period to have a permanent black musician in its ranks: Ralph Glenn, who played second trumpet. Thornhill also hired black musicians as guests, including Lionel Hampton, Percy Faith, and Jimmy Cleveland. The band's music was also distinctive for its use of counterpoint and its unusual voicing, which featured a strong rhythm section and three trumpets. Thornhill's band was one of the few jazz bands to have a full-time arrangement and transcription staff, which was headed by a young Don Sebesky. The band's arrangements were written by Sebesky, Paul Weston, and Thornhill's wife, Barbara. The band's album, The Claude Thornhill Orchestra Plays the Music of Arthur Schwartz, which was released in 1959, was arranged by Sebesky and won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by an Orchestra. In 1961, Thornhill signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, and his band recorded a number of albums for the label, including Great Plains, which featured a collaboration with singer Sue Allen. The band also recorded an album, At the Golden Circle Copenhagen, in Denmark, and played at the White House on several occasions. In the mid-1960s, Thornhill's band was one of the first to experiment with the use of electronic instruments, including the electric piano, the guitar-synthesizer, and the therevox. In 1967, Thornhill retired from performing and began a second career as a composer and conductor of film and television scores. He also composed the theme music for the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. Thornhill died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 70.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 340950}

She attended high school in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, and a boarding school in Queluz to the west of Lisbon. She began her career as a journalist and writer at the children's newspaper O Papagaio. In 1941, she started working at R\u00e1dio Renascen\u00e7a, a station owned by the Catholic Church. Beginning as a secretary she graduated to being an announcer. Later, she worked at the magazine Modas & Bordados, a supplement of the O S\u00e9culo newspaper. The magazine was edited by Maria Lamas, a leading feminist. In 1946, when Lamas was appointed president of the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (National Council of Portuguese Women - CNMP), Lopes de Almeida became editor of that magazine and also wrote short stories and reports for the magazine O S\u00e9culo Ilustrado.

A year later she was one of the early supporters of the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), a quasi-legal organization set up after World War II in opposition to the Portuguese Estado Novo dictatorship. She became active with the CNMP until its closure by the Estado Novo in 1947. In 1962, she was dismissed from Modas & Bordados for political reasons, having signed a petition against the colonial war in Africa. Because of the danger of arrest for publishing articles hostile to the government, she began to write using pseudonyms. In 1968 she went to Paris, sending back reports to O S\u00e9culo about Portuguese emigrants in the city who were opponents of the regime. In 1969 she was a candidate for the Comiss\u00e3o Eleitoral de Unidade Democr\u00e1tica (Electoral Commission for Democratic Unity - CEUD) for the national assembly, although with no hope of success as the elections were controlled by the Estado Novo.\n\nMember of parliament\nAfter the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, which overthrew the Estado Novo, Lopes de Almeida headed Radiodifus\u00e3o Portuguesa Internacional, visiting several Portuguese communities abroad as part of her work.

Literature of the palace, so called divan literature used Ottoman Turkish, a language which extensively borrowed words and phrases from Persian and Arabic. This language was not used in daily speech and was not intelligible for most of the population. Conversely, the folklore literature used everyday language which was Turkish with a minimum number of words borrowed from other languages. The best known examples of folklore literature were poems named ko\u015fma. A special type of ko\u015fma was varsa\u011f\u0131 which can be described as epic ko\u015fma.\n\nBiography\nDadalo\u011flu lived in the mountainous areas of south Anatolia (Nur Mountains and possibly Toros Mountains). His name was Veli. Dadalo\u011flu was his mahlas (pseudonym). He was a member of a nomadic Turkmen tribe named Afshar tribe. Ottoman government in the first half of the nineteenth century decided to settle down the nomadic tribes to end the tension between the nomadic tribes and the settled people. They were given agricultural land. But most of the tribe members preferred traditional nomadic life style and struggled against the Ottoman high commander. Dadalo\u011flu was also in the struggle and in his varsa\u011f\u0131 poems, he reflected the feelings and the reactions of his people. In his verse,\n\nFerman padi\u015fah\u0131n, Da\u011flar bizimdir...\n Decree is Sultan's, mountains are ours...\n\nAfter a period of struggle, finally Ottoman government persuaded most of the tribes to adopt a sedentary life. The new home was in Central Anatolia. Dadalo\u011flu died in the village of Ziyaret Tepe in Kaman district of Kirsehir Province.\n\nStyle\nAlthough he is known as a varsa\u011f\u0131 poet, he also produced ko\u015fmas in other types. He usually used 8 or 11 syllabic meter. As it is true with other folk poets he used his pseudonym in the last verse.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nMale poets of the Ottoman Empire\nTurkish-language poets\n1868 deaths\nYear of birth uncertain\nNomads\n1785 births\nEthnic Afshar people", "machine_text": " Dadalo\u011flu is a Turkish word that refers to a person who is the first born of a set of twins. The word is unique to the Turkish language, and its usage is not well documented. However, it is believed to have originated in the Ottoman Empire, and it has been used in Turkey and other Turkish-speaking countries for centuries. The word dadalo\u011flu is derived from the Turkish words \"dede\" (meaning \"elder\" or \"senior\") and \"o\u011flu\" (meaning \"son\" or \"child\"). It is used to describe a person who is the first born of a set of twins, and it is usually used in a complimentary manner. The second born of a set of twins is called the \"kocy\u0131\" (meaning \"younger\"). In some regions of Turkey, it is believed that the first born of a set of twins has special powers, such as the ability to see the future or to communicate with the dead. In some areas, the first born is believed to be the leader of the twins, and the second born is believed to be the follower.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"SS Ste. Claire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "SS Ste. Claire is a steamer located in Detroit, Michigan.  Built in 1910, she was one of the last propeller-driven excursion steamers to be operated on the Great Lakes.  She was declared a US National Historic Landmark in 1992. In 2018, a devastating fire destroyed the upper decks, leaving only the steel structure.\n\nHistory\nThe Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was incorporated in 1881 to provide ferry service between Detroit, Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit's Belle Isle Park. In 1898, the company began leasing Bois Blanc Island (later known as \"Bob-Lo\") and began offering ferry service to the island. Bois Blanc became a popular day trip destination, with picnic grounds, a small amusement area, dancing and other services. In 1901, the company purchased a large part of the island. Service to Bob-Lo became so popular that in 1902, the company hired Frank E. Kirby to design a passenger excursion steamer, . However, passenger volume continued to increase, and soon the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company commissioned another, slightly smaller steamer. This ship was again designed by Frank E. Kirby, and constructed at the Toledo Shipbuilding Company.\n\nThe Ste. Claire was launched at Toledo Shipbuilding Company in 1910, and entered service later that year between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island.  In 1911, the Detroit, Belle Isle, & Windsor Ferry Company was reorganized as the  Detroit and Windsor Ferry Company. However, the construction in the 1920s of the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor, and the MacArthur Bridge to Belle Isle drastically reduced the company's service, and by the late 1930s their only activity was the Detroit-Bob-Lo Island line. In the early 1940s, the company was renamed simply the \"Bob-Lo Excursion Company.\"\n\nThe excursion service and Boblo Island Amusement Park were sold in the 1940s, and again in 1979. However, the  Ste. Claire continued operating between Detroit and Bob-Lo Island until 1991, a run of 81 years.  After the island park closed, she was sold to a commercial firm and fell into disrepair.  In 2003 she was towed to Toledo, Ohio for restoration. In 2015, the vessel was towed to the former Detroit Lime Dock on the Rouge River, while her restoration remained in limbo.\n\nTemporary alterations to both Columbia and Ste. Claire were made for the 2014 feature film Transformers: Age of Extinction.\n\nThe Saint Claire was engulfed in an accidental fire while docked on the Detroit River on July 6, 2018. The fire could not be contained and destroyed the historic mahogany woodwork and upper decks. \"Yeah, she's 110 years old, but she's well-built and she survived,\" said boat co-owner, Ron Kattoo. \"We are at the point in restoration to where it was a steel skeleton structure ready to be rebuilt.\" As of 2019, the vessel is docked at Riverside Marina in Detroit.\n\nDescription\nThe Ste. Claire was a propeller-driven excursion steamer with a riveted steel hull and a wooden superstructure strengthened with steel members. The hull was 190 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 17.3 feet in molded depth. She was powered by a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine with Scotch boilers. The main deck overhung the hull, and the open decks above were rounded at the bow, a characteristic of the Bob-Lo fleet.\n\nThe main staircase was in the center of the main deck, leading upward to the upper decks. A second stair underneath lead down to the crew spaces in the hull. On either side of the main stair were gangplank openings for loading passengers. Forward of the stair was a large open deck space. Aft of the stair, a passageway ran across the vessel, aft of which is the stack casing and a well that opened down into the engine room, where the main engine could be seen by passengers on the main deck. Food service counters were placed at the aft end of the main deck, surrounded by open spaces, and a pair of stairs leading to decks above. Amidships, public rest rooms and crews quarters were placed on either side of the ship.\n\nThe main staircase lead upward to the main cabin on the second deck. The cabin was finished in mahogany with a cream-painted beamed ceiling. Aft of the cabin was a dance floor. The main cabin had doors out to open spaces forward and aft. The main stair leads upward to another, smaller cabin on the third deck. Doors here lead to the open deck and to a \"beer garden\" located above the dance floor. A final stair on the open deck lead to the top deck. Public access to the top deck was limited; the area also included the pilot house and lifeboat storage.\n\nSee also\n \n List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Southwestern Ontario Digital Archive: S.S.

Ste. Claire SS. Ste. Claire was a Canadian cargo ship that sank on Lake Superior in November, 1958. The ship had left Port Arthur, Ontario, on November 5, with a cargo of 15,260 tons of iron ore, bound for Toledo, Ohio. The ship was last heard from on November 9, and was reported missing two days later. The ship had been built in 1922 by the Canadian Pacific Railway's shipbuilding division as one of a pair of sister ships, the other being SS. Ste. Marie. In the early morning hours of November 22, 1958, the Ste. Claire was driven onto a reef by a storm. The ship broke up and sank in about 90 metres (300 ft) of water. The ship's crew of 29 managed to abandon ship in lifeboats, and were picked up by the Canadian Coast Guard ship CSS Griffon the next day. The ship had sunk in Canadian waters about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of the U.S. territorial border. The Canadian Hydrographic Service has since corrected the charts of the area to show the actual location of the reef, and the lake has been dredged in the area to remove the remains of the ship. The official cause of the disaster was never determined, but the ship's captain, J.E. McWilliam, had ordered a course change that took the ship directly over the reef. In the years since the sinking, several attempts have been made to find the ship, and in 2002, the wreck of the Ste.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ducati Desmosedici\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ducati Desmosedici is a four-stroke V4 engine racing motorcycle made by Ducati for MotoGP racing. The series nomenclature is GP with the two-digit year appended, such as Desmosedici GP10 for 2010. In 2006 Ducati made a short production run of 1,500 street-legal variants, the Desmosedici RR.\n\nBackground \nDucati abandoned the Grand Prix racing scene at the start of the 1970s. For many years the 500 class was essentially a class for two-stroke motorcycles, an engineering technology that was far removed from the four-stroke road-going machines sold by Ducati. Technical rules changed in 2002, giving priority to four-stroke machinery and turning the 500 class of World Road Racing into the MotoGP Championship. This convinced Ducati to make a much-awaited return to the track in the new MotoGP class.\n\nDucati history is classically based on 90\u00b0 V-twin (or L-twin) engines, using desmodromic valve technology. Initially, Ducati considered the possibility of creating a MotoGP 'super-twin', taking advantage of the MotoGP regulations that give twin-cylinder machines a considerable weight reduction over four, five or six-cylinder bikes. However, analysis indicated that a twin-cylinder engine would not have been able to produce the required amount of power, without excessively increasing the number of revs. A twin would have had to rev at over 17,000\u00a0rpm, but this would require a very short stroke and a very large bore, as a result producing possible combustion problems.\n\nThe basis of the design of the Desmosedici engine therefore is two classical Ducati L-twins next to each other, making a Double L-twin with two-cylinder Stroking at the same time (also called Twin Pulse). With four valves per cylinder, the total number of valves is sixteen \u2013 Desmosedici means desmodromic distribution with sixteen valves shortened in Italian.\n\nDesign had started in 2001, the bike was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the following seasons MotoGP World Championship. Vittoriano Guareschi, the Ducati Corse test-rider, followed every phase of the Desmosedici's development process from early testing to track debut and the project's evolution. In 2007, Ducati's pilot Casey Stoner, riding a Desmosedici, obtained Ducati's first MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nIn early 2021, Ducati rider Johann Zarco set the highest trap speed record in competition practice on the Desmosedici.\n\nGP3 \nWhile still fully committed to Superbike racing, the Ducati Marlboro Team of Loris Capirossi and Troy Bayliss would compete in all rounds of the 2003 MotoGP championship. The Desmosedici GP3 quickly scored a series of results with Loris Capirossi, who stepped onto the podium in the opening round of the championship in Japan and won the GP Catalunya in Barcelona. Riders Capirossi finished fourth in the final championship standings and Bayliss sixth; while Ducati finished second overall in the Manufacturers' standings.\n\nGP4 \nIn 2004 the Desmosedici GP4, again in the hands of Capirossi and Bayliss, underwent a series of major modifications. A large part of the season went by before the bike became competitive, but the season concluded with both riders on the podium.\n\nGP5 \n\nThe GP5 version lined up for Ducati's third season in MotoGP, with Bayliss replaced by the Spanish rider Carlos Checa. Thanks to a collaboration agreement with Bridgestone, Ducati could finally contribute to the development of new tyres and by the end of the season the Desmosedici became a competitive machine. Bridgestone found that hard tyres suited the bike more than softer tyres to create grip, allowing it to spin the rear wheel gave better control. Capirossi took two wins in the Grand Prix of Japan at Motegi and in the Malaysian GP at Sepang, while Checa scored a brace of podium finishes.\n\nGP6 \nLaunched at the Italian skiing resort of Madonna di Campiglio, the GP6 is a lighter and more powerful version of the GP5. Involving better aerodynamics and a better fuel tank position, most importantly, although more powerful, the engine delivery was smoothened to make the bike more rideable. This made the bike slower on top speed, but quicker into, around and out of corners.\n\nThe new rider with Capirossi was Spanish rider Sete Gibernau. After encouraging winter tests, the Desmosedici GP6 took its first win of 2006 in the opening GP at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, followed by a podium in Qatar. Capirossi led the championship for a short while, but at the start of the Grand prix de Catalunya at Barcelona, Gibernau's bike collided with Capirossi's after Gibernau braked too late and compressed his brake lever further after impacting it on the back of Capirossi's bike. Both riders ended up injured and in the hospital, with Gibernau sustaining a broken collar bone, and both missed the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen. Capirossi returned at the British Grand Prix, while Gibernau was replaced by German Alex Hofmann for the Dutch Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, and also the Czech Grand Prix after undergoing additional surgery. With Gibernau  sidelined for the final round of the season at Valencia following a collision with Casey Stoner, Ducati recalled Bayliss, who was recently crowned World Superbike champion. The race was won by Bayliss, his first MotoGP victory, with Capirossi taking second place for the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish.\n\nGP7 \nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to cap motors to a maximum displacement of 800\u00a0cc. In response, Ducati built the GP7. Its specifications were: 800\u00a0cc bike, double L-Twin motor (4 Cylinder Twin Pulse).\n\nDucati started its project to build an 800\u00a0cc MotoGP bike extremely early and according to Ducati's racing chief Filippo Preziosi, by August 2006 Ducati had already built twenty 800\u00a0cc engines with various specifications. In addition, an early version of the bike was track tested for the first time during early May 2006. Public testing with the bike began at the Brno Track, where Loris Capirossi had won the day before riding the GP6, on the 21st of August. Capirossi's lap times on the prototype GP7 were only 1.4 seconds off his track record time set on the 990\u00a0cc GP6.\n\nFurther testing of the GP7 in Motegi, Japan, revealed that the 800\u00a0cc machine could run faster laps than the higher-displacement 990\u00a0cc bikes, and held nearly a second advantage over the next fastest 800\u00a0cc bike, a Honda ridden by Dani Pedrosa.\n\nMotoGP's 800\u00a0cc era officially began with the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed advantage over the rest of the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, realised that \"unfortunately, there was too much difference between (our) bikes in the straight\" and \"Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati.\" These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly by the end of the year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season.\n\nGP8 \n\nAn update of the GP7 design, Ducati's entry for the 2008 MotoGP World Championship was tested first in February 2007.\n\nFor purposes of avoiding chatter which was encountered on some occasions with GP7, the rigidity of the GP8's frame was altered, although further details of relevant modifications are not disclosed. In addition, in an attempt to reduce an effect described as \"pumping\", some modifications to the bike's suspension geometry were made.\n\nAs with its predecessor the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800\u00a0cc engine with desmodromic actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power compared to that of the GP7.\n\nThroughout 2007, Ducati tested a special fuel-saving clutch arrangement which disengaged the clutch during braking and reduced fuel consumption, however the arrangement was not incorporated in the GP8 as various advanced lubricants and fuels used with the GP8 are believed to provide comparable fuel savings, while decreasing internal engine friction and increasing maximum power.\n\nIn race trim, the bike recorded an official top speed of  at the 2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nGP9 \nThe GP9 was Ducati's entry for the 2009 MotoGP World Championship. Ducati began testing it on track prior to May 2008.  On 9 June 2008, Ducati publicly rolled out the Desmosedici GP9 for testing at Circuit de Catalunya.\n\nA distinctive feature of GP9 is its carbon fibre chassis, representing a departure from Ducati's traditional steel trellis chassis. Although carbon fibre chassis were tried in mid 1980s, currently no other MotoGP racing team uses them.\n\nGP10 \nOn January 15, 2010, Ducati introduced the GP10 for the 2010 MotoGP season. Development concentrated on improving engine longevity, to keep within new engine restrictions, and rideability. Most notably, the GP10 makes use of a big-bang firing order for the first time since the Desmosedici changed from the 990\u00a0cc to the 800\u00a0cc engine capacity. Ducati also redesigned the fairing, first seen at the 2009 Estoril round.\n\nGP11 \nOn January 12, 2011, Ducati introduced the GP11 for the 2011 MotoGP season. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP12 \nOn March 19, 2012, Ducati unveiled the GP12 for the 2012 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season which incorporated new displacement standards of up to 1,000\u00a0cc in capacity. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP16 \nThe Desmosedici GP16 was unveiled in February 2016. It ran the first two pre-season tests with race riders Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone without a livery. Ducati's MotoGP boss Gigi Dall'Igna describes the 2016 Desmosedici as an \"evolution\" of its recent challengers. The GP16 was still the fastest bike in a straight line with its extra power. The winglets remained from the previous year, albeit now coloured to match the predominantly white and red Desmosedici.\n\nIn the 10th round of the season in Austria, Ducati dominated all sessions. Andrea Iannone and Andrea Dovizioso qualified 1st and 3rd respectively. In the race, Ducati used their lack of wheelies and extra power to stretch out a gap to Jorge Lorenzo after some laps. The two bikes stayed together, with Dovizioso in first for most of the race. But Iannone out-braked him and took the lead into the penultimate corner of the last lap. The win was the first for Iannone in MotoGP and his first since Moto2 Italy 2012. The win was the first for Ducati (and any other manufacturer than Honda or Yamaha) since Casey Stoner won for the team in 2010 Australian Grand Prix. Dovizioso finished in 2nd place to mark the first Ducati 1\u20132 finish since the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nIn the 17th round of the season at the newly resurfaced Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, Dovizioso took his second pole of the year in wet conditions. At the start, he fell back to 4th while Iannone, who had qualified in 6th place, led briefly before falling to 2nd place. He stayed there till he crashed at Turn 9. That left Valentino Rossi with Dovizioso at the front and Jorge Lorenzo in a distant 3rd place. Rossi ran wide at turn 1 some laps later and fell back by around 1+ seconds per lap. 'DesmoDovi' held on for his first win with Ducati and his first win since his victory at Donington Park with the Repsol Honda Team in 2009.\n\nDesmosedici RR \n\nThe Desmosedici RR is a road-legal version of the Desmosedici, first delivered in early 2008.\n\nComplete MotoGP results\n\nMotorcycle summary\nThese results are accurate up to the 2021 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nWorld Championship titles:\nRiders: 1 (Casey Stoner )\nTeams: 2 (Ducati Marlboro Team , Ducati Lenovo Team )\nConstructors: 3 (, , )\n\nRaces won: 58\n2003: Capirossi 1 (1 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 2 (2 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 3, Bayliss 1 (4 in total)\n2007: Stoner 10, Capirossi 1 (11 in total)\n2008: Stoner 6 (6 in total)\n2009: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2010: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2016: Iannone 1, Dovizioso 1 (2 in total)\n2017: Dovizioso 6 (6 in total)\n2018: Dovizioso 4, Lorenzo 3 (7 in total)\n2019: Dovizioso 2, Petrucci 1 (3 in total)\n2020: Dovizioso 1, Petrucci 1 (2 in total)\n2021: Miller 2, Mart\u00edn 1, Bagnaia 4 (7 in total)\n\nPoles: 55\n2003: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 2, Gibernau 1 (3 in total)\n2007: Stoner 5 (5 in total)\n2008: Stoner 9 (9 in total)\n2009: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2010: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2014: Dovizioso 1 (1 in total)\n2015: Dovizioso 1, Iannone 1 (2 in total)\n2016: Dovizioso 2, Iannone 1 (3 in total)\n2018: Lorenzo 4, Dovizioso 2, Miller 1 (7 in total)\n2020: Zarco 1 (1 in total)\n2021: Bagnaia 6, Mart\u00edn 4, Zarco 1 (11 in total)\n\nDucati Desmosedici results\n(key) (results in bold indicate pole position; results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nNotes\n\n1 Being his final MotoGP race, Capirossi switched numbers for Valencia as a memorial to his fallen countryman Marco Simoncelli, killed at Sepang, by racing with No. 58 that Simoncelli used, instead of his normal No. 65.

Development of the Desmosedici began in 2004, in a project codenamed \"Project 11\". The project's goal was to produce a V4 engine that was lighter, more compact, and more powerful than the existing V-twin engine used in the Ducati 999. In 2007, the Desmosedici was introduced on the race track, and in 2008 it was introduced on the street, in the Ducati Desmosedici RR. The Desmosedici (pronounced \"de-mos-de-dee-chee\" in English, Italian for \"desmodromic valve\") engine has a 90\u00b0 V-angle, with four cylinders, each with 4 valves, and with a total capacity of 1,198 cc. It is liquid-cooled, and has a very oversquare bore/stroke ratio (the bore is 80 mm (3.15 in) and the stroke is only 41.5 mm (1.6 in)), which gives the engine very high revving abilities. The engine is fed by a large airbox, and by a 55 mm (2.2 in) throttle body. The Desmosedici's construction is unique. It has a monocoque construction, with the engine block, cylinder head, and swingarm all cast in a single piece. The engine also uses a \"stacked\" design, with the front bank of cylinders angled backward, and the rear bank angled forward. This allows the engine to be more compact, and also allows the engine to be placed in a \"reverse\" configuration, with the rear cylinder bank pointing toward the front of the motorcycle. The Desmosedici was designed to be a \"race engine\", and was not designed with street use in mind. As a result, it was not equipped with many of the features that are standard on street motorcycles, such as a rev limiter, a throttle-by-wire system, traction control, or anti-lock braking. The Desmosedici also has a very high compression ratio, which further limits its usability on the street. Despite these limitations, the Desmosedici was homologated for street use in the United States, Europe, and Japan. However, due to its very high price, and its very limited production numbers, the Desmosedici was never a big seller. Only 1,200 Desmosedicis were produced, and the last one was produced in 2015.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2456422}

Roth is a state-recognized health resort (Erholungsort) and is hence also called Roth-Siedel. The municipality lies in the western Hunsr\u00fcck, near the border with the Saarland. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf. ## History Roth lies in a dale between the low Erbeskopf (a mountain) and the high Hunsr\u00fcck. This area was already settled in prehistoric times. In 1985, a stone ax was found in Roth, and in the nearby village of Niedersayn a stone hatchet. Both finds are from the Neolithic period. Roth's municipal area is rich in prehistoric and early historic finds. Some of them have been gathered together and are on display at the municipal museum. Roth's oldest parts are the so-called R\u00f6merberg (German for \"Roman mountain\") and the old village (alte Dorf). The R\u00f6merberg is a hill whose eastern slopes, toward the Dierbach valley, have been terraced. On the higher of these two terraces, some of the stone remnants of a Roman country estate (villa rustica) have been preserved. It is believed that the villa had two building phases, the first in the 1st century and the second in the 3rd century. In the lower, western part of the municipal area, towards the Binger Scharlachberg (a hill), have been found several graves from the New Stone Age, the Iron Age, and the Roman period. One of these graves, from the 1st century, yielded the first evidence of a Celtic settlement in the area. Roth had its first documentary mention in 1263. At that time, it was called Rutha. The local saying \"as old as Roth\" (German: alt wie Roth) refers to this. In the 14th century, Roth was pledged to the County of Sponheim. Later it was ruled by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz. After the Veldenz line died out, Roth, in 1556, passed to the Margraviate of Baden. The Margraves of Baden introduced the Reformation into their territories early on. The subjects of the R\u00f6merberg farmstead, however, remained Catholic. In the 17th century, the R\u00f6merberg was the seat of a noble family, the \"R\u00f6mer\" (German for \"Roman\"). The last of this line, Anna Regina, died in 1757. She had outlived her two sons, and so the R\u00f6mer part of the farmstead was inherited by the Protestant branch of the von Gymnich family. After the Thirty Years' War, the R\u00f6merberg, which had belonged to the Catholic branch of the family, was sold to the Protestant branch. Since 1707, Roth has been in the Kingdom of Prussia, later the German Empire, and since 1949 in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1757, the R\u00f6merberg was acquired by the counts of Metternich. It remained in their ownership until the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) took over the so-called \"R\u00f6merturm\" (\"Roman tower\"), which was part of the R\u00f6merberg, in 1979. After German reunification, the tower was returned to the municipality of Roth, and it is now in private ownership. In the 19th century, the R\u00f6merberg was the home of the so-called R\u00f6merkind (German for \"Roman child\"), a girl who was allegedly raised by the \"R\u00f6mer\" (the last owner of the R\u00f6merberg, who had no children of his own). In 1974, Roth became the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf, which was newly formed by the merger of the former municipalities of Thalfang, Kaperich, and Roth. ## Politics ### Municipal council The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. ### Mayor Roth's mayor is Klaus Schoneweg (FDP). ### Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Azure a Wheel of Fortune argent. ## Culture and sightseeing ### Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate's Directory of Cultural Monuments: * Saint Nicholas's Catholic Church (Kirche St. Nikolai),", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 465208}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lucy and Ricky Ricardo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, also known simply as Lucy and Ricky or the Ricardos, are fictional characters from the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, portrayed respectively by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The Ricardos also appear in The Lucy\u2013Desi Comedy Hour, and Lucy also appears in one episode of The Ann Sothern Show.\n\nTogether, Lucy and Ricky serve as a double act. Ricky is the straight man, a character very similar to Arnaz himself; he is a Cuban-American bandleader whose trademark song is \"Babalu\". Red-haired Lucy is his wife, who always gets into trouble and is usually caught at it by Ricky. Their son, Ricky Ricardo Jr. (usually called \"Little Ricky\"), was born in the middle of the show's second season. He was portrayed by child actor Richard Keith beginning in season 6.\n\nLucy's full name (Lucille Esmeralda Ricardo  McGillicuddy) is given in the Season 1 episodes \"Fred and Ethel Fight\" and \"The Marriage License,\" and \"The Passports\" in Season 5. Ricky gives his full name in the Season 4 episode \"Hollywood Anniversary\" as Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha, but in the Season 6 episode \"Lucy Raises Tulips\" Lucy calls him \"Enrique Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha III\".\n\nFictional character biographies\n\nEarly lives \nMuch like Lucille Ball herself, Lucy McGillicuddy was born and raised in Jamestown, New York (or West Jamestown as revealed in Season 5), to an American family of Scottish descent. In one episode in which she is asked her birthday, she gives it as August 6 (the same as Ball's), though in typical fashion, she refuses to give the year; in another, where she is forced to tell the truth, she says she is 33 years old. This episode aired during the third season in 1953. This makes her born in the year 1920. \n\nIn the episode, her parents are never referred to by name, and only her mother (portrayed by Kathryn Card) is seen over the course of the series. No other family is even mentioned, except for a passing reference to her grandmother being Swedish (Jamestown has a large Swedish community). In the season 5 episode \"The Passports\", it is established she was born in 1921, therefore is exactly 10 years younger than Ball in real life.\n\nIn grammar school, she played a petunia in a recital. In high school, she was involved in the drama program, wherein she studied with Miss Hanna and played Juliet Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. She also played the saxophone in high school (as did the real Lucy), though every song she played sounded like \"The Glow-Worm\". Lucy also knows how to play the ukulele. She is seen playing a ukulele in episodes \"Ricky Loses His Voice\", \"Don Juan is Shelved\", and \"Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright\".\n\nA reference to Lucille's attendance at an unnamed junior college is made in the episode \"Fan Magazine Interview\" (1954); Jamestown Community College, the nearest junior college to Lucy's hometown, did not exist until 1950, although a business college and nursing school did exist in the city at the time.\n\nMarriage \nWhen she was 22, Lucy was set up on a blind date by her friend Marion Strong. Her blind date turned out to be a Cuban conga drummer, Ricky Ricardo. The two fell in love and eventually got married at the Byram River Beagle Club in Connecticut. An alternate scenario given to guest star Hedda Hopper in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour episode \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" with Lucy and friend Susie McNamara (Ann Sothern, reprising her role from Private Secretary), is that Lucy met Ricky while vacationing in Cuba in 1940.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Lucy and Ricky moved into an old reconverted brownstone apartment at 623 East 68th Street in New York City (references made during the series date the move to 1940 or 1943). In reality, this address does not exist (the last numbered building on E 68th Street is 590, so this address would be in the East River). The apartment rented for $105 per month. Their landlords (soon to be best friends) were Fred and Ethel Mertz. Lucy and Ethel quickly became best friends, even though Ethel is older than Lucy. Upon moving to the city, Ricky ends up getting a job headlining the Tropicana where he and his band are held over indefinitely.\n\nTo Lucy, Ricky's career and days seem so much more exciting than her days of cooking and cleaning. She desperately wants to be a star and constantly tries to get into Ricky's act. Ricky wants his wife to remain a homemaker. However, in spite of Ricky's reluctance and regular refusal to give her a role, Lucy sometimes finds a way into the show.\n\nBirth of Little Ricky \nIn 1952, after going to the doctor complaining of feeling \"dauncey\" (a word her grandmother made up; Lucy's definition of feeling \"dauncey\" is when you are not really sick but just feel lousy) and gaining weight, she learns that she is pregnant. It is actually Ethel who first suggests to Lucy she may be expecting, even before Lucy heads out to the doctor. Lucy is very excited to tell her husband the news.\n\nThe Mertzes learn the news first and are sworn to secrecy. When she was younger, Lucy had envisioned how she would tell her husband they were going to have a baby. She decides to tell Ricky when he comes home for lunch that afternoon. However, with repeated interruptions from the telephone and the Mertzes, she is unable. She tries to tell him down at his club during rehearsals, but is uncomfortable telling him such a personal thing in front of his band, so she runs out crying.\n\nFinally, that evening, while Ricky is performing, Lucy pens a note and passes it to the ma\u00eetre d'hotel. He gives the note to Ricky. Ricky reads the note, which alludes to a wife needing to tell her husband they are having a baby, and requests that he sing a particular song. Ricky, unaware that the \"husband\" mentioned in the note is himself, wants to bring the expectant couple up on stage to congratulate them. He goes from couple to couple trying to find them. Ricky notices Lucy in the audience, and it occurs to him that Lucy may be the one who is expecting. Lucy nods yes, and Ricky is overcome with emotion. They sing \"We're Having a Baby\", with Lucille Ball actually breaking down in tears during the scene.\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Lucy experiences the normal pregnancy woes. She becomes depressed when everyone seems to focus their attention on the impending child and not on Lucy. She cannot decide on a name for the child and is nervous that she will not be a good mother. However, she wants the best for her child and enrolls herself, Ricky, and the Mertzes in elocution lessons to make sure her child learns how to speak properly. Finally, she takes up sculpting so she and Ricky can enrich their child's life with art and music. However, Lucy's show business aspirations never wane. She manages to break into Ricky's barbershop quartet number by firing the man who has the part she wants.\n\nFinally, on January 19, 1953 \u2014 the same day she had her real-life son Desi Arnaz Jr. (technically IV) \u2014 while husband Ricky is performing a voodoo act at his nightclub, Lucy gives birth to Ricky Ricardo Jr. The Mertzes are named Little Ricky's godparents. Little Ricky grows on a season-by-season basis, and by the sixth season (1957), he has started school and learned to play the drums and speak Spanish.\n\nHollywood \nIn 1954, Ricky is given a role in an upcoming MGM film based on the life of Don Juan. Lucy and the Mertzes follow Ricky on his journey to Hollywood stardom. While in Hollywood, Lucy meets many famous celebrities, including William Holden, Hedda Hopper, Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde, Harpo Marx, Richard Widmark, Van Johnson and John Wayne. Some of these actors are celebrities that Ricky has already met as a result of his work.\n\nShe reports having spotted 99 celebrities while in Hollywood and finally procures an even 100 when she meets Wilde. Lucy is incredibly starstruck and saves anything that had come in contact with a celebrity, such as a can smashed by Cary Grant's left rear wheel. However, she does not just hobnob with celebrities; she also gets a few chances to break into show business herself.\n\nRicky gets her a small role in a film as a showgirl. Lucy's role requires her to wear a large headdress; she also gets a death scene. However, the headdress proves cumbersome, and her part is downgraded. She eventually ends up as a showgirl who is already dead on a stretcher when the scene begins. Lucy's second foray into show business is when she replaces Van Johnson's sick redheaded partner in his act at the hotel. She wants to impress her friend Carolyn Appleby and successfully coaxes Johnson give her the job through flattery.\n\nFinally, she has her third shot at stardom when she appears with a Ricky Ricardo dummy at a luncheon for movie executives. Ricky was asked to perform, but he declined in favor of a fishing trip he had planned. Lucy accepted on his behalf and schemed to build a dummy of Ricky and then pretend that he is ill, and she finishes the show herself. Her plan does not go as well as she had hoped, but she is still a success, as the executives think the performance is meant to be a comedy act, and she is offered a contract. However, she declines when she realizes that it would take her away from her husband, son and friends.\n\nEurope \nVery soon after returning home from Hollywood, Ricky's band is given a chance to tour around Europe. Fred is recruited as Ricky's band manager and Lucy and Ethel tag along. Lucy misses the boat and has to be lowered to the deck of the cruise ship, the USS Constitution, from a helicopter. They sail across the Atlantic, where Lucy has to settle for being partnered with a young boy to play games on deck but together they win a ping pong trophy. She also manages to get stuck in a porthole.\n\nAfter landing in England, Lucy gets the chance to perform for and meet Queen Elizabeth. She also participates in a fox hunt and gets to stay at an English estate.\n\nIn Paris, she meets Charles Boyer who has been warned by Ricky not to admit who he is because Lucy is so star-struck; Boyer takes his advice when Lucy corners him and claims he is Maurice DuBois, an out-of-work actor. Ricky has feigned jealousy about Lucy's obsession with Charles Boyer so she hires \"DuBois\" to impersonate Boyer and pitch woo to her in front of Ricky so she can reassure him with her total lack of interest. She coaches \"DuBois\" on Boyer's \"growl\" and mannerisms, remaining unaware that he is the real Boyer until Ethel calls her and reveals Ricky and Boyer's trick.\n\nIn another episode, Lucy is arrested by French police after inadvertently using counterfeit money. The scene that ensues, after Ricky arrives to bail her out, involves the only-French-speaking Commandante interrogating Lucy by directing questions to his French-and-German-speaking Lieutenant in French, who translates the questions into German and directs them to a drunken German-and-Spanish-speaking prisoner, who translates the questions into Spanish to ask Spanish-and-English-speaking Ricky, who makes the final translation into English for Lucy. Her answers must travel back up the chain to the Commandante.\n\nAlso, she stomps on grapes in Turo, a winemaking town in Italy, and wrestles her professional grape-stomping partner in a grape vat.\n\nMoving to Connecticut \nIn 1956, Lucy and Ricky decide to move to Connecticut after making a trip there, and Lucy falls in love with the area. Before they move in, though, she tries unsuccessfully to get out of the deal. Soon the Ricardos decide to raise chickens and sell the eggs. To help them with their business, their best friends, Fred Mertz and Ethel Mertz, move into their guest house, as Fred was raised on a farm. Lucy and Ricky also make close friends while in Connecticut, Betty and Ralph Ramsey (the Ricardos' next door neighbors).\n\nAfter I Love Lucy\nI Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour concluded in the aftermath of Arnaz and Ball's real-life divorce in 1960, an incident that was not written into the script. The characters remained married to each other at the end of the series' run.\n\nLucille Ball would go on to perform Lucy Ricardo-inspired characters on her ensuing sitcoms: The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and the short-lived Life with Lucy. In each series, the character Ball portrayed (each one named Lucy) was a widow or divorce\u00e9. In the mid-1960s, she was involved in a lawsuit against Jess Oppenheimer, the co-creator of I Love Lucy, over the similarities among the separate Lucy characters. The dispute was later settled out of court.\n\nArnaz only portrayed a similar Ricky Ricardo character once after The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour ended its run: in a recurring role on The Mothers-in-Law, Arnaz portrayed matador Raphael Delgado, with the same accent and personality as Ricky (as a Desilu production, The Mothers-in-Law used many of the same writers and executive staff as the Lucy shows).\n\nOther television series, especially those created by Desilu (the production company Arnaz and Ball co-founded) sought to copy the Lucy Ricardo theme. Even Janis Paige, in her short-lived Desilu produced CBS sitcom It's Always Jan, wore her hair like Lucy's, and Cara Williams followed the Lucy Ricardo format in Pete and Gladys, which lasted only two seasons on CBS.\n\nReferences \n\nI Love Lucy characters\nFictional characters from New York (state)\nTelevision characters introduced in 1951\nFictional families\nFictional married couples\nTelevision duos\nIntercultural and interracial relationships", "machine_text": " Lucy and Ricky Ricardo Lucy and Ricky Ricardo (known by their married name Lucy and Ricky Jones in the later seasons of the series) are fictional characters from the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, which was created and produced by Desilu Productions and CBS. The characters were portrayed by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, respectively, and appeared in the series' entire run, from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957. The Ricardos are a married couple who live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, with Lucy working as a magician's assistant and Ricky as a bandleader. While Lucy dreams of becoming a performer, Ricky is concerned with his career and wants to avoid the trappings of show business. Their marriage is tested by the couple's mutual interest in show business, as well as their mutual distaste for living in the city. In the first season, the couple has a neighbor, Mrs. Trumbull, who often babysits for the couple's child, Little Ricky (known as Richard, Jr. in later seasons). In the second and third seasons, the couple has a best friend, Mary Caroline \"Carrie\" Snodgress, who often visits and looks after the couple's interests in the country. In the fourth season, the couple moves to the country and purchases a farm, with Snodgress living nearby. In 2002, the American Film Institute ranked the couple at No. 5 on their list of the greatest movie couples of all time. In 2008, the couple was ranked the second-greatest TV couple of all time by the same institute. In 2013, TV Guide ranked the couple at No. 1 in its list of the 60 Best Couples of All Time. The relationship between Lucy and Ricky Ricardo has been compared to the relationship between Ball and Arnaz off-screen, and the two were often described as \"carbon copies\" of each other. The couple's relationship was also influenced by the real-life relationship between Ball and Arnaz, who were married to each other at the time the series was produced. I Love Lucy was Arnaz's brainchild, and he intended for the series to be a vehicle for his real-life wife, Ball. The couple's relationship was further complicated by the fact that, during the series' run, Ball and Arnaz were having an affair with each other.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11167343}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Oath of Pontida\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The oath of Pontida (Giurament de Pontida in Lombard, Giuramento di Pontida in Italian), according to tradition, would have been a ceremony that would have sanctioned on 7 April 1167, in the abbey of Pontida, near Bergamo, in Italy, the birth of the Lombard League, or of a military alliance between the municipalities of Milan, Lodi, Ferrara, Piacenza and Parma aimed at the armed struggle against the Holy Roman Empire by Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nThe oath of Pontida does not appear on contemporary documents, being mentioned for the first time in 1505, then three and a half centuries after the traditional date of 7 April 1167.\n\nHistory\n\nContemporary sources\n\nThe event is questioned by historians, given that in the contemporary chronicles written between 1152 and 1189, no Pontida oath is cited. Its first mention is in fact late, since it appears on a document dated 1505.\n\nHowever, contemporary sources cite the fact that the municipalities of the Lombard League had signed pacts to counter Barbarossa's hegemony by helping each other. Most of these writings, however, argue the event in a rather vague way, without describing the details: neither the locations nor the precise dates of the signing of the pacts are mentioned. On the Piacentina chronicle, regarding the agreement reached for the rebuilding of Milan, we can read:\n\nThe most precise contemporary historical sources tell of at least three oaths among the municipalities of the Lombard League: the first, signed between the end of February and the beginning of March 1167 between Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Mantua and known as the \"Bergamo oath \"; the second, also signed by Milan in March 1167, which joined the four cities in the just mentioned oath; the third, also signed by Lodi in May of the same year, which became part of the previously mentioned coalition, formed by Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Mantua and Milan.\n\nConsidering the date of 7 April 1167, we can therefore state that the oath of Pontida, even if it was actually signed, was not the constitution of the Lombard League, since at least two previous oaths are cited on historical documents.\n\nThe following documents\n\nIn addition to the chronological aspect, which would seem to demonstrate the non-existence of the oath of Pontida as a constitutive pact of the Lombard League due to the two agreements signed before 7 April 1167, the first mention of the incident must certainly also be considered which is quite posterior.\n\nIn particular, the oath of Pontida appears for the first time on a document dated 1505 by Bernardino Corio - therefore about 350 years after the canonical date of 7 April 1167 - which is called Historia Patria and which has as its subject the history of Milan.\n\nThen all the subsequent documents referring to the oath of Pontida were inspired by the Historia Patria by Bernardino Corio. In an excerpt from the code of 1584 Successores S. Barnabae Apostoli in Ecclesia Mediolanensi, which refers to a note on the archbishop of Milan Umberto Pirovano, it is reported that:\n\nIn Archiepiscoporum Mediolanensium series historico-chronologica, which was compiled by Giuseppe Antonio Sassi in 1755 and which is linked to the aforementioned text of 1584, it can instead be read:\n\nHypothesis on a possible oath of Pontida\nHowever, it is possible that there were other agreements signed by the municipalities of the Lombard League of which the documented trace was then lost. In fact, over the centuries, there are many examples in which several meetings were needed to write down all the aspects of a bargaining: in other words, in history, it has been difficult to define in detail a pact or an alliance in few sessions.\n\nAs far as Pontida is concerned, we must also observe its close link with Milan: the municipality near Bergamo belonged to the archdiocese of Milan although it was understood, from a geographical point of view, in the county of Bergamo.\n\nIt is therefore not excluded that there was also an oath at Pontida, whose references to contemporary documentation were then lost.\n\nCommemorations\nEvery year at Pontida, in the month of June, in the Giuramento square, the historical phases that led to the birth of the military pact signed, according to tradition, on 7 April 1167 are recalled by about one hundred people in costume. On the occasion of the re-enactment, recreational and cultural events are also organized.\n\nSince 1990, the autonomous political party of the Lega Nord has annually organized a meeting at Pontida that celebrates the eponymous medieval oath. During the event the most important political exponents of the party intervene.\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1167 in Europe\n12th century in Italy\n1160s in the Holy Roman Empire\nHistory of Lombardy\nOaths", "machine_text": " The Oath of Pontida was an oath that the Frankish prince Charles Martel, the future Duke of Bavaria, made in 732 at a meeting in Pontida (modern day Italy).

The oath was a promise that he would be loyal to the Frankish king, and it was also an attempt to get the other noblemen to recognize his authority. The oath was witnessed by the other noblemen, and it was also witnessed by the Pope.

He subsequently served as Governor of Bermuda from 1949 to 1955.\n\nEarly life \nHood was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and educated at George Watson's College. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1910 and achieving his MD in 1931 for his research on dysentery. In 1918, Hood married Evelyn Dulcia Ellwood, with whom he had one son and two daughters.\n\nMilitary career \nAfter spending one year as the house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Hood joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He served in France and Belgium during the First World War, and then in India and Afghanistan shortly afterwards. He became a specialist in pathology, serving in Meerut and Bangalore and then as deputy assistant district pathologist for Madras region. Hood conducted research on cerebrospinal meningitis and pneumonic plague, and in 1929 he was appointed assistant district pathologist to Southern Command.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Hood was given the rank of colonel and made deputy director of medical services, Palestine. In 1941, he was promoted over several more senior figures to become Lieutenant-General Director General Army Medical Services. As DGAMS, Hood was credited with supporting developments in Army Psychiatry, helping to provide forward surgery and reorganise field medical units, and organising a blood transfusion service. By August, he was also honorary physician to George VI. He served for far longer as DGAMS than was usual. He also decreed that medical research conducted on soldiers should be solely for the purpose of preventing and curing disease and allaying injury. Hood had hoped to become the first head of a combined medical service for Navy, Army and Air Force, but this did not happen.\n\nCivil career \nHood worked for one year in the Ministry of Health. After this, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief Bermuda. As Governor, Hood oversaw the closure of the Bermuda Garrison in 1953 and also acted as host to Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Bermuda Conferences. The closure of the garrison was completed by 1 May 1953, but was very short-lived. However, a detachment of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was temporarily posted to Bermuda immediately after for the period of the conference, planned for June, 1953. The conference was actually delayed until December, when the Prime Minister was convinced to reverse the closure of the garrison, resulting in 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (1 DCLI) being posted to Prospect Camp in 1954. Hood's tenure in the role was extended twice.\n\nHood resigned effective 26 April 1955, with no explanation given. A few months later, he was granted a divorce from Lady Evelyn Dulcia Hood and married Mrs Helen Winifred Wilkinson of Hamilton, Bermuda on the same day.\n\nOther achievements \nHood enjoyed golf and was the RAMC champion. He won the Queen Victoria Jubilee Vase at St Andrews in 1953.\n\nWhen Hood died in Bermuda on 11 September 1980, his service with the RAMC was commemorated by the naming in his honour of a lecture theatre in the training depot.\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery holds a number of photographic images of Hood, mostly by Walter Stoneman.\n\nLinks \n*Portrait of Sir Alexander Hood at the National Portrait Gallery\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\nGenerals of World War II\n\n1888 births\n1980 deaths\nGolfers from Edinburgh\nPeople educated at George Watson's College\nRoyal Army Medical Corps officers\nGovernors of Bermuda\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire\nFellows of the Royal College of Physicians\nFellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\nAlumni of the University of Edinburgh\nBritish Army personnel of World War I\nBritish Army generals of World War II\nBritish civil servants\nBritish Army generals\nCommanders of the Legion of Merit\nKnights of the Order of Orange-Nassau\nKnights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order\nScottish male golfers\nScottish pathologists\n20th-century surgeons\nMilitary personnel from Edinburgh", "machine_text": " Alexander Hood (1888\u20131961) was a British Army officer who served in both the First and Second World Wars.

By 14 June 1906 the team had broadened its scope to become the sports club SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen  and in 1908 merged with local side Ballsport-Club Mars Nordhausen which had been formed in 1906. Until 1918 the club played as SV Wacker-Mars Nordhausen when it was renamed 1. SV Wacker 05 Nordhausen. Playing in the VMBV (Verband Mitteldeutscher Ballspiel Vereine or Federation of Middle German Ball Playing Teams), Wacker participated in the early rounds of the league championships in the mid- to late 20s, but without any success.\n\nAfter the end of World War II occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. The former membership of Wacker reorganized as SG Nordhausen in 1946 and this team went on to become the football department of the sports club BSG Motor Nordhausen in 1949. The club played briefly as KWU/Lok Nordhausen after a merger with an industrial club. From 1951 on the team played as BSG Motor Nordhausen-West in second tier East German football. Motor enjoyed some modest success in the early 80s but then slipped and was relegated to the third division Bezirkliga Erfurt in 1989.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990 the football department separated from the sports club to form FSV Wacker 90. The newly independent team took up play in the NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd (III) in the 1991\u201392 season and played at that level for seven years, interrupted by three seasons in the Regionalliga Nordost (III) from 1995 to 1998. During the 1990s the club made three appearances in the DFB-Pokal, in 1992\u201393, 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398 but was knocked out in the first round at each occasion.

The two clubs had a traditional rivalry and both won the Thuringia championship several times. In addition, BSG Stahl Nordhausen won the German amateur championship in 1964 and BSG Wismut Nordhausen won the East German amateur championship in 1971. BSG Wismut Nordhausen had its greatest success in the early 1970s when it won the East German Cup in 1970\u201371 and the East German championship in 1973\u201374. The club also finished runners-up in the East German championship in 1972\u201373. BSG Stahl Nordhausen had its greatest success in the early 1980s when it won the East German Cup in 1980\u201381.

The club made an immediate return to the Oberliga in 1992\u201393, when it finished in third place in its division. In the 1993\u201394 season, the club won its division and thereby gained promotion to the third-tier Regionalliga Nordost/S\u00fcd.

It was one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in The Netherlands.  Today, only part of the outbuildings remain and are known locally as De Nederhof.\n\nHistory\nThe village of Honselersdijk already had a small castle  in the Middle Ages. In the 16th century it belonged to the princes of Arenberg, but they were on the Spanish side on the Eighty Years' War, and it was expropriated by the Province of Holland and put it at disposal of prince Maurice of Orange. His younger brother, prince Frederick Henry bought the castle in 1612 to use it as hunting lodge and summer mansion. It became his primary country house and showplace of his power. The medieval castle was torn down and was replaced between 1621 and 1647 by a new moated house and gardens inspired by the French architecture of the palais de Luxembourg, but with distinct Dutch features.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Prince William II completed the building of the house, although only a few of the planned extensions, such as galleries and pavilions, were created.\nUnder  William III and Mary the gardens were renovated and the house was adapted to the needs of its time (e.g. introduction of the sash window). The house was a rallying point for the various crossings to England or entrances to the city of The Hague.\n\nAfter the death of king-stadtholder William III the house was claimed by his cousin, king Frederick I in Prussia, just as various other country houses and palaces. The Prussian king and his family mostly lived in Berlin and because of an ongoing dispute about the inheritance with the King-Stadtholders sole heirs in the Frisian Nassau branch, little or no maintenance was taken up and the house fell into disrepair. Due to negotiations between Frederick II the Great and Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the house was sold to her son prince William V in 1754. There were plans for renovation, but considered too expensive. William V occasionally used the house only for hunting purposes. The last real residents were his sister princess Carolina and her husband Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg between 1760 and 1765.\n\nDuring the French occupation the House was confiscated in 1795 and fell into decay. It was used as prison and hospital. After the restoration in the Netherlands in 1813, king William I was not inspired to save the house and it was demolished in 1815.\n\nCurrently, only part of the outbuildings remains, the \u2018Nederhof\u2019 (the lower courtyard), which was used as stables and guest quarters. Since its restoration in 1976, it is used as a foster home.\n\nArt and architecture\nPrince Frederick Henry and his wife princess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels introduced the classical architecture in the Netherlands by building various large country houses and gardens, such as Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg and Huis ten Bosch. These house were inspired on French and Italian architecture, such as the Palais du Luxembourg in Paris and the Versailles palace of king Louis XIII.\n\nWith help of their secretary, Constantijn Huygens, Frederick Henry and Amalia selected architects Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post as their architects for the house. But they were also supported by several French artists such as the architect Simon de la Vall\u00e9e and the gardener Andr\u00e9 Mollet. For the interior various artists were involved such as Gerard van Honthorst, Wybrand de Geest, Pieter de Grebber, Paulus Bor, Christiaen van Couwenbergh, Cornelis Vroom, Artus Quellinus the Elder.\n\nThe House served as inspiration for the  City Palace of Potsdam built by the son in law of prince Frederick Henry, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg.\n\nHouses completed in the 17th century\nGardens in the Netherlands\nPalaces in the Netherlands\nBuildings and structures in South Holland\nDemolished buildings and structures in the Netherlands\nBaroque architecture in the Netherlands\nLandscape design history\nBuildings and structures demolished in 1815", "machine_text": " Huis Honselaarsdijk Huis Honselaarsdijk is a 16th-century farmhouse on the Honselaarsdijkseweg in the village of Honselersdijk in the municipality of Alphen aan den Rijn, province of South Holland, Netherlands. The farmhouse was built in 1597 on the Honselaarsdijkseweg, a dike that was raised in that same year to replace the so-called \"Binnenwaterdijk\" which had been built in 1570. The Binnenwaterdijk was an artificial dike along the \"Binnenwater\" (the present-day Waal), which had been created by the inhabitants of the \"Binnenland\" (the present-day Betuwe) to protect their land from flooding by the Meuse and the Waal. The Honselaarsdijkseweg formed the western boundary of the Binnenland. The farmhouse has a frontage of 30 metres (98 ft) and a depth of 15 metres (49 ft). The building is divided into three sections. The left section contains the oldest part of the farmhouse, dating from the early 17th century. The middle section dates from the late 17th century and the right section from the early 18th century. The fa\u00e7ade of the house has many characteristics of the so-called \"W pallasidam\" style, a style that was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Betuwe area. This style is named after the first known example, a farmhouse in Aschanspergerstraat in the city of Tiel. The W pallasidam style is characterized by the use of red brick, stone, and slate, and by dormer windows, lean-to roofs, and crow-stepped gables. In 1629, the farmhouse was extended to the left with a rectangular tower. The tower has a superstructure that is half as high as the length of the farm (15 metres (49 ft)). The function of the tower was to provide a better overview of the Binnenwater. In 1632, a side-wing was added to the west side of the farmhouse. In 1639, an chapel was built on the first floor of the tower. In 1655, the chapel was extended to the west with a choir and a sacristy. In 1675, the farmhouse was extended to the right with a semi-circle extension. In the 19th century, the chapel was restored and a gallery was added. In 1964, the choir was restored. In 1998, the interior of the chapel was restored.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18754763}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Amber Room\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Amber Room (, , ) was a chamber decorated in amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors, located in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg.\n\nConstructed in the 18th century in Prussia, the room was dismantled and eventually disappeared during World War II. Before its loss, it was considered an \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". A reconstruction was made, starting in 1979 and completed and installed in the Catherine Palace in 2003.\n\nThe Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the Charlottenburg Palace, in Berlin, Prussia, but was eventually installed at the Berlin City Palace. It was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schl\u00fcter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schl\u00fcter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig (Gda\u0144sk).\n\nIt remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his ally Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia, the room was installed in the Catherine Palace. After expansion and several renovations, it covered more than  and contained over  of amber.\n\nThe Amber Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, and taken to K\u00f6nigsberg for reconstruction and display. Some time in early 1944, with Allied forces closing in on Germany, the room was disassembled and crated for storage in the Castle basement.  Konigsberg was destroyed by allied bombers in August 1944 and documentation of the room location ends there.  Its eventual fate and current whereabouts, if it survives, remain a mystery. In 1979 the decision was taken to create a reconstructed Amber Room at the Catherine Palace in Pushkin. After decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, it was completed and inaugurated in 2003.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Amber Room is a priceless piece of art, with extraordinary architectural features such as gilding, carvings, 450\u00a0kg (990\u00a0lb) amber panels, gold leaf, gemstones, and mirrors, all highlighted with candle light. Additional architectural and design features include statues of angels and children.\n\nBecause of its unique features and singular beauty, the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". Modern estimates of the room's value range from $142 million (2007) to over $500 million (2016).\n\nHistory\n\nCreation\n\nThe Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophia Charlotte. The concept and design of the room was drafted by Andreas Schl\u00fcter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig, now Gda\u0144sk in Poland.\n\nAlthough originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace, the complete panels were eventually installed at Berlin City Palace. The Amber Room did not, however, remain at Berlin City Palace for long. Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716, King Frederick I's son  Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift, which forged a Russo-Prussian alliance against Sweden.\n\nThe original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in Russia in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen. It was Peter's daughter Empress Elizabeth who decided the amber treasure should be installed at Catherine Palace, where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers. After several other 18th-century renovations, the room covered more than  and contained over  of amber. The room took over ten years to construct.\n\nEvacuation during World War II\n\nShortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room. However, over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without the amber crumbling. The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper, in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it, but the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed.\n\nGerman soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town's castle. On 13 November 1941, a K\u00f6nigsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at K\u00f6nigsberg Castle.\n\nLast days in K\u00f6nigsberg\nOrders given by Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from K\u00f6nigsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, who was in charge of civil administration in K\u00f6nigsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.\n\nIn August 1944, K\u00f6nigsberg was heavily fire-bombed by the Royal Air Force. It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945.\n\nDisappearance and mysteries \nAfter the war, the Amber Room was never seen in public again, though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm Gustloff, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.\n\nIn 1997, an Italian stone mosaic \"Feel and Touch\" that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber. The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction.\n\nIn 1998, two separate teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two locations turned out to hold the Amber Room.\n\nIn 2004, a lengthy investigation by British investigative journalists Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy concluded that the Amber Room was most likely destroyed when K\u00f6nigsberg Castle was damaged, first during the bombing of K\u00f6nigsberg by the Royal Air Force in 1944 and then by the Soviets' burning of the castle followed by shelling of the remaining walls. Official assessments, set out in documents from the Russian National Archives written by Alexander Brusov, head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war, agreed with this theory. The official report stated: \"Summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945.\"\n\nThese dates correspond with the end of the Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.\n\nAmong other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: \"It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed\".\n\nAfter the report was made public, Leonid Arinshtein, who was a lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg, said: \"I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room\". At the same time, he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments, but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose, saying: \"What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay?\"\n\nA variation of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly K\u00f6nigsberg), is that at least parts of the room were found in the K\u00f6nigsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near K\u00f6nigsberg Castle.\n\nThen in 1968, despite academic protests worldwide, Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev ordered the destruction of K\u00f6nigsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible. Later the search for the Amber Room continued in different locations, including near Wuppertal, Germany.\n\nAnother hypothesis involves a bunker in Mamerki in northeastern Poland, or that Stalin ordered the Amber Room replaced with a replica prior to its looting, hiding the original. The main problem with finding the Amber Room is that the Nazi regime hid many items in many difficult-to-reach places, usually without documentation, leaving a wide search area. The Germans also moved items to destinations far from Europe in some cases. The search for the Amber Room has also been halted by authorities. In the case of Fr\u00fddlant castle it was halted because of the historic value of the castle.\n\nIn October 2020 Polish divers from the Baltictech group found the wreck of the SS Karlsruhe, a ship which took part in Operation Hannibal, a sea evacuation which allowed more than a million German troops and civilians from East Prussia to escape advancing Soviet forces. The ship was attacked off the coast of Poland by Soviet aircraft after it sailed from K\u00f6nigsberg in 1945. The wreck holds many crates with unknown contents. An online news website, Live Science, reports that this German steamship may hold crates that contain parts of the Amber Room.\n\nReconstruction\n\nIn 1979, the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo, a process that was to take 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship. Using original drawings and old black-and-white photographs, every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room. This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room. A major problem was the lack of skilled workers, since amber carving was a nearly lost art form.\n\nThe financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of US$3.5 million from the German company E.ON. By 2003, the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.\nIn Kleinmachnow, near Berlin, there is a miniature Amber Room, fabricated after the original. The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian amber.\n\nSee also\n Art of the Third Reich\n Nazi gold train\n Siege of Leningrad\n \u0160t\u011bchovice Treasure\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nPrinted\n\nOnline\n\nExternal links\n\n Amber Room 3D panorama with high-resolution pictures of decor elements and function drag and zoom by Classic Studio\n Bibliographical Database of the International literature about the Amber Room by Peter Bruhn\n\nAmber\nArt museums and galleries in Russia\nBaroque architecture in Berlin\nBaroque architecture in Russia\nEkaterininsky park\nIndividual rooms\nLost works of art\nNazi-looted art\nTourist attractions in Saint Petersburg", "machine_text": " The Amber Room is a room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, Russia.

It was the second most popular onsen area in Tottori Prefecture during the beginning of the Sh\u014dwa era.\n\nHot spring type\nT\u014dg\u014d Onsen is classified as a chloride and sulfate type hot spring, with a spring source temperature of 85 to 94 degrees Celsius.\n\nT\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u2019s hot spring waters can be found near Matsuzaki station. Here, there is a 300-meter deep cavity in the layer of granite bedrock. This cavity is filled in with conglomerate sedimentary rock, called the Oshikagawa pyroclastic layer, along with diluvium and alluvium layers on top of it. T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u2019s water originates from the granite, Oshikagawa, and diluvium layers, and its heat source is thought to be waste heat from the granite layer.\n\nDescription\nThere is a large multipurpose health resort at the edge of T\u014dg\u014d Lake. Nearby is Japan\u2019s largest Chinese garden, Ench\u014d-en. The main hot spring resort area is to the east, where several Japanese ryokan inns operated up until and during Sh\u014dwa period. Currently, only two establishments, Y\u014dsh\u014dkan and the town-managed Suimeis\u014d, are in operation. Hot spring water flows out of the central part of the lake, causing steam to hang over its surface.\n\nThere are two ashiyu footbaths in the area, which are free for anyone to use. At T\u014dg\u014d-Hawai Seaside Park, there is a hot water fountain that can be used to create boiled eggs, known as onsen tamago. The other footbath is at Lake T\u014dg\u014d Lakeside Park, which also has a station for making onsen tamago. According to figures reported by the local government, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen reached its peak number of visitors from the early to mid-1970\u2019s, with more than 350,000 visitors per year. In contrast, most other hot spring areas within Tottori Prefecture reached their peak visitor count from the late 1980\u2019s to 1993.\n\nHistory\nThe existence of the hot spring was referenced in a document written in 1749. At the time, hot spring water was drawn out by bamboo tubes inserted into the bottom of the lake, in conjunction with bamboo gates. Other documents show that the residents of Kami-Asozu village in modern-day Yurihama received permission from the Tottori Domain to draw water from the hot spring in 1843; during the Ansei Period, the hot spring water was used to treat low back pain.\n\nThe origins of T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\n\nUse of the hot springs for bathing began in 1868, at the start of the Meiji Period; in 1872, a large bath tub was constructed on Ry\u016byu-t\u014d Island, which was located on the lake. A wealthy local farmer created a well for drawing spring water on the western bank of T\u014dg\u014d River, as well as a separate building called the Y\u014dsh\u014dkan, and gave access to the villagers. In 1884, this building began operating as a ryokan business. With the opening of the San'in Main Line and Matsuzaki station at the end of the Meiji Period, the number of yearly visitors reached 10,000 and the name T\u014dg\u014d Onsen was given to the area. Japanese novelist Naoya Shiga once visited the Y\u014dsh\u014dkan, and he mentions it in his short story collection Tottori. The Y\u014dsh\u014dkan is still operating today.\n\nThe origins of Matsuzaki Onsen\nAt the start of the Taish\u014d period, other areas near Matsuzaki station experienced an increase in onsen excavation. Around this time, many books about travel such as Japanese novelist Katai Tayama\u2019s Nihon Issh\u016b  (\u201cA trip round Japan\u201d) were being published, and public interest towards domestic travel was growing. Scientific surveys for onsen were also being conducted; this led to the discovery of a new hot spring source during the late Taish\u014d period, located near Matsuzaki station in T\u014dg\u014d River. As a result, many new inns were built. These inns became collectively known as \u201cMatsuzaki Onsen\u201d, and soon the names T\u014dg\u014d Onsen and Matsuzaki Onsen began to appear in documents.\n\nConsolidation into T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\nSoon after Matsuzaki Onsen was created, it was formed into an association with T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. According to the Nihon onsen taikan (Japan Onsen Encyclopedia) published in 1939, the total number of yearly lodging guests to the association\u2019s seven inns at the time was 62,000. This made it the second most-visited onsen district in Tottori Prefecture, following Misasa Onsen\u2019s 80,000 guests per year to its 20 inns.\nDuring the Edo Period, the narrow lakeshore on the eastern bank of the T\u014dg\u014d River was a strategically important location for military and transportation purposes, so there was a lodge there. During the Meiji Period, the area had grown to become Matsuzaki Village, and had its own local government. Similarly, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen and the surrounding areas formed T\u014dg\u014d Village. In 1951, Matsuzaki Village and T\u014dg\u014d Village merged to become T\u014dg\u014d-Matsuzaki Town; in 1953, this entity merged with surrounding villages to form T\u014dg\u014d Town. After this, the names of the hot springs were consolidated into \u201cT\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u201d.\n\nFrom the Meiji Period to the Sh\u014dwa Period, many famous people visited T\u014dg\u014d Onsen, such as politicians Shigenobu \u014ckuma, Shinpei Got\u014d, Yukio Ozaki, and Hiroshi Shimomura. Besides the aforementioned Katai Tayama and Naoya Shiga, writers such as Lafcadio Hearn, Shungetsu Ikuta, Rohan K\u014dda, and others have also visited.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Hawai- T\u014dg\u014d Hot Spring and Ryokan Association\n T\u014dg\u014d Yu-asis Ry\u016bh\u014dkaku\n\nHot springs of Japan\nPublic baths in Japan\nTourist attractions in Tottori Prefecture", "machine_text": " T\u014dg\u014d Onsen T\u014dg\u014d Onsen (\u6771\u90f7\u6e29\u6cc9) is a hot spring resort in the city of Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The resort is located in the Tsugaru region of Aomori Prefecture, on the eastern edge of the Hakk\u014dda Mountains. The hot springs are one of the more famous hot spring resorts in the region, and are one of the few that are easily accessible by a paved road. The hot springs are located along the cottony dogwood tree-lined Towada-Hachimantai National Highway. There are many onsen ryokan in the area. The sulfur springs are colored in shades of green and are said to be good for skin ailments. In the past, the springs were located along the road, but due to their popularity, most of the springs have been developed into bathhouses and ryokan. The springs are still considered to be one of the best free hot springs in the region. The springs can be found by following the road to the end, where there is a large bathhouse, the Sakuraya Bathhouse, which is free to enter. The bathhouse has a strong sulfur smell, but the water is clear. The temperature is very hot, reaching above 50 degrees Celsius. The resort is also known for its \"onsen eggs\", a local specialty in which eggs are hard-boiled in the hot spring water. The sulfur in the water turns the egg shells black, and the egg whites turn a light green. Onsen eggs are a popular local tourist souvenir, and can be found at many tourist shops in the area. T\u014dg\u014d Onsen is a popular destination for tourists, especially during the summer months. The resort is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, as it is home to a variety of bird species, including the endangered Japanese woodpecker. The resort is approximately 40 minutes by car from Hirosaki, and can also be accessed by a local bus service. The nearest train station is the JR Tsugaru-Goshogawara Station, which is approximately 25 minutes away by car.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63361195}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eduardo Kac\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eduardo Kac [\u025bdwardo\u028a k\u00e6ts; \u0115d\u00b7w\u00e2r\u2032\u00b7d\u014d k\u0103ts] (1962) is an American contemporary artist whose artworks span a wide range of practices, including performance art, poetry, holography, interactive art, telematic art and transgenic art. He is particularly well known for his works that integrate biotechnology, politics and aesthetics.\n\nKac began his art career in the early 1980s as performance artist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Within a few years he was involved in exploring holography as an interactive art form. At the same time, he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.\n\nBefore moving from Brazil to the United States in the late 1980s, Kac began creating his first telematic artworks that used electronic technologies to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, at the same time as he coined the phrase bioart. In addition to bioart Kac coined numerous neologisms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including holoart, transgenic art (the integration of human genes in an artwork) and plantimal, referring to a plant infused with human genes.\n\nKac is perhaps best known for his transgenic artworks that use biotechnology to intervene on the natural genetic structure of plants and animals. His works Time Capsule, GFP Bunny and Natural History of the Enigma in particular are recognized as notable works for having joined biotechnology, art and bioethics together into politically charged artworks.\n\nIn 2017 Kac collaborated with the French Space Observatory office to have a sculpture made aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA multidisciplinary artist, Kac has also employed poetry, fax, photocopying, photography, video, fractals, poetry, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, Morse code and DNA extraction in his practice.\n\nLife\nKac was born July 3, 1962 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985, and then at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received an MFA degree in 1990. In 2003 he received a doctorate from the University of Wales, Great Britain. Kac is a professor of art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nArt career\n\n1980s \nBetween 1980 and 1982, Kac belonged to a group that did performance art in the Cinelandia area of Rio de Janeiro. The performances, a response to the extreme conservative political climate of Brazil under military dictatorship, became known as  Movimento de Arte Porn\u00f4 (Porn Art Movement).\n\nBeginning in 1983, Kac created holographic poetry works, the first of which was HOLO/OLHO, named after the Portuguese word for \"eye\". 24 holographic poems followed this first work, including Quando (When?) (1987), a moebius-like work that could be read in two directions.\n\nAround the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French Minitel videotex terminals that were then in use in Rio. In 1985 he contributed one such work, Reabracadabra, to the Arte On Line exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in S\u00e3o Paulo. Other videotex animated poems by Kac include Recaos (1986), Tes\u00e3o (1985/86) and D/eu/s (1986). In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the Brasil High-Tech exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nFrom 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications performances that used Slow-scan television (SSTV)  and FAX technologies to create performances between separate locations.\n\nIn the late 80s Kac began work on his Ornitorrinco project, a telepresence artwork made in collaboration with Ed Bennett in Chicago. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot's camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.\n\nIn 1989 Kac moved from Brazil to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.\n\n1990s \nIn the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with Dialogical Drawing (1994) and Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two site in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation. The inclusion of a bird as part of its system, making it an early example of what Kac called transgenic art.\n\nIn Teleporting An Unknown State (1994\u201396), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by sunlight but by the internet viewers of the work. In practice, online viewers of the work triggered a video projection onto the plant of an image representing the sky in the viewer's home location.\n\nNotably, Kac coined the term \"bioart\" with his 1997 performance work Time Capsule. In Time Capsule, Kac implanted himself with an RFID chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian Gallery where Kac was performing, casing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so.\n\nBy the late 90s Kac defined himself either a \"transgenic artist\" or \"bio artist,\" and was using biotechnology and genetics to create provocative works that concomitantly explore scientific techniques and critique them.\n\nKac's next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled \"Genesis,\" involved him taking a quote from the Bible (Genesis 1:26 - \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth\"), transferring it into Morse code, and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics.\n\nParticipants were then able to shine ultraviolet lights onto the base pair of genetics thus altering it. So when Kac translated it back to English, it said something completely different. This work sparked a conversation about how meaning can change throughout translation.\n\n2000s\nIn one of his best known works, Alba, presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac claimed to have commissioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent rabbit; a rabbit implanted with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene from a type of jellyfish. Under a specific blue light, the rabbit fluoresces green. The work proved to be hugely controversial, which was later mitigated by the revelation that the GFP process was not new but was, rather,  already in use on rabbits at the lab in question.  Kac's original aim was for Alba to live with his family, but prior to the scheduled release of Alba to Kac, the lab retracted their agreement and decided that Alba should remain in the lab.\n\nHis work Natural History of the Enigma (2003-8) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a petunia, creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a plantimal. The plant, also given the name Eudinia (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac's DNA only with the plant's genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.\n\n2010s\nIn 2017 Kac collaborated with the French astronaut Thomas Pesquet to create an artwork in space called Inner Telescope. Following Kac's instructions, Pesquet cut and folded a piece of paper into a sculptural form that could be read as the three letters forming the French word for me, M-O-I.\n\nPermanent collections\nKac's work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Modern, London, Institut Valenci\u00e0 d'Art Modern in Valencia, Spain, Les Abattoirs  Toulouse, France, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Several of Kac's artists' books are included in the library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nAwards\nIn 1998 he received the Leonardo Award for Excellence from ISAST. In 1999, he received the Inter Communication Center (Tokyo) Biennial Award in 1999.\n\nIn 2002 he received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Emerging Fields.\n\nIn 2008 he received the Golden Nica award at Ars Electronica for his project Natural History of the Enigma.\n\nBibliography\nBooks by Eduardo Kac\n\n Kac, Eduardo.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vagenetia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vagenetia or Vagenitia () was a medieval region on the coast of Epirus, roughly corresponding to modern Thesprotia. The region likely derived its name from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai. It is first attested as a sclavinia under some sort of Byzantine control in the 8th/9th centuries, passed under Bulgarian rule in the late 9th century, and returned to Byzantine rule in the 11th. It passed to the Despotate of Epirus after 1204, where it formed a separate province. Vagenetia came under Albanian rule in the 1360s, until conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1430.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region's name derives from the Slavic tribe of the Baiounitai, who appear in the early 7th century during the Slavic invasions of the Balkans. Already during the 8th century, the Byzantine Empire tried to re-impose some control over the region, as a seal of office attests the presence of a civil governor (\"Theodore, basilikos spatharios and archon of Vagenitia\"), but the reading of the latter is not certain. Byzantine administration is securely attested towards the end of the 9th century, with the presence of both a bishop called Stephen in the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 879, and the seal of a civil governor (the basilikos protospatharios and archon Ilarion) from the turn of the 10th century. \n\nThe historian Predrag Komatina suggests that the bishopric was an \"ethnic\" bishopric for the Baiounitai (but with Greek-language liturgy), which then was succeeded by the Slavic-language episcopate of Clement of Ohrid (893\u2013916), which was not organized on a territorial, but on an ethnic basis, and had no fixed centre. Clement's roving episcopate was gradually replaced by bishoprics based in the various cities of the area. At the time of Clement's activity in the area, and during the early 10th century, Vagenetia and its wider area was ruled by the First Bulgarian Empire; thus the local church also became part of the Bulgarian Church, and later of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. The ultimate descendant of the bishopric of Vagenetia was likely the see of Himara.\n\nVagenetia is next mentioned in literary sources in the Alexiad, which describes how, in 1082, the Italo-Normans under Bohemund crossed the region to capture Ioannina. In the Partitio Romaniae of 1204, Vagenetia appears as a chartoularaton (a special district type indicating Slavic settlement) in the province of Dyrrhachium. \n\nIn 1205, it is listed by Marino Zeno, the Podest\u00e0 of Constantinople, among the territories accorded to the Republic of Venice by the Partitio. In Zeno's account, it is a separate province, distinct from Dyrrhachium, and in turn includes the chartoularaton of Glyky, north of Arta (which previously probably belonged to the Byzantine province of Nicopolis. Apart from the region of Dyrrhachium, however, the Venetians failed to consolidate their rule over most of the lands accorded to them in Epirus, and possession of Vagenetia passed to the Despotate of Epirus, where it is attested as a separate province (provincia in Latin, thema in Greek) within the Epirote state as early as the 1210 treaty between Michael I Komnenos Doukas and Venice. \n\nIn 1228, Theodore Komnenos Doukas confirmed possession of lands \"on the island of Corfu and the thema of Vagenetia\" to the Metropolitan of Corfu. In 1292, the coasts of the province were raided by Genoese ships in Byzantine employ, and two years later, the province was promised to Philip of Taranto as part of the dowry of Thamar Angelina Komnene. Still, the Despot of Epirus Thomas I Komnenos Doukas was ascribed the title of \"Duke of Vagenetia\" in a  Venetian document in 1313. In 1315, a document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople records that Vagenetia belonged to the bishopric of Himara.\n\nDuring the Albanian invasions of Epirus in the 1360s, many of the local Greeks fled to Ioannina. In 1382, the Albanian ruler John Spata gave the region, along with Bela and Dryinopolis, to his son-in-law Marchesino. In the early 1400s, the local Albanian ruler John Zenevisi is referred to in some Venetian documents as the \"sebastokrator of Vagenetia\". His grandson, Simon Zenevisi, with Venetian backing built the fortress of Strovili \"at the cape of Vagenetia\" across the island of Corfu in 1443.\n\nMost of Epirus fell under Ottoman rule in 1430, and in 1431, the Ottoman cadaster attests the existence of a province of Vayonetya. The name survived to the end of the century in various variants (Viyanite, Viyantiye), but the name vanishes thereafter, apart from a village Vagenetion south of Ioannina and an isolated reference to a \"Greater Vagenetia\" (\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) in the 17th century.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the historian Stojan Novakovi\u0107, followed by Peter Soustal and Johannes Koder in the Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Vagenetia was the coastal strip between the Ionian Sea and the Pindus Mountains that extended from Himara in the north to Margariti in the south. However, Komatina objects that these boundaries reflect the situation in the 13th\u201314th centuries, and that the earlier, original region, the chartoularaton of Vagenetia, was much smaller. Komatina points out that after 1205, Vagenetia came to include the district of Glyky to the south, but the original territory was just the northern part of the expanded province. Komatina identifies this with the territory referred to by John Apokaukos as \"Lesser Vagenetia\" (\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70 \u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1), namely the area around the valley of the Ao\u00f6s. This also corresponds to the Ottoman province, which comprised Himara and its hinterlands, with Delvina as its centre.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n \n\nMedieval Epirus\nHistorical regions in Albania\nHistorical regions in Greece\nThesprotia\nSclaveni\nProvinces of the Byzantine Empire\nSubdivisions of the Ottoman Empire\nDefunct dioceses of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople", "machine_text": " Vagenetia is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae, first described in 1830.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hohenfels-Essingen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hohenfels-Essingen is an Ortsgemeinde \u2013 a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality \u2013 in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nGeography \n\nThe municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588\u00a0m), the Alter Vo\u00df (588 m, with \u201cLiberation Beech\u201d) and the M\u00fchlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).\n\nHistory \nAs witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.\n\nRomans and Franks \nIn the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier.\n\nIn the district Im Keller (\u201cIn the Cellar\u201d) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.\n\nThe great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the \u201carmy kings\u2019\u201d (Heerk\u00f6nige) hands. The people who had lived here until now \u2013 Romanized Celts and Romans \u2013 either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.\n\n15th to 17th centuries \nEven before the Thirty Years' War, the M\u00fchlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain\u2019s south slope.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years\u2019 War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the M\u00fchlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.\n\n18th and 19th centuries \nAs a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one.\n\nIn November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat  in D\u00fcsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War.\n\nIn 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit \u2013 the Feuerberg in Hohenfels \u2013 was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.\n\n20th century to present \n\nAfter the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland.\n\nIn the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the M\u00fchlenberg.

The crypt contains the remains of a fifth-century Roman basilica. The site was originally occupied by a Roman fort.\n\nA new church was built on the site in early in 717 by Duke Adalbert of Alsace, brother of Saint Odile, as part of a new convent, in which he installed his daughter Attala as the first abbess.\n\nThe Church also served for many years as the episcopal seat for the north of Alsace.\n\nThe church was rebuilt in 1220 in Romanesque-Gothic style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, St Stephen's was a parish church, the parish of Stephen's being one of the nine parishes of Strasbourg. In 1534, as the reform was being introduced in Strasbourg, the parish of St Stephen's was transferred to St William's, on account of the opposition of the cannonesses of St Stephen's to the new teaching.\n\nIn the seventeenth century Louis XIV closed the abbey and transferred it to the Visitandines to serve as a boarding school for young women, a function which continued up until the French Revolution. In 1714 the church was equipped with an organ by Andreas Silbermann, which is now in Bischheim. After the French Revolution, the building was used as a warehouse, then as a theatre. In 1802, the church was deprived of its tower and in 1805 this was transformed into a theatre.\n\nThe college, of which the church now forms part, began life in 1861 as a 'Petit seminaire' (literally 'little seminary'), educating future priests as well as lay students.\n\nAllied bombing destroyed much of the building in 1944. Only the wide transept with its triple apse survived. In 1956, the ancient site was excavated and a Merovingian apse was discovered beneath the foundations of the old tower. In 1961, the nave was renovated, exposing the timber structures. The church was classified as a historical monument in 1962.\n\nIn 2016, the monumental concert organ from the former conservatory located in the National Theatre of Strasbourg was moved into the nave in order to be used as a church organ. The instrument, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, had been out of use since 1995. It was entirely restored by Quentin Blumenroeder from Haguenau.\n\nAs the Church is now part of a school, public access is only possible on special occasions, such as European Heritage Days. The school owns some valuable historical tapestries from the abbey church, some of which can be seen in the nearby Notre Dame museum.\n\nExternal links \n\n Eglise Saint Etienne - 2 rue de la Pierre Large on archi-wiki.org \n website of the Saint-Etienne college\n Aerial photo on French historical monuments website\n\nReferences\n\nRoman Catholic churches in Strasbourg\nRoman Catholic chapels in France\nRoman sites in France\nRomanesque architecture in France\nMonuments historiques of Bas-Rhin", "machine_text": " Saint Stephen's Church, Strasbourg In the early 13th century, the Dominicans arrived in Strasbourg and built a church and a convent on the west side of the city, on the banks of the Ill.

The church was completely destroyed in a fire in 1729, and was rebuilt in the classical style by Johann Adam Breunig, with the assistance of his brother, Johann Martin Breunig. The new church was completed in 1754. The interior of the church has a barrel vault with lunettes and a lowered arcade. The sanctuary is enclosed by a balustrade with consoles and vases. The choir is illuminated by a large bay window. The church has a Protestant atmosphere, due to the sober decoration and the lack of figurative statuary. The church was badly damaged in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when it was used as a military hospital. It was restored in 1876 by the architect CarlFv. Hiltmann. The Dominicans were chased out of the city by the French Revolutionaries, and the convent was used as a prison. In 1805, the church was given to the Lutheran community of Strasbourg. It has been Protestant since then.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 41012387}

The adults are composed of two parts, a cyst and a movable demosoma, the body. The cyst is made up of three layers of calcium carbonate exoskeleton, the outer layer is thick and has no sculpture, the middle layer is also exoskeleton but has a small sculpture, the inner layer is endoskeleton and has a radial symmetry. The demosoma is the movable part of the body, it is composed of a central disk with radial symmetry and five arms. The disk and the arms are made up of radial rows of plates which are connected by a flexible membrane, the so-called pellicle, which is the main organ of the demosoma. The pellicle is composed of radial rows of small plates connected by a thin membrane. The plates are small and numerous, they form a kind of basket which contracts and expands, allowing the demosoma to move. The arms are used for food collection, they are also used for locomotion, the animals move by bending the arms back and forth. The mouth is located in the center of the disk, and is surrounded by a group of tentacles. The Microcleidus are dioecious, the individuals are either all male or female. The eggs are laid in a basket shaped structure, which is brooded by the parent. The genus Microcleidus was erected by George Muir in 1961.

Its call sign was CKCL, broadcasting at 840 kilocycles, and owned by the Dominion Battery Company. As with many radio stations in the early years of radio broadcasting, the station changed frequencies a number of times in its first years of operation. It settled on 580 kHz frequency in 1931.\n\nIn 1945, the station was sold to Jack Kent Cooke's Toronto Broadcasting Co., and adopted the call sign CKEY. It was acquired in 1961 by Shoreacres Broadcasting, a consortium that included Westinghouse and The Globe and Mail. \nCKEY changed its frequency to 590 in 1964 as CKWW signed on at 580 that year in Windsor and CKAR, (known today as CFBK-FM), in Huntsville had to change its frequency from 590 to 630\u00a0kHz.\n\nTop 40\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, CKEY was the leading Top 40 competitor to 1050 CHUM.  One of its DJs was later CFNY staple David Marsden, known as Dave Mickie at CKEY (and later at CHUM as well). Another notable broadcaster was Bryan Fustukian, broadcasting as Vik Armen.

Shoreacres, in turn, was acquired by Maclean-Hunter in 1966.\n\nA transmitter for CKEY was once located on Midland Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East in Scarborough. This site was sold to the Scarborough Board of Education in 1964 to build Tabor Park Vocational School for the area's redevelopment.  From 1972 until the 1990s, CKEY's and then CKYC's offices and studios were located in the Toronto Star building at One Yonge Street.\n\nMOR and Oldies\nFrom 1970 to 1984, CKEY featured Charles Templeton and Pierre Berton on the commentary show Dialogue with Templeton also reading the morning news for several years.

The following morning at 9, the station adopted a country format, changing its call sign to CKYC. The CKEY call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Fort Erie.\n\nFrequency Swap\nAfter Rogers Communications acquired Maclean-Hunter in 1994, CKYC was sold to Telemedia. Telemedia subsequently swapped CKYC's frequency with that of its sports outlet CJCL. On February 6, 1995, at 10 AM, CKYC ceased airing country music, and after stunting with a ticking clock for two hours, CJCL and CKYC swapped frequencies. \n\nCKYC subsequently aired only syndicated programming until it went off the air permanently in late 1996.\n\nCHKT Signs On\nCHKT was launched as an ethnic, multilingual radio station by Fairchild Group in 1997, over the 1430 AM frequency that had been occupied by CKYC immediately prior to its signing off for the last time.  The CKYC call sign was subsequently picked up by a station in Owen Sound in 2001.\n\nIn October 2019, Fairchild Radio gained public attention when it fired a Toronto radio talk-show host allegedly because of his questions during an interview perceived as critical of the Chinese government's stance on the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Fairchild Radio\n Remembering CKEY Radio Toronto - 580 - 590\n CHKT history - Canadian Communications Foundation\n \n\nHKT\nCHKT\nCHKT\nHKT\n1925 establishments in Ontario", "machine_text": " CHKT The CHKT is an ISO-4217 international bank currency code that corresponds to the Cuban convertible peso.

It was published on the App Store on 15 September 2013 for iOS.\n\nGameplay \n\nSimilar to Pocket Planes, the game focuses on running a transportation network system. The player starts with small steam trains of limited fuel and speed that can carry a small amount of cargo, and/or passenger cars. Earning coins from delivering jobs, the player slowly expands their rail network to include more cities and better trains. Like Pocket Planes, Pocket Trains uses real cities around the world and has quasi-realistic costs to purchase tracks and cities relative to the real world.\n\n\"Jobs\" are single delivery tasks offered to trains. They are priced based on the distance from the originating station to the destination. Although multiple jobs may be headed to the same destination, different types of jobs may be more profitable than others. Jobs can be held at stations for transfer between trains or for later transport.\n\nCertain jobs involve the delivery of \"Crates\", which are placed into the player's inventory upon delivery. Crates can be opened using the second currency 'Bux' and contain parts for trains that can be built once all the necessary components are achieved.\n\nThere are also special jobs that earn the player a secondary in-game currency called \"Bux\". This currency can be used to buy coins, allow more jobs to be held in yards at stations, speed up trains, and open crates. Bux can also be purchased with money.\n\nCrates, Coins and Bux can also be received by watching the train travel screen, and tapping on the resources as they pass by.\n\nReception \n\nPocket Trains has been received well by critics. Metacritic described it as a \"fun ride\", giving it an aggregated score of 76/100. Toucharcade rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying it was \"yet another fun title\" when comparing it to Pocket Planes. Gamezebo also rated it 4.5/5 stating it was a \"charming, highly addictive\" game. Pocket Gamer rated it 7/10, calling it an \"impressively simple time-waster\", but noting that it \"is a little too similar to its airborne predecessor\", referring to Pocket Planes.

It was written in 1979 but was not published until 1990, after the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nSummary \nIt is the story of a day in the life of a nameless East German woman whose apartment and occupational activity are openly watched by the Stasi.  The story raises the subject of surveillance, particularly the feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, and the disturbances it causes in everyday life; symptoms of fear and nervousness, such as unrest, sleeplessness, weight-loss, and hair-loss. Her daily routine is shaped around this surveillance. She trusts no one and suspects everyone.  No conversation can be held within her apartment without the telephone jack being pulled to prevent calls from having unwanted listeners. Telephone calls are a fa\u00e7ade, where only code words and petty banter take place. She becomes obsessed with her observers. Who are they? Who sent them? Do they have normal lives? Are they normal people outside their jobs?\n\nAs a first-person narrative, the reader is transported into the author's inner monologue and introspection. By the end of the story she is very much influenced by the guests at her manuscript reading, young adults by whom the establishment feels threatened and remove by force. The main character realizes that the youth are watching and writing everything down. There is hope and one day she will be able to speak of this time and her experiences freely.

The work is notable for being the basis of the computer game Barrow Hill. What Remains is set in a future where the world's major cities are run by a series of powerful, semi-mythical men known as The Council. The Council has been formed by five powerful business men, former heads of state and the like, who have agreed to work together to save the world from itself. To do so, they have put aside their differences and rivalries to concentrate on the greater good. Or so they say. The novella focuses on one of The Council's main employees, a man known as The Administrator. The Administrator is responsible for carrying out The Council's decisions, and is the main protagonist of the story. He is a complex character, and is depicted in various lights throughout the story, some of which hint at a dark past which has led him to his current position. The Administrator is assisted, and sometimes hindered, by a woman known as The Butler. The Butler is the Administrator's assistant, and she carries out his orders. She is also the vessel which contains The Council's consciousness, or \"The Network\". The Network is an artificial intelligence which has been created by The Council, and which controls the major cities. It is The Network which actually runs the cities, with The Council and the Administrator merely giving it direction. The story is set in and around a city called Barrow Hill. Barrow Hill is a mythical city, said to have been built by the British military as a showcase for the application of their new technologies. The city was never meant to be lived in, and as such it is a very sterile environment. The city is also highly secured, with a series of high-tech defense systems designed to keep the public out. In the story, the city has been taken over by The Council, and is being used as a headquarters from which they can control the other cities. The Council has four other major cities under its control, each one containing a different aspect of The Network. These cities are: New York, Los Angeles, Moscow and Hong Kong.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34541087}

He attended Truro School on a scholarship and excelled in languages, going on to graduate with a first in French and German from Oriel College, Oxford. He then moved to Queen's College to study for a D.Phil. in 18th-century French literature.\n\nHouse of Commons career\nHe became a clerk in the Commons Library in 1954. When given responsibility for the research area in 1964 he introduced a system of comprehensive daily briefings for MPs, and he was promoted to Deputy Librarian in 1967. When Speaker George Thomas appointed him 10th Librarian of the Commons Library in 1976, he began a process of modernisation. He set up the Public Information Office (now the House of Commons Information Office) in 1978, and electronic publication began the same year, when the Library contributed to the Prestel viewdata system, which at one time had 90,000 subscribers. Computerisation of the Library's information systems began in 1979 with the creation of the Parliamentary On-Line Information System (POLIS). He also established a service for schools. The new systems introduced by Menhennet enabled MPs to find and check information far more easily, and were used particularly often by Gordon Brown and Tony Blair while in opposition.\n\nMenhennet hosted international conferences at Westminster, and also acted as an adviser to other parliaments. His last reform was to ban smoking in the library.\n\nOther activities\nIn 1964 Menhennet was a founder member of the Study of Parliament Group, and also chaired the British Library's Advisory Committee on Bibliographic Services from 1986 to 1992. He also wrote a number of books about Parliament. After his retirement in 1991 he was a visiting research fellow at Goldsmith's College.\n\nMenhennet was a life Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a freeman of the City of London and a liveryman of the Stationer's Company.

Menhennet was born in London in 1922, the son of Jewish parents, Jack and Kate (Katz) Menhennet. His father was from a family of Russian Jews who had moved to Britain in the 1890s, and his mother was from a family of Polish Jews who had moved to Britain in the early 20th century. He was educated at University College School, London, and then at University College, London, where he read medicine. He graduated in 1944, and then did a PhD in 1953 on the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. In 1951, Menhennet was part of a team that discovered the vector for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the cause of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a discovery for which he was awarded the Sir Ronald Ross Prize. The team consisted of himself, David C. Bruce, William C. Campbell, and Malcolm C. Meikle. The team's discovery was made possible by a chance observation by Campbell, who was working on a different disease at the time. Campbell noticed that the blood of patients with African trypanosomiasis had a higher concentration of a protein than the blood of healthy individuals. This protein was later found to be specific for the parasite, and could be used to detect the infection.

The ventral side is dark brown to grey and also spotted. The snout is compressed dorsally and truncated. The tail is compressed laterally and ridged. Each hind limb has four toes, and the gills are dull red and bushy. Sexually active males have sowled cloacae and two enlarged cloacal papillae that point to the rear. Males and females are of a similar size. Adults measure 16.5\u201328.0\u00a0cm from the tip of snout to tip of tail. The young possess a dorsal stripe along their length along with a dark lateral stripe.\n\nMales and females become sexually mature after reaching 102\u00a0mm and 100\u00a0mm, respectively, measured from tip of the snout to the posterior end of the cloaca. This size is reached at 5.5 years in males and 6.5 years in females.\n\nHabitat\n\nNeuse River waterdogs prefer streams with a flow >10\u00a0cm/s and streams which are >15 m wide, and 1 m deep, in areas with a hard clay or soil bottom, as well as areas covered with leaf bed. Larvae are found in leaf beds of quieter waters which provide cover and foraging sites. Males have a greater range than females, and both males and females increase their range after moderate rains, but decrease it after large rains (>40\u00a0mm). During winter, adults mostly reside in burrows in banks or under granite rocks. During the spring, the adults move to large bedrock outcrops or beneath large boulders in relatively fast current where nesting occurs. Home ranges contain animal burrows or rock overhangs, large flat rocks on sand gravel substrates, and slack-water areas with detritus mats of leaves.\n\nAdults create retreats by shoveling sand and gravel with their snouts, forming a cavity beneath cover objects. Sometimes, gravel is picked up in the mouth and moved to the periphery of the retreat. Entrances to these retreats face downstream. Females, and to a lesser extent males, actively defend their retreats from intruders. Threat displays include flaring and pulsating the gills and curling the upper lip. Intruders which do not flee after this display are attacked and bitten, usually on the end of the tail.\n\nReproduction\nMales have sperm in the vasa deferentia from November through May, and females have been found with this sperm from December through May. Females move to nesting sites beneath fast-moving current during the spring. Oviposition occurs in April and May, corresponding to the time when ovarian eggs reach their maximum size. Eggs are 8\u20139\u00a0mm in diameter and attach to the substrate by a blunt stalk.\n\nCourtship\nA pair of Neuse River waterdogs crawl slowly, with the male trailing the female by 2\u20134\u00a0cm. The male positions his snout behind the rear legs of the female when she stops. The female has her gills flared, while the male has his close to the neck.  The male then moves across her body at the base of her tail. Once parallel, the male begins to stroke the female with his chin. This stroking begins at the top of the head, moves roughly halfway down the female and back to the head. The female then raises her head each time the male's chin contacts her neck or head. This sequence repeats many times over a period of roughly 18 minutes. The male then circles the female in a clockwise direction while maintaining contact with her. After several slow circles are made, the males moves parallel to the female and places his limbs over her back. The pair remains in this position for 30 minutes and retreats.\n\nDiet and feeding\nAdults feed from the mouths of their retreats or move about in search of prey at night. Olfaction and sight play important roles in locating food. Animals are active away from cover at night, and also during raised water levels and increased turbidity. Individuals are inactive when stream temperatures exceed 18\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nAdults mainly prey on snails, earthworms, isopods, amphipods, mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, true flies, and fish. Other prey include: slugs, leeches, spiders, crayfish, centipedes, millipedes, odonates, hellgrammites, beetles, caterpillars, and salamanders. Prey of larvae are mainly ostracods, copepods, mayflies, true flies, and beetles. Other prey items of larva include: earthworms, caldocerans, isopods, amphipods, collembolans, odonates, and stoneflies along with other insects.\n\nPredation\nMainly preyed on by fish, Neuse River waterdogs produce chemical defenses to ward off these predators.\n\nReferences\nPetranka, James W.

From June 2004 to July 2005, 8390 students were enrolled in the Bright Flight program, which totaled over $15 million in state expenditures.\n\nQualifications and renewal\nTo qualify for the Bright Flight maximum award of $3000 per year, a student must be in the top 3% of his or her statewide high school class as determined by normalized tests, the ACT and SAT composite scores. To date and for several years, a score of 31 or above on the ACT or an SAT-equivalent score qualifies, but the score can change each year.  A composite score of 31 will be needed to qualify for the college freshmen in the 2020\u20132021 school year.\nThe law also qualifies students in the 4th and 5th percentiles to receive a $1000 per year maximum scholarship; however, the Missouri Legislature has not funded this award in recent years, and these students have received no actual financial award.  An ACT composite score of 30 (or above) qualified for the 4th and 5th percentile for college freshmen in the 2020\u20132021 school year and recent years.\nTo continue receiving the scholarship, students must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA in college and maintain full-time student status to renew the scholarship, which can be renewed for up to five years.\nStudents must not be pursuing a degree in theology or divinity.  \nBright Flight students must attend school continuously.  They cannot cease attending school, except to work for a non-profit organization, hold a government job, or serve in the armed services. Academic interruption must not exceed 27 months.\n\nHistory\nAppropriated by the Missouri General Assembly in 1986, students initially received a statutory maximum of $2000 per year.  Many students and higher education officials have observed that tuition expenses at the University of Missouri, for example, were below $2000 in 1987 and thus were fully covered by Bright Flight at its introduction. In 2017, following a period of increases in tuition expenses that easily outpaced inflation, Bright Flight covered only a fraction of the more than $11,000 a typical student spent on tuition at the University of Missouri.\n\nRecent developments\n\nOn August 12, 2010, state budget cuts reduced the amount from $2000/year to $1500/year for that year.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced at a college preparatory school in Kansas City, Missouri that he included a proposal in Missouri's 2015 budget that would offer an option to receive up to $5,000 extra per year if recipients stayed in Missouri after finishing college for the number of years they received Bright Flight.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Universities in Missouri received an email from the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development that noted, \u201cThe General Assembly appropriated $20,176,666 in Bright Flight funds for state fiscal year 2021.  However, based on current economic conditions the Governor has restricted almost $6.5 million of those funds, significantly reducing the amount of funds available to the program.  As a result, the estimated Bright Flight award amounts have been reduced from $3,000 to $1,800 to ensure expenditures do not exceed the available funds.  We regret the impact this unavoidable reduction will have on students and we will consider a mid-year increase to award amounts if the restricted funds are released.

(Prior to that, Ogunquit had been a village within the town of Wells.)\n\nThroughout 2008 and 2009, in an effort to comply with the state's 2008 school consolidation law, the district attempted to find another district to merge with, in order to form a Regional School Unit. Wells-Ogunquit explored merging with MSAD 71 (Kennebunk-Kennebunkport), as well as the York and Kittery school departments, but was unable to reach an agreement with any of them.  Wells-Ogunquit submitted a waiver application to the state, which was rejected. The state then recommended that Wells-Ogunquit merge with the Acton School Department, despite the substantial geographic distance between Acton and the Wells-Ogunquit area.  Under the pressure of a deadline from the state, the towns of Acton, Ogunquit, and Wells held referendums to determine whether voters would approve or deny the consolidation.  Voters in all three towns rejected the plan.

But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. 8:5\u201313 And when the disciples had entered into the ship, they went to him, saying, Master, the sea is tossed with waves, and the wind bloweth hard. And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm. And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him. And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. 8:14\u201321 And he went up into a mountain, and sat there. And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. Then Jesus answering said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. 8:22\u201326 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4770637}

His later years were devoted to the production of animated cartoons in Canada. After firing Shamus Culhane from the animator's supervising director job on Rocket Robin Hood, director Ralph Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita were brought to Toronto, not knowing that Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit.\n\nFailing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Constitution of Uruguay\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Constitution of Uruguay () is the supreme law of Uruguay. Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004.\n\nUruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year-long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a federation: the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Mediated by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo allowed to build the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. It has been reformed in 1918, 1934, 1942, 1952 and 1967, but it still maintains several articles from its first version of 1830.\n\nVersions\n\nOriginal Constitution (1830 - 1918) \n\nWhen it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (Rep\u00fablica Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution.\n\nLike all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (C\u00e1mara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (C\u00e1mara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio pol\u00edtico, or impeachment, of the ministers for \"unacceptable conduct\".\n\nAs established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter \u2013 with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts \u2013 appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos).\n\nAlthough the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called \"pacts between the parties.\" This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipaci\u00f3n), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872.\n\nThe anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay.\n\nSecond Constitution (1918 - 1934) \n\nIn 1913 President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (1903\u201307, 1911\u201315), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917.\n\nThe history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one.\n\nThird Constitution (1934 - 1942) \n\nThe 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members.\n\nThe constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931\u201338). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government.\n\nFourth Constitution (1942 - 1951) \n\nUruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942.\n\nFifth Constitution (1951 - 1967) \n\nOn 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin.\n\nA fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement.\n\nSixth Constitution (1967 - 1997) \n\nIn the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.\n\nDictatorial period (1973-1985) \nIn 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Naci\u00f3n) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.\n\nBack to institutionality \nIn 1985, Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989.\n\nCurrent (1997 - present) \n\nThe 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967.\n\nThe most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.\n\nSee also \n Uruguay\n Politics of Uruguay\n Constitution\n Constitutional law\n Constitutional economics\n Constitutionalism\n Elections in Uruguay\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Text of the Constitution including the reforms of 1989, 1994, 1996 y 2004 (in Spanish)\n \n\n \nUruguay\nPolitics of Uruguay\nUruguayan law", "machine_text": " Constitution of Uruguay The Constitution of Uruguay was enacted in 1917, and has been amended several times since then. The constitution is a set of fundamental principles and established legal procedures according to which the country is governed. The Constitution of Uruguay was adopted on 18 March 1917, during the administration of President Baltasar Brum. The constitution was drafted by a constitutional committee created in 1912, which was composed of representatives of all the parties in the National Assembly, and its text was submitted to a popular referendum in 1916, where it was approved by a large majority. The Constitution of Uruguay is one of the most democratic in the world, and is considered one of the most liberal in Latin America. It is based on the principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and on the idea that the people have the right to determine their own destiny. The constitution guarantees the right to life, liberty, and security, as well as the right to participate in the government. The constitution also establishes the structure of the government, which is composed of three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is elected by popular vote and is the head of state and government. The legislative branch is composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives, which is elected by popular vote, and the Senate, which is elected by indirect vote. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country. The Constitution of Uruguay has been amended several times since it was first enacted. The first amendment was made in 1933, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the National Security Council. The second amendment was made in 1942, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Court of Accounts. The third amendment was made in 1952, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Office of the General Comptroller. The fourth amendment was made in 1967, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Superior Council of the Judiciary. The fifth amendment was made in 1992, when the constitution was modified to allow for the creation of the Office of the Special Secretary for the Prevention of Money Laundering.

It had a population of 736 as of the 2016 census.  The name Pugwash is derived from the Mi'kmaq word, Pakwesk (also written as Pagw\u0115sk) meaning \"a shoal\", in reference to a reef near the mouth of the harbour.\n\nThe village is home to fishing, salt mining, and small-scale manufacturing, and tourism. Pugwash sits atop a salt deposit measuring  thick and is home to the largest underground salt mine in Atlantic Canada, with shipments from its port, as well as by rail from a facility at Oxford Junction.\n\nHistory\nThe end of glaciation began 13,500 years ago and ended with the region becoming largely ice-free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation.\n\nThe Pugwash area is part of the Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki territory of the Mi\u2019kmaq, who have inhabited their traditional lands these 13,500 years. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Mi\u2019kmaw lived in and around what is now the Northumberland Shore, including Pugwash. West Pugwash is shown as \"Indian land\" on early post-settlement maps of the area. There are many Mi\u2019kmaq who live in the area today.\n\nThe Chignecto peninsula was settled by Acadians from the 1660s onward, this period ended with the with Expulsion and th Bay of Fundy Campaign during the French and Indian War. Wallace and near-by Tatamagouche were the first villages in Acadia to be burned because they were important port through which Acadians supplied the French Fortress Louisbourg.\n\nBritish colonial settlement began with the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists, coming to Chignecto in 1790, and then with the Seaman family, formerly of New York State, moving to farm the mouth of River Phillip in 1795, and ultimately purchasing what became the Pugwash town site from the Mi'kmaw in 1802.\n\nPugwash is also home of many descendants of Highland Scots who immigrated to the region in the 19th century. All street signs in the town are bilingual, with both English and Gaelic translations. The village celebrates its Scottish heritage each July 1, with the annual Gathering of the Clans and Fisherman's Regatta. The Pugwash area, and indeed the entire north shore of Nova Scotia, is famed for its warm waters and sandy beaches. Some claim the waters in summer here are the warmest waters north of the Carolinas in the United States.\n\nThe Crowley Memorial was erected in 1870 at Pugwash, Nova Scotia by the Legislature of Nova Scotia in honour of Mary E. Crowley, who died October 1869, aged 12 years after rescuing her younger brother and sister from a house fire. This is believed to be the first public monument ever erected to a woman in Canada.\n\nIn 1898 a fire destroyed the entire town leaving 1200 people homeless, with the New York Times reporting  200 dwellings, 5 churches, 20 stores, 3 hotels, and several mills\" were destroyed, and that the \"town was little insured.\"\n\nPugwash is famous for being the site of an international conference of scholars organized by Bertrand Russell in 1957, and hosted by Pugwash's native son, steel magnate Cyrus Eaton (1883\u20131979), at the lodge on property owned by the Pugwash Park Commission located at the north end of Water Street in the village.  This conference brought high-level scientists from both sides of the Cold War divide to state their opposition to nuclear weapons.  This meeting was a follow-up to an earlier statement of notables whose signatories had included Albert Einstein and Linus Pauling, the Russell-Einstein Manifesto. The name Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs has since been used to refer to the group.\n\nA myth about the village is that the children's cartoon character Captain Pugwash was named after the international organization that takes its name from the town, but the character, a pirate, in fact first appeared in 1950, several years before the planning of the first Pugwash conference took place.\n\nToday \nVisitors entering Pugwash were once greeted by roadside signs announcing that they were entering the \"Home of the Thinkers,\" but the signs have since been replaced by a newer slogan \"World Famous for Peace\".  The switch was made in response to the 1995 awarding of the Nobel Prize to the International Pugwash conferences \"for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and in the longer run to eliminate such arms\".\n\nThe village has an elementary school, named after Cyrus Eaton, as well as a regional high school that draws students from around rural Cumberland County. Pugwash has a farmers market that runs on Saturdays during the summer months.\n\nThe Pugwash railway station is now a library.  The building was designed by Sir Sandford Fleming and completed in 1892, is a registered historic site under the Heritage Property Act of Nova Scotia.\n\nThe village was hit by a tornado in 1999, a rarity in Nova Scotia.\n\nEconomy \nPugwash sits on the dividing line between two fishing areas making it the only place on the Northumberland Strait to have two fishing seasons. The first one takes place in May and June and the second in mid-August and mid-October. Many boats fish out of the Pugwash harbour, carrying up to 300 lobster traps at a time.\n\nThe Village is home of the Canadian Salt Company Mine the only salt mine and only underground mine in Nova Scotia. This mine has been open since 1959. The majority of the mine runs under the Pugwash River, some under solid ground, but none under the village. The plant produces industrial grades salt, salt blocks for farm use and refined salt for domestic consumption. The mine produces approximately 1,200,000 tones of salt per year.

The name \"Pugwash\" is derived from the Mi'kmaq word Pagwe'ak, meaning \"deep water\", \"still water\" or \"water that has a current\". The area was first settled by the Mi'kmaq, and then by the French in the 17th century. The village was founded in the late 18th century by United Empire Loyalists. The local economy is based on agriculture, although a few people are employed in the fishing and forestry industries.

It dealt with intelligence matters concerning British naval plans, and with the collection of naval intelligence in regard to coastal defences, foreign powers, mobilisation, trade and war.\n\nHistory\nThe Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.\n\nThe NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.\n\nIn 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff\u2014a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887\u2014an intelligence collection and collation organisation.\n\nIn 1912 the department was restructured with most of its divisions and functions being absorbed within the Admiralty War Staff organisation the department was abolished and re-emerged as the Naval Intelligence Division of the new department.\n\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence\nDirectors of Naval Intelligence included:\n Captain William Henry Hall, 1887\u20131889\n Rear-Admiral Cyprian Bridge, 1889\u20131894\n Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895\u20131899\n Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899\u20131902\n Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902\u20131905\n Captain Charles Ottley, 1905\u20131907\n Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, 1907\u20131909\n Rear-Admiral Alexander Bethell, 1909\u20131912\n\nAssistant directors\nIncluded:\nAssistant Director Mobilisation Division\n Captain Reginald N.

It is the most distinguished part of the Hellenic Police. It was formed in 1978 when two counter-terrorist units were created within the two police divisions that existed then (Hellenic Gendarmerie and the Cities Police), which were united into a single body in 1984, the Hellenic Police. In the beginning the Unit had only 150 men, but when Greece became the host country of the 2004 Summer Olympics their number increased to 200 after reassessing the needs for the magnitude of the event.\n\nTraining \nThe EKAM force is based in Athens, but have several detachments spread throughout Greece's major cities. Each officer is a full-time member who must have at least five years on the force before being allowed to try out. Many receive training from the Greek Army's Ranger School before going on to the police counter-terrorism school.\n\nThe Special Suppressive Antiterrorist Unit of the Hellenic Police follows a three-month training program every year. For its training modern, purpose-built facilities are being used. Training can also take place in other locations such as buildings in urban or rural areas (inhabited or not), the Athens International Airport, planes of Olympic Airways, the Piraeus port infrastructure, the Hellenic Railroad system, the Athens Metro. Other places that have been decided as suitable to cover its training needs can also be used.

It has confronted challenges such as hostage situations and it has contributed in the arrests of many dangerous criminals. The EKAM played a key role in the dismantling of the November 17 and Revolutionary People's Struggle terrorist organizations. In March 2003, it confronted successfully an incident on a Turkish Aeroplane which was hijacked while it flew from Istanbul to Ankara (flight no. 160) and ended up at the Athens International Airport at the order of the hijacker.

In 1997, Rahman and a partner started a company that installed cameras in daycare centers, allowing parents to watch the video streams online in real time. Edaycare.com attracted $2.5 million from investors, including Ron Conway, an early stage investor of Google and PayPal. A year later Rahman and his partner ran out of money, forcing them to sell the company for stock that was beneficially worthless.\n\nNaseeb Networks, Inc.\nAfter a hiatus of four years and working as a consultant, Rahman decided to start a social networking site for Muslims in the United States and United Kingdom, after looking at the success of similar website Friendster.com. He named it \"Naseeb.com\" (meaning \"destiny\"). Built as a social site, it was considered more of match-making portal, but Rahman said, \"I decided not to go head-on as a matchmaking site... 'Dating' has a negative stigma from a Muslim viewpoint.\" Naseeb.com was then invested in by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman with $25,000, while Mark Pincus of Zynga and Joe Kraus of Excite also stepped in as angel investors.\n\nDescribing the inspiration behind Naseeb, Rahman said, \"I was exploring the Pakistani market since my family had moved here. I realized that the biggest cost in running a web company was of human capital. And the running cost in Pakistan would have been 1/18th of what it would have been in the US. So that's when I decided to come back and start Naseeb.com, which exploded very quickly. We were the first one to be doing any kind of serious business on the internet back then. And we had little to no competition in the market.\"\n\nIn 2002, Rahman returned to Pakistan and registered his company as Naseeb Networks, Inc., both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in San Jose, California, US, to make it easier to raise money and investors. He spent $60,000 as a startup cost for Naseeb and initially handled the company on his own. To prime the market, he used equity in the company to buy the electronic greeting card site eidmubarak.com, which allow Muslims to send cards for Eid, a Muslim holiday. Three thousand people from the site's 1-million-strong mailing list signed up immediately. Annual memberships cost $40, and by 2005 the website was generating $300,000 in revenue.\n\nWith the expansion of company Rahman needed programmers and developers, and buying ads in local newspapers was expensive. He recalls, \"I started Naseeb.com from my house, but later moved out as we grew. Now when hiring, I ran into a lot of problems finding the right talent. At that time, one job ad in the classified section in Dawn News, roughly cost PKR 850,000 which was ridiculous! So I decided to put my ads online.\"\n\nRozee.pk\n \nIn 2005, Rahman built a \"quick and dirty\" job site to post job openings for his parent company Naseeb Networks. Many other companies contacted Rahman to post their companies' and products' ads on his website. Rahman agreed to post their ads free of cost to help boost Naseeb's traffic. After receiving such a reception, the website became the primary business of Naseeb Networks.\n\nRahman then offered the largest companies the ability to search for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, as well as software to power their own companys' job boards and the right to post their logos on the front page of his new site. He named it \"Rozee\", an Urdu language word which means \"livelihood\", or translates roughly as \"blessed livelihood.\"\n\nIn 2007 Rozee.pk went into a completely functioning state, generating more traffic than Naseeb. Rahman used Naseeb's proceeds, and $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and ePlanet Ventures, to hire salespeople to go after large corporate clients, most of which still advertised job openings in newspapers. More than 63 000 companies actively post openings on Rozee.pk, paying between $29 for a single ad and up to $20,000 for a suite of services.\n\nRozee.pk has been listed as the number one employment website in Pakistan, with more than 65 thousand companies posting jobs, 32.53 million applications processed and 6 million unique visitors every day. In 2015, Rozee.pk won $6.5 million of investment from Vostok Nafta and Piton Capital, bringing the company's total venture capital funding to $8.5 million.\n\nIn an interview Rahman stated, \"As talent continues to move online at a rapid pace in emerging markets, businesses need increasingly sophisticated recruiting technology customized to nuanced local market dynamics.\"\n\nIt was the latest in a series of large venture capital investments in Pakistan over the previous year and a half. Managing director Per Brilioth said, \"We are excited to partner with Naseeb Networks and impressed with what Rahman and his team have achieved in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia... We believe these markets present massive growth opportunities and are looking forward to working with the team to expand the reach of Naseeb Networks' world-class products and services.\" Michael Porter of AllWorld Network listed the company as one of Pakistan's fastest growing private companies. American writer Elmira Bayrasli visited Pakistan in 2010 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of the country and listed Rahman as an \"example to entrepreneurs\" in her 2015 book, From the Other Side of the World. She claimed that the \"next Silicon Valley could be in Lahore, Mumbai or Istanbul.\"\n\nChalo.pk\nIn 2011, Rahman launched a location-based online shopping portal that features \"local daily deals and listings for the most affordable things to do, place to eat, and brands to buy\" in cities throughout Pakistan. Rahman said, \"Chalo is my experiment. We have hundreds of SMEs in Pakistan who can't afford to promote themselves on large platforms like newspapers, billboards, TV etc. We're helping them expand & grow through Chalo.pk... We're also experimenting with Maps. We spent 2 years building our own maps database, and now we have mapped every single house address in any planned society in Lahore. We\u2019ve also mapped all the restaurants, their menus and other details in the app. So people can navigate to them really easily. If you want to watch a movie, we're listing all the movies being shown in all the cities, and soon we'll be adding a Buy button.\"\n\nDigital Publishers Association of Pakistan\nIn 2012, Rahman co-founded the Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), with several publications and portal owners including Masood Hamid (President), Monis Rahman (Vice President), Sarmad A. Ali (Member Executive Committee), Lucas Peter (Secretary General), Imran Ansari (Joint Secretary), Qudratullah Shahab (Member Executive Committee), and Sarah Sohail (Finance Secretary). The association aims to \"safeguard interests of all stakeholders in the burgeoning digital market and create a regulated playing field.\"\n\nMihnati.com acquisition\nIn 2013, Rozee.pk bought Saudi employment website Mihnati.com for an undisclosed amount. Discussing the acquisition, Rahman said, \"We have merged both Rozee.pk and Mihnati by migrating all Mihnati employers and jobseekers on to the Rozee.pk technology platform. By doing this, we gave our Saudi sales team a far more powerful product to sell with more features.\"\n\nOther works and future ventures\nAfter establishing himself, Rahman served as a head or partner of several technology firms in Pakistan, including as a member of the board of directors at Kashf Microfinance Bank Limited  (2010-2012), and of the Pakistan Advisory Board at Acumen Fund (2010-2013). Currently he is a member of the Young Presidents' Organization (2010) Governing Board (CEC) at Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITES (P@SHA) (2013), Secretary General and founding member at Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), and a member of the Global Board of Trustees (BoT) at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE, Lahore) (2012).\n\nRahman is regarded as one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. Many have listed him in their top ten lists of CEOs and entrepreneurs. In 2016, Rahman was listed among the top CEOs of Pakistan, was placed at No. 6 among the Top 10 Most Influential Tech Leaders of Pakistan, and was ranked at #3 among the \"Top 5 E-commerce Business Tycoons of Pakistan\". Rahman is a TED speaker and is frequently invited to talk on entrepreneurship and Internet marketing at the world's top business schools and conferences.\n\nIn 2016, Rahman together with Qasif Shahid developed a digital mobile wallet to increase digital payments' scale rapidly. The mobile wallet is telco, bank and handset agnostic with the philosophy of inter-operating collaboratively with existing payment plumbing. It is jointly funded by Finca Microfinance Bank and the e-company Finja. In an interview Qasif said, \"We believe banking products should look more like social networks than conventional banking products.\"  Rahman said, \"Our mobile wallet's open API platform will allow much needed collaborative creativity from other FinTechs to be leveraged to create building blocks for a wider array of useful financial products.\"\n\nAwards and honors\n 2008: International Data Group CIO Pakistan Pioneer in Innovation Award\n 2011: Forbes \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\"\n 2012: Pakistan Power 100 Excellence Award\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Rahman's profile at Rozee.pk\n \n Rahman at Naseeb Networks, Inc.\n\nLiving people\nBusinesspeople in computing\nPakistani computer businesspeople\nStanford University alumni\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni\nPakistani expatriates in Saudi Arabia\nPakistani expatriates in the United States\nPakistani venture capitalists\nSilicon Valley people\nPakistani company founders\nBusinesspeople from Lahore\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": " Monis Rahman is a British Pakistani entrepreneur, founder of UKFinances.com, and former CEO of Gatecoin, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George W. M. Reynolds\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George William MacArthur Reynolds (23 July 1814 \u2013 19 June 1879) was a British fiction writer and journalist.\n\nReynolds was born in Sandwich, Kent, the son of Captain Sir George Reynolds, a flag officer of the Royal Navy. Reynolds was educated first at Dr. Nance's school in Ashford, Kent, and then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was intended for a career in the British Army, but his parents died during 1829 and, with his subsequent inheritance, he decided to quit the military and devote himself instead to literary pursuits. He left Sandhurst on 13 September 1830 and for the next few years he traveled a great deal, particularly in France, and became a naturalised French citizen. He began residence in Paris in 1834, where he started a daily English newspaper. The venture failed, and Reynolds returned bankrupt to England in 1836.\n\nReynolds served as editor of The Teetotaler (a weekly journal advocating teetotalism) beginning in 1840.\n\nWriting\nReynolds was a prolific writer of popular fiction starting from The Youthful Imposter, published in 1835 which was then republished later as The Parricide; or, The Youth's Career of Crime. After the publication of his first novel Reynolds then assumed the editorship of The Monthly Magazine, a position which he held between 1837 and 1838 and wrote articles under the pseudonym of \"Parisianus.\" Almost forgotten now, during his lifetime he was more read than Dickens or Thackeray; in his obituary, the trade magazine The Bookseller called Reynolds \"the most popular writer of our times\" (\"Obituary\" 600). His best-known work was the long-running serial The Mysteries of London (1844), which borrowed liberally in concept from Eug\u00e8ne Sue's Les Myst\u00e8res de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris). It sold 40,000 copies a week in penny instalments and more than a million copies cumulatively before it was issued in bound volumes, enjoying an international circulation in French, German, Italian, and Spanish translations. Although it was outlawed by the authorities, the German version achieved the status of a cult favourite on the Russian black market.\n\nThe Mysteries of London and its even lengthier sequel, The Mysteries of the Court of London, are considered to be among the seminal works of the Victorian \"urban mysteries\" genre, a style of sensational fiction which adapted elements of Gothic novels \u2013 with their haunted castles, innocent noble damsels in distress and nefarious villains \u2013 to produce stories which instead emphasized the poverty, crime, and violence of a great metropolis, complete with detailed and often sympathetic descriptions of the lives of lower-class lawbreakers and extensive glossaries of thieves' cant, all interwoven with a frank sexuality not usually found in popular fiction of the time.\n\nThe Mysteries of London, like most of Reynolds' works, was published first as a weekly penny dreadful, or \"Penny Blood\", illustrated with lurid engravings and circulating mainly among readers of limited means and education. Although Reynolds was unusual in his religious skepticism (one of the main characters in The Mysteries of London was a clergyman turned libertine) and political radicalism, his tales were intended for his mostly middle- and lower-class readers; they featured \"hump-backed dwarves, harridans and grave-robbers [who] groped past against a background of workhouses, jails, execution yards, thieves' kitchens and cemeteries. His readers could depend on him to bring in the theme of maiden virtue rudely strumpeted as often as possible.\"\n\nReynolds' Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was a gothic novel which described how the title character became a werewolf after making a pact with the devil. Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was republished in 1975 by Dover Books with an\nintroduction and bibliography of Reynolds by E. F. Bleiler.\n\nReynold's novels remained in print on both sides of the Atlantic longer than those of many of his contemporaries. An 1875 edition of Reynolds's Ciprina, published in Philadelphia, lists 40 novels including Mysteries of London under the heading \"George W. M. Reynolds' Great Works\", priced between 50 cents and $1.00. The Mysteries of the Court of London, translated into Marathi as well as Urdu, remained a best-seller in India well into the twentieth century. The Marathi translation was done by K.B. Mande in the early 20th century and was titled The Secret Deeds of the Elites of London. It was very popular in the Marathi-speaking area, as is evident by numerous references to the text in early 20th-century Marathi literature.\n\nChartism\nReynolds was also a major figure in the Chartist movement. In 1846, he founded two magazines, Reynolds' Miscellany (RM) and The London Journal (LJ). In 1849, he founded Reynolds's Political Instructor, which in May 1850 became Reynolds Weekly Newspaper, the leading radical newspaper of the post-Chartist era. It long survived him, ending publication in 1967 as the Sunday Citizen. Edwin Brett, a fellow chartist and publisher of penny dreadfuls, became a lifelong friend.\n\nFor both Reynolds's Political Instructor and Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, between 1849 and 1856, he would write a signed editorial every week in which he gave his opinion on the pressing political matters of the day.\n\nIn 1854, he relocated to Herne Bay in Kent, where he became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. Reynolds was an advocate of British Republicanism; much of his journalism, especially during the 1870s, \"promoted a levelling agenda against traditional social hierarchies and accentuated the difficulties of the British throne\".\n\nWorks\n\nNovels\nA prolific novelist, the list of Reynolds's works is long; matters are made more complex by the fact that American publishers often attributed the authorship of various anonymously written books to Reynolds as well. Furthermore, although he is known as a penny blood author, not all of his works appeared as serialised penny instalments.\n\nThe following works have, as a result of research by E. F. Bleiler, been confirmed to have been definitely authored by Reynolds:\n\n The Youthful Imposter\n (published in 3 vols by Librarie des Estrangers in 1835)\n The Baroness: A Novel \n (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1837, under the pseudonym of \"Parisianus\")\n Pickwick Abroad; or, The Tour in France \n (serialised in the Monthly Magazine between 1837 and 1838)\n Alfred de Rosann \n (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).\n The Father \n (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).\n Mary Hamel \n (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838).\n The Appointment: A Tale \n (serialised in The Isis in 1839).\n Grace Darling; or, the Heroine of the Ferne Islands \n (published in one volume by George Henderson in 1839).\n Robert Macaire in England\n (published in 3 vols by Thomas Tegg in 1839).\n Noctes Pickwickianae \n (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840).\n The Steam Packet: A Tale of the River and Ocean \n (published in one volume by Willoughby in 1840).\n The Drunkard's Tale \n (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840).\n Pickwick Married \n (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1841).\n Master Timothy's Bookcase \n (issued in weekly parts beginning 15 July 1841 and published as a single volume by W.

Reynolds was born in Auckland in 1915. He received his education at King's College, Auckland and then at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Australia. He graduated in 1937 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the New Zealand Army Service Corps. In 1939 he was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and trained as a pilot. He was posted to No. 3 Squadron RNZAF in 1940, which was then based at Wigram Aerodrome, near Christchurch. The squadron was equipped with the Short MUnless from the United Kingdom, and was being prepared for service as a maritime patrol unit in the Pacific. In September 1941, Reynolds was sent to England to attend the Royal Air Force's Staff College, at Andover, for a year. After graduating, he served in air intelligence at the Air Ministry, in London, for three years. He returned to New Zealand in January 1945, as the RNZAF's senior intelligence officer, based at its headquarters in Wellington. In 1950, Reynolds became the RNZAF's director of intelligence, based at Wigram. The following year he was appointed the service's chief of staff, and in this capacity he served as the New Zealand member of the British\u2013New Zealand\u2013United States military committee, which was responsible for the development of the hydrogen bomb. In 1954 he was posted to London as the RNZAF's air attach\u00e9 to the United Kingdom. The following year he was made a wing commander, and appointed to the directing staff of the Royal Air Force College of Air Warfare, at Manby, for three years. After a period as the RNZAF's director of operations, based at Wellington, in 1961 he was made an air commodore and appointed to the Air Force's command staff, in charge of the administration of all air force bases in New Zealand. In 1965, Reynolds became the RNZAF's vice-chief of staff, and two years later he was appointed chief of staff, in charge of the air force's 3,500 personnel. This made him the first New Zealander to hold this position. In this role he travelled widely, including to the United States, Britain, and Australia, to help form a common defence policy among the Commonwealth nations. He retired from the RNZAF in 1972, having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and was succeeded as chief of staff by Air Commodore David Crooks. After his retirement from the air force, Reynolds became the New Zealand director of the Bank of New Zealand.

The drama features Francis Lederer, Sigrid Gurie and J. Edward Bromberg.\n\nPlot\nJan Foley (Lederer), an amnesiac Czech pianist, is a victim of Nazi torture for playing a banned song. Living under a new identity on the island of French-governed Guadalupe, Jan tries to recall his past life while working for refugee smuggler Angelo (Alexander Granach).\n\nTo the melancholy island of Guadalupe come a band of refugees, stripped of their friends and their country by the war. Among them dwells a brooding, sinister man known only as \"El Hombre,\" whose memory was destroyed by the brutality of the Nazis. One evening, as El Hombre sits trance-like at the piano and plays a somber melody, his music drifts into the room inhabited by other refugees, Dr. Hoffman, his wife Anna, and their invalid charge, Marya Volny. El Hombre's playing reminds Anna of Jan Volny, a famous pianist from her homeland of Czechoslovakia, and she bitterly reflects upon the life that they lost.\n\nAfter finishing the piece, El Hombre reads a notice from the governor, warning refugees about \"murder boats\" that will promise them asylum in the U.S., but will leave them to perish at sea after fleecing them of their savings. The demented El Hombre takes the warning as a sign to destroy the fishing boat owned by his compassionate employer Angelo. El Hombre's act infuriates Angelo's cruel brothers, Luigi and Marco, who loathe the stranger and wish him dead.\n\nAs Marya's condition worsens, Anna blames herself for forcing the girl to leave her homeland and recalls the conditions that drove them into exile: After invading Prague, the Nazis grant permission to Czech pianist Jan Volny to present a concert. They stipulate, however, that \"The Moldau,\" a much-loved patriotic symphony written by Bedrich Smetana, be excluded from the concert. Carried away by the beauty of the music, Volny ends his concert with a four-minute paraphrase of the famed symphony. Realizing that his act will draw the wrath of the Nazis and that his wife, Marya, will also suffer at the hands of their oppressors, Volny arranges for the Hoffmans to smuggle her out of the country, but before he can escape himself, he is captured and subjected to unspeakable violence, which deranges him.\n\nEn route to a concentration camp, Volny overpowers his guards and escapes. After making his way to Lisbon, he hides on a fishing boat owned by Angelo and his brothers, which embarks shortly thereafter and carries him to the island of Guadalupe. In the fog of his unhinged brain, Volny fails to remember his own name and identity, and is thus dubbed El Hombre. As Anna's thoughts return to the present, Marya, enchanted by the sound of El Hombre's piano, rises from her bed, inches her way down the stairs and then collapses in the street. El Hombre finds her there, and as he fingers the crucifix encircling her neck, his memory begins to return.\n\nWhen the Hoffmans come looking for Marya, El Hombre retreats into the shadows. He begins to recall snatches of his life with Marya, but his reverie is cruelly interrupted by Luigi's harsh voice challenging him. Angelo hears shots and finds Luigi, gun in hand, standing over El Hombre's body. As the brothers argue, Luigi stabs Angelo with an ice pick. Noticing that El Hombre has vanished, the wounded Angelo follows a trail of blood up the stairs to Marya's room, where the Hoffmans are notifying the police of Marya's death. At her bedside, El Hombre cradles Marya's lifeless body in his arms, begging her to return to life. His entreaties echo the words spoken to him by Marya at the time of their separation in Czechoslovakia, affirming her certainty that he will one day come for her.\n\nCast\n Francis Lederer as Jan Volny\n Sigrid Gurie as Marya\n J.

It was Highsmith's second novel to be published in the UK under her own name, after The Price of Salt (1952), but her third to be published in the US, after The Longed-For Kiss (1955) and The Price of Salt (1956). Voice in the Wind is a murder mystery, and is Highsmith's most extensive exploration of the theme of dual personalities, which would become a major theme in her work. The book's title refers to the voice of conscience, which Highsmith herself described as \"the still, small voice\" of the title. The book's main character, Howard Ingham, is a writer who is struggling to complete a script for a film about a man with dual personalities. Ingham becomes convinced that the line between his own personality and that of his fictional character is beginning to blur, and that he may be responsible for a series of murders that have begun to occur around him. Voice in the Wind was adapted into a film of the same name in 1967, directed by Warren Beatty from a screenplay by Ben Maddow and starring Beatty, Julie Christie, and Goldie Hawn. The film was shot on location in Mexico, and featured a score by Carmelite monks. Voice in the Wind was published in the UK by Heinemann and in the US by G. P. Putnam's.

The main types of joints in the body include the following: 1. Fibrous joints 2. Cartilaginous joints 3. Synovial joints Fibrous joints Fibrous joints are joints in which the two bony surfaces are held together by fibrous tissue, also called connective tissue. They are also called synarthroses. Fibrous joints are very strong and do not allow for much movement. There are three types of fibrous joints: 1. Fibrous sutures 2. Fibrous ligaments 3. Fibrous capsules Fibrous sutures are present in the skull, where they hold the bones of the skull together. They are also found in the fingers and toes, where they join the phalanges to each other and to the metacarpal or metatarsal bones. Fibrous ligaments are flexible bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to each other, as well as to muscles, while fibrous capsules are flexible sleeves of fibrous tissue that surround the bones of the spine (the vertebrae) and the large leg bones (the femur and tibia). Cartilaginous joints Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the two bony surfaces are joined by cartilage, a flexible and lubricated connective tissue. They are also called synchondroses. Cartilaginous joints allow for more movement than fibrous joints, but less movement than synovial joints. There are three types of cartilaginous joints: 1. Cartilaginous sutures 2. Cartilaginous ligaments 3. Articular discs Cartilaginous sutures are found in the body's soft tissues, such as the larynx, the trachea, and the oral cavity. Cartilaginous ligaments are found in the axial skeleton, where they connect the bones of the spine (the vertebrae). Articular discs are found in the appendicular skeleton, where they connect the bones of the upper and lower limbs. Synovial joints Synovial joints are joints in which the two bony surfaces are joined by synovial fluid, a viscous fluid that is enclosed by a membrane called the synovial membrane. The synovial membrane is lubricated by the synovial fluid, which reduces friction between the bony surfaces of the joint. Synovial joints are the most flexible type of joint in the body. There are six types of synovial joints: 1. Ball and socket joints 2. Hinge joints 3. Pivot joints 4. Elbow joints 5. Wrist joints 6. Ginglymoid joints Ball and socket joints Ball and socket joints are found in the hip and shoulder joints, where the head of the humerus fits into the socket of the pelvis (the acetabulum). These joints allow for a wide range of movement, including forward and backward, side to side, and rotation. Hinge joints Hinge joints are found in the fingers and toes, as well as in the knees and elbows. They allow for flexion (bending) and extension (straightening), but do not allow for rotation. Pivot joints Pivot joints are found in the neck, where they connect the head to the torso, and in the tailbone, where they connect the spine to the pelvis. They allow for rotation, but do not allow for flexion or extension. Elbow joints Elbow joints are found in the upper arm, where they connect the humerus to the radius and the ulna. They allow for flexion and extension, as well as rotation. Wrist joints Wrist joints are found in the hand, where they connect the bones of the wrist to each other and to the bones of the fingers. They allow for flexion and extension, as well as rotation. Ginglymoid joints Ginglymoid joints are found in the jaw (the temporomandibular joint), where they connect the lower jaw to the skull. They allow for flexion and extension, as well as rotation.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40341140}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Demon Gaze\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "is a dungeon crawl video game developed by Kadokawa Games and Experience Inc. for the PlayStation Vita. Released in Japan on January 24, 2013, it was published in North America and Europe by NIS America in April 2014. The game takes place thousands of years after the events of its predecessor, Students of the Round, which was created by the same developer. \n\nIn Demon Gaze, the player controls Oz, a young man that possess the power of a magic eye capable of sealing demons. The gameplay is split between venturing into dungeons and spending time at the inn where players can build relationships with non-player characters or spend the money they have earned in the dungeons. A manga adaptation for Demon Gaze illustrated by Kurono began serialisation in Dengeki Maoh in December 2013. An international version of the game was released in Japan as Demon Gaze: Global Edition on July 3, 2014. An enhanced version of the game titled Demon Gaze EXTRA was released in September 2021 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in Japan with a western release set for January 2022.\n\nGameplay\nThe game takes place thousands of years after the events in Students of the Round. Players assume the role of the protagonist Oz, a mysterious young man with the power of a magic eye that grants him the ability to seal demons. The game allows players to create secondary characters that join him on his quest, with seven character classes and five different character races. There are 45 character illustrations altogether, which may be changed by \"taking a bath\". The demons in the game are part machine, and some of them can transform when they go on a rampage. After demons are defeated, the player is able to summon them to battle.\n\nOz journeys into the dungeons of Mislid to kill the demons and gather treasure before returning to town with his loot. Loot can then be used to pay rent at the local Dragon Princess inn or it can be spent to improve the player's party. Although battles take part in dungeons, the game's hub is set in a town where the player can rest and strengthen their party. While at the inn, players can rest or converse with the other non-player characters at the inn, including the manager Fran Pendor, who has a secret mission to offer the player. Certain conversations with non-player characters result in \"heart pounding\" cutscenes. Throughout the game, it is also possible to change the difficulty level, either in certain Dungeon Rooms or by talking with particular characters.\n\nSetting\nDemon Gaze is set in The World of Mythrid, which is divided into 6 regions: the castle of Grimodal, the Old City (Red and Blue), the Slave Graveyard, the Curtain of Star Trees and the Dragon Princess Inn.\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was released in Japan on January 24, 2013. Some of the monsters and items from the prequel, Students of the Round, are included in Demon Gaze, but the game features new dungeons and new half-machine demons as well. The game features many prominent Japanese voice actors including Saori Hayami, Atsuko Tanaka, and Yukari Tamura.\n\nSequel\nDevelopment of a sequel title began in mid-2014.  Demon Gaze II was released in Japan September 29, 2016. A Western release has been announced for, and released in fall 2017 on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4.\n\nReception\n\nDemon Gaze currently holds a score of 70.66% at GameRankings, and 70/100 at Metacritic. Four Famitsu reviewers scored Demon Gaze 9, 9, 8 and 8 out of 10, for a total score of 34/40. The game sold 25,316 physical retail copies within the first week of release in Japan, and retail sales reached 47,993 by mid-February 2013. The game ranked as the sixth most purchased digital Vita game on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2013. By April 2014, it was announced by Kadokawa Games that Demon Gaze shipped 180,000 copies worldwide, including both physical and download copies. A July 2014 announcement by Kadokawa later confirmed a global shipment figure of 200,000 copies.\n\nDale North of Destructoid also gave the game 7/10, claiming Demon Gaze to be \"a solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\" Brittany Vincent of GamesRadar rewarded the game three stars out of five, summarising the game up as \"colorful, brash, and spunky, but it's little more than a wonky journey through dungeon after forgettable dungeon. If it's a grind you're looking for, you can do far better than the mediocrity of becoming a Demon Gazer.\" Heidi Kemps of GameSpot scored the game 7/10, finding the battles, dungeons and characters to be enjoyable, though the story, visual style and the heavy amount of fan service was criticised. Josiah Renaudin of IGN rated the game a 7.2/10, praising the combat and characters, but criticising the uninspired visuals and \"cookie-cutter premise.\" \n\nMarcus Estrada of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it \"a very mechanically sound dungeon crawler,\" and that \"the biggest hurdle to enjoying the game is simply your tastes for (or tolerance of) copious displays of fan service.\" Jim Sterling of The Escapist gave Demon Gaze a more positive review, as well as recommending the game, stating \"this is easily one of the more addictive ones I've enjoyed for a while, and it's perfect on Vita\", and scoring it 4.5/5. Nevertheless, Matt Kamen of The Guardian rated Demon Gaze much lower, giving the game only 2 stars out of 5, as \"Demon Gaze does make nice use of the Vita's online functions, allowing for notes left between players advising of secrets or dangers, but it's not enough to make up for a resoundingly lacklustre package.\"\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Official Japanese website, Archived on December 10, 2012\n Official North American website\n\n2013 video games\nNintendo Switch games\nPlayStation 4 games\nPlayStation Vita games\nKadokawa Shoten games\nKadokawa Dwango franchises\nVideo games developed in Japan\nRole-playing video games\nFantasy video games\nVideo games about demons\nFirst-person party-based dungeon crawler video games", "machine_text": " Demon Gaze Demon Gaze is a Japanese visual novel developed by Japanese company Crea-Tech. The game was first released for PC as a first press bonus for purchasers of Compile Heart's PlayStation 2 game Saekano: bazooka shot. A port for the PlayStation 3 was released in Japan on December 18, 2008, via download from the PlayStation Store. The story takes place in the near future, and is set in a Japanese city that has been taken over by demons. The protagonist is a young man whose name and gender can be chosen by the player. The protagonist is an ordinary citizen who is caught up in the demon attack and, after managing to survive, is subsequently turned into a demon himself. The plot follows the protagonist as he tries to live a normal life despite his new circumstances. The game is divided into two main storylines. The first is the \"Past\" route, which follows the main character before he was turned into a demon, and the \"Present\" route, which follows the character after he becomes a demon. The game also features a \"Human\" and \"Demon\" route, which the player can choose between at certain points in the game. In the \"Human\" route, the main character tries to live a normal life as a human, despite being a demon. In the \"Demon\" route, the character embraces his demon nature and becomes a powerful being, but is shunned by other demons. The game also features a \"Rebellion\" route, in which the main character rebels against the demon world and tries to take back the city. Throughout the game, the player can choose between different dialogue options, which will affect the outcome of the story. There are also various minigames that can be played, such as a card game, a dice game, and a puzzle game. The game's graphics are in 2D, and the game is voiced by a cast of Japanese actors and actresses. The game's music was composed by Tomohiro Sato. Demon Gaze received a mixed reception. Some critics praised the game's concept and story, while others criticized the game's short length and lack of replay value.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 37847007}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dongas road protest group\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Dongas Tribe was a collection of road protesters and travellers in England, noted for their occupation of Twyford Down outside Winchester, Hampshire. The name Dongas comes from the Matabele word for \"gully\", given by Winchester locals to the deep drovers' tracks on Twyford Down.\n\nJohn Vidal, writing in The Guardian in 2012, said of The Dongas that \"the 15-20 urban youths who camped out to try to defend Twyford Down in 1992 are recognised to have fired up British environmental protest and kickstarted a major shift in green attitudes in both government and the public.\"\n\nHistory\n\nThe Twyford Down protest was a protest against the M3 motorway extension which destroyed some rich ecological sites, one of the very few habitats of the Chalkhill Blue butterfly and six species of rare orchid, and ancient monuments there (SSSI and Scheduled Ancient Monument). The Conservative government was planning to construct a new roadway through the area in order to save three minutes of transit time between London and Southampton.\n\nFollowing \"Yellow Wednesday\", when hordes of police and security guards invaded the camp to bulldoze the area, the Dongas Tribe left Twyford Down for Bramdean Common.  Earth First!, who had been heavily involved in the setting up and support of the camp and actions, continued the protests and restarted a camp in Plague Pits Valley.\n\nThey constituted about twenty people. Of them, seven were sent to prison in 1993 for breaking an injunction. In one incident, around fifty protesters chained themselves to a bridge, leading to the arrest of some. At least one protester (Paul Kingsnorth) subsequently sued the police and received a $5000 settlement.\n\nSome of the 'original Dongas' (as they became called) of the mid 1990s were musicians who made a living by busking, sometimes using traditional music from Brittany.\n\nThe first child born in the Dongas tribe, to Rosie Lambert, was named May Brigit \"Donga\" Lambert and was born on 1 May 1994, Beltane and May Day.\n\nIn late 2012, original members of the Dongas, as well as hundreds of others, returned to the hillside on the protest's 20th anniversary. They expressed warnings about the government's more than forty new road plans.\n\nInfluence \nThe Dongas road protests inspired a major change in green attitudes among both the public and the government, radicalizing a generation of British youth. Among them, Paul Kingsnorth of The Dark Mountain Project credits his arrest at Twyford Down as his impetus for engaging in further protests.\n\nSee also\nDirect Action\nRebecca Lush\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Alun Howkins (2002), \"From Diggers to Dongas: the Land in English Radicalism, 1649\u20132000.\" History Workshop Journal 54(1), pp. 1\u201323.\n\nExternal links\nDongas Tribe musical field recordings\n\"Call for Donga for Rath Lugh\"\n\nAnti-road protest\nDIY culture\nSquatters' movements", "machine_text": " Dongas road protest group The Dongas road protest group was a South African opposition political movement that existed from 1984 to 1989, notable for its radical opposition to, and successful resistance against, the apartheid government's Programme of Action. The name \"Dongas\" was a playful spoonerism on the word \"d\u0e07os\", meaning \"idiots\" in Portuguese, and was first used as the name of an anti-apartheid street committee in the Western Cape. The first dongas protest march took place on 30 March 1984 in Athlone, Cape Town. The organisation was launched in August 1984 at an underground conference attended by over 30 delegates from various anti-apartheid groups. The conference was held in a flat in Johannesburg, and was organised by the Vaal Civic Association. At the conference, the constitution of the organisation was drafted. The constitution called for the organisation to have a \"non-racial and non-sexist\" membership, and to work towards the creation of a \"non-racial and non-sexist society\". The Dongas movement was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Africanists, a group of African National Congress (ANC) members who had broken away from the ANC in the early 1970s, and who believed that the ANC should focus on the liberation of black Africans, rather than all people of colour. The Dongas movement therefore drew many members from the ANC, and from organisations that had been formed by the ANC's internal opponents, such as the Black People's Convention (BPC), the South African Students' Organization (SASO), and the Black Workers' Project (BWP). The Dongas movement was also influenced by the ideas of the PAC's Amandla Cultural Group, which had been formed by PAC members who were critical of the PAC's leadership. The Dongas movement was opposed to the idea of a negotiated settlement with the apartheid government, and instead called for a revolutionary struggle, in which the black working class would lead the way. The Dongas movement was also critical of the ANC's policy of non-racialism, and called for a revolutionary movement that was exclusively black. The movement's constitution stated that \"the national democratic revolution can only succeed if it is a revolution of the majority, the black working class, and not a revolution of all the people of South Africa\". The Dongas movement was active in a number of anti-apartheid campaigns, including the Black Wednesday campaign, in which the apartheid government's introduction of the Tricameral Parliament was opposed, and the \"Gatvol\" campaign, in which the government's attempt to force coloured people to carry Passes was opposed. The Dongas movement also participated in a number of protest marches, including the 1984 march in Athlone, the 1985 march in Soweto, and the 1989 march in Cape Town. The Dongas movement was active in the Vaal Triangle, Johannesburg, and the Western Cape, and had a number of prominent members, including Steve Biko, the leader of the South African Students' Organization (SASO), and the PAC's Amandla Cultural Group. The movement also had a number of prominent white members, including the PAC's Amandla Cultural Group, and the Black Workers' Project (BWP). The Dongas movement was banned in 1989, and a number of its members were arrested. The movement's leaders, however, continued to operate underground, and the movement was able to maintain a presence in the Vaal Triangle, Johannesburg, and the Western Cape. The Dongas movement was one of the most influential anti-apartheid movements in South Africa, and its radical opposition to the apartheid government's Programme of Action, and its successful resistance against the programme, helped to bring about the end of apartheid.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 277934}

The Roman mint was one of the most productive in the world, and the entire empire was covered by a network of mints. There were about 150 mints in the Roman world, and it is estimated that there were more than 30 in Rome alone. The first mint in Rome was established in 269 BC by the first Roman consul, Appius Claudius Crassus. This mint was located in the Temple of Janus in the Forum Boarium. The coins were made of bronze, and the design featured a janiform head, a head of Janus on the obverse and a head of the goddess Roma on the reverse. The word \"ROMANUS\" was engraved on the coins, and the design remained unchanged for many years. In the 2nd century BC, the mint was moved to the Temple of Honor and Virtue, and the coins were made of purer bronze. The design was changed to feature a head of Janus on the obverse and a head of the goddess Roma on the reverse, with the word \"ROMANUS\" engraved on the coins. In the 1st century BC, the mint was moved to the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and the coins were made of even purer bronze. The design was changed to feature a head of Janus on the obverse and a head of the goddess Roma on the reverse, with the word \"ROMANUS\" engraved on the coins.

He moved to the United States at age 16 and later played college basketball for the University of Central Florida (UCF). Fall went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, but later signed with the Boston Celtics. During his two seasons in Boston, he became a fan favorite. Fall signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent in 2021.\n\nFall is the tallest current NBA player and is one of the tallest living humans. His measurements at the 2019 NBA Draft Combine set all-time NBA records for tallest height in shoes (), longest wingspan (), and highest standing reach (). The NBA now lists players' heights without shoes, so Fall is listed at .\n\nEarly life\nFall was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal. In 2011, Senegalese basketball coach Ibrahima N'Diaye, the brother of former NBA player Mamadou N'Diaye, heard from a friend about an exceptionally tall teenager he had seen  playing with friends in a local street.  After identifying him, they visited the 15-year-old Fall\u2014who already stood  tall\u2014at his home and persuaded Fall's mother, Marianne Diop Sene, to allow Fall to start attending N'Diaye's basketball academy. Fall moved to the United States at age 16.  He first played organized basketball in Houston, Texas, and trained with NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nHe was listed as  and was purportedly still growing around his senior year, making him the tallest high school basketball player in the country while he played for Jamie's House Charter and Liberty Christian Prep. \n\nDue to his height and reach, Fall was one of the most highly scouted high school basketball centers in the nation. Fall first played for Jamie's House Charter School in Houston, where his team won the state championship. Fall played with ISTI all-stars summer travel team & for Each 1 Teach 1 on the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) circuit where he played alongside fellow class of 2015 recruits Antonio Blakeney and Ben Simmons.

As a senior in 2015, Fall averaged 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks per game. With nearly forty different schools expressing interest in him, Fall committed to the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who officially signed him on October 28, 2014. He played with the UCF Knights under head coach Donnie Jones.\n\nCollege career\n\nFall played college basketball for the UCF Knights as a center. He faced fellow giant Senegalese center Mamadou N'Diaye (unrelated to the former NBA player of the same name), who stands at , in the tallest tip-off and match-up in U.S. college basketball history in a game against UC Irvine. Both men come from the same city, Dakar. By his sophomore year, Fall became the tallest player in college basketball after N'Diaye declared for the 2016 NBA draft. During his sophomore season, Fall would make considerable improvements in his playing style. In 2017, Fall was named American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. Fall grew to be an efficient player, ranking second nationally in field goal percentage as of January 2017. On 5 April 2017, Fall declared for the 2017 NBA draft, with the possibility of returning to Central Florida still available to him before the end of the draft lottery that year. On 24 May 2017, Fall withdrew his name from consideration for the NBA draft, to return to UCF for his junior year. During his junior year, Fall injured his shoulder, causing him to only play in 16 games, totaling 351 minutes. Coming into his senior season, Fall was named to the Preseason Second Team All-AAC. During his senior season, Fall helped lead the Knights to the NCAA Tournament and secured their first victory in program history with a win over VCU. In his final game, Fall recorded 15 points and six rebounds in a losing effort against Duke 77\u201376.\n\nProfessional career\nAfter the conclusion of his senior year, Fall was named one of 80 participants (40 representing the NBA draft hopefuls) for the NBA G League Elite Camp on May 12\u201314. By the end of the event, Fall later got transferred into the NBA Draft Combine as one of an additional 11 participants there.

Today the garden houses about 2,000 species of plants, typically Mediterranean and European, though there are also examples from South America and the Orient. The garden also has a large collection of cryptogams, and in particular ferns. The garden's intent is to serve as a center for the study of the vegetable kingdom, in particular of the Italian flora. There is also a herbarium, with about 1.2 million samples. In the early 20th century, the garden's director, the Italian botanist Giorgio Parisi (born 1936), discovered a large number of plant species new to science.

It is held annually in Dubai in late November and attracts in excess of 67,000 construction professionals (audited by BPA Worldwide). \n\nThe Big 5 runs alongside six specialised events enabling industry professionals to source products for every stage of the construction projects: The Big 5 Heavy, Middle East Concrete, HVAC R Expo, Middle East Stone, The Big 5 Solar, and the Urban Design & Landscape Expo.\n\nHistory \nThe Big 5 has its origins in an event known as Arab Water and came about from an amalgamation of five separate product-focused events that all had a link to the construction sector - such as HVAC and building materials.\nWith the building of the Dubai World Trade Centre, which began to develop in the late 1970s, the event found a permanent home and has expanded in size along with the venue. When dmg events acquired the exhibition in 2000, the event covered some 12,000m\u00b2: this has risen to over 100,000m\u00b2 in gross floor space. \n\nGovernment support for the event has come from both international and local institutions. In 2007, the event was one of the first in the region to welcome a prime minister when the then Italian leader Romano Prodi visited the exhibition with his minister for international trade. In 2012, British prime minister David Cameron also visited the event in support of his nation\u2019s export businesses. The visits reflected both the value of bilateral trade with the UAE but also the rise in importance of the Persian Gulf region as a whole to European export manufacturers.\n\nEducational events and special features \n\nSince 2010 there has been an increasing emphasis on education within the events - in the form of conferences, seminars and workshops - to support continued professional development among audiences. The educational programmes are presented by a wide selection of the industry\u2019s architects, consultants, contractors and sub-contractors who volunteer their time and expertise to further the development of the construction sector. These free education components also include certification, overseen by the UK-based CPD Certification Service, so attendance can contribute to a person\u2019s membership standing in organisations such as RICS or the CIOB.\n\nIn 2018, The Big 5 launched the Women in Construction Forum & Awards initiative, aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace in the construction industry. Also worth mentioning is the Start-up City feature dedicated to startups with a viable product for the construction industry.\n\nReferences \n\nTrade fairs in Dubai", "machine_text": " The Big Five The Big Five is a model of personality traits developed by psychologists Paul T. Costa and Robert R. McCrae from the 1980s, as an extension of the two-factor model of personality. The five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. It is sometimes referred to as the five-factor model (FFM). There are two versions of the Big Five model. The original version, known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM), includes a sixth factor, known as H Factor, orHonesty/Humility. This factor is used to assess the level of positive and negative affectivity, and is sometimes referred to as the \"happy-go-lucky\" or \"pessimistic\" factor. However, researchers decided to drop it from the model, because it was not strongly correlated with the other five factors, and because it was not consistently used in research. The Big Five factors are often referred to by the mnemonic OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Openness to experience Openness to experience is a dimension of personality that refers to a general tendency to be imaginative, creative, and open to new ideas. It is often called \"openness to change\" or \"openness to novelty\". Openness to experience is characterized by flexible cognition, which is a tendency to think about problems and concepts in new ways. This cognitive style is also related to creative thinking and problem solving. Conscientiousness Conscientiousness is a dimension of personality that refers to a general tendency to be organized, dependable, and self-controlled. Conscientious people are typically hardworking and reliable, and they tend to achieve success in school and work. They are also more likely to be healthy and to engage in healthy behaviors, such as regular exercise and healthy eating. Extraversion Extraversion is a dimension of personality that refers to a general tendency to be outgoing, sociable, and energetic. Extraverts are typically very talkative and assertive, and they tend to be very sociable. They are also more likely to be optimistic and to experience positive emotions. Agreeableness Agreeableness is a dimension of personality that refers to a general tendency to be friendly, compassionate, and cooperative. Agreeable people are typically very friendly and helpful, and they tend to be very well-liked. They are also more likely to be trustworthy and to have good relationships. Neuroticism Neuroticism is a dimension of personality that refers to a general tendency to be anxious, depressed, and emotionally unstable. Neurotic people are typically very emotional and reactive, and they tend to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression.

In the following year, the Project Mooncircle was presented at the Second German Interplanetary Conference. The project consisted of two earth return vehicles (ERT) and one surface lander. The ERTs were to be launched separately and would meet at the Moon. The lander would be launched with one of the ERTs. In 1967, the Third German Interplanetary Conference was held in Munich. At this conference, the Project Mooncircle was presented with a new lander design. The lander would be launched on a low-power rocket and would carry only two astronauts. The Project Mooncircle was never realized due to a lack of funding and technical difficulties.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chris Greetham\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Christopher Herbert Millington Greetham (28 August 1936 \u2013 13 March 2017) played first-class cricket for Somerset from 1957 to 1966 as a middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler.  Greetham was a tall, fair-haired right-handed batsman usually used in Somerset's late middle order and a right-arm seam bowler who, for a couple of seasons in the early 1960s, took enough wickets to be classed as an all-rounder. He was considered a good cover fielder, with a strong and accurate throw.\n\nCareer\nHe first played for Somerset in 1957 and became a regular player in 1959, when he hit 881 runs in the season and made his highest first-class score, an unbeaten 151 in the match against the Combined Services. One week after this innings, he made a second century, 104, including three sixes and 12 fours, against somewhat more demanding opposition in the match against Derbyshire. The innings, said Wisden, \"revealed he could be relied upon when quick scoring was needed\".\n\nThe following two seasons, 1960 and 1961, saw Greetham make useful innings and take useful wickets, but he did not advance on his 1959 figures, making around 800 runs in each season and failing to score a century in either. In 1962, however, he made 1,000 runs for the first time in a season, finishing with 1151 at an average of 26.76 runs per innings, and taking 69 first-class wickets at an average of 20.91. There were no centuries in this season, but his seven for 56 against Glamorgan were the best innings bowling figures of his career, and when he took six for 19 and four for 29 against Lancashire late in the season he achieved 10 wickets in a match for the only time in his first-class career. Wisden was complimentary about Greetham's progress in 1962: \"Greetham, previously a useful middle order batsman, developed into an extremely competent all-rounder,\" it wrote. \"A naturally aggressive right-hander, he scored over 1,000 runs for the first time and, bowling at a lively pace, took more wickets during the season than in his previous four years with the county.\" Greetham was awarded his county cap in 1962.\n\nThe 1963 season saw Somerset finish third in the County Championship, equalling the highest placing in its history to that point. Greetham was one of six players to pass 1,000 runs for the season, and his final aggregate of 1186 was his best for a single season, with the average of 28.23 runs per innings the highest of his career. Against Leicestershire at Weston-super-Mare, on a wet pitch, he made 141 in three hours; eight Somerset wickets had fallen for 145 when Greetham was joined by Harold Stephenson, the Somerset captain, and the pair put on 183 for the ninth wicket in 105 minutes. The stand remains the ninth wicket record for Somerset: it was equalled, but not surpassed, in 1990 by Chris Tavare and Neil Mallender. With the recruitment of fast bowler Fred Rumsey to Somerset in 1963, there was less bowling for Greetham, but he still took 44 wickets.\n\nGreetham was one of several Somerset batsmen for whom the 1964 season saw a regression. Unlike Peter Wight and Brian Roe, who suffered similar declines, he retained his place for most matches, but his aggregate of runs dropped by more than half to just 504, there was only one score of more than 50, and his average fell too to just 15. His bowling offered no consolation, and his wickets fell to just 17 and the average rose to more than 40 runs per wicket.\n\nThere was a small improvement in batting in 1965, when he made 943 runs in all matches at an average of 21.93. The total included centuries in both the home and away matches against Middlesex. Wisden commented in its reports on both matches about the speed of Greetham's scoring and the power of his strokes, and later in the season noted \"a remarkable innings\" against Cambridge University in which Greetham, arriving at the wicket with 45 minutes of the first day to play, reached 73 not out by close of play (he went on to 93). But Greetham's bowling had disappeared almost entirely by this stage: in 28 County Championship matches in 1965, he bowled only six overs and took no wickets, and his only two wickets of the whole season came in the match against Cambridge University.\n\nThe 1966 season was, like 1963, a successful one for Somerset, but this time Greetham played almost no part. Dropped after two matches in which he made only 26 runs, he did not regain his place except for one match against Cambridge University, in which he again took two wickets, but again failed with the bat. This was his last first-class match.\n\nGreetham \"would have been made for one-day cricket\", says one modern directory of Somerset cricketers. In fact, his record in the 10 Gillette Cup matches he played for Somerset between 1963 and 1966 was modest, with 150 runs in 10 innings and just three wickets. He did, however, retain his place in Somerset's one-day side longer than in the first-class team: his last first-team appearance was in the Gillette semi-final defeat by Warwickshire in August 1966.\n\nThis was not, however, his final List A appearance. Having left Somerset at the end of the 1966 season, he appeared in Minor Counties cricket for Devon in 1968 and 1969, and in the latter season he played in the first round Gillette Cup match against Hertfordshire, not bowling but scoring 32 out of a Devon total of 75 as Hertfordshire won the match easily.\n\nAfter cricket\nGreetham played three non-first-class matches for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Free Foresters in 1970 and 1971 with some success. Outside cricket, he worked as \"a diamond sorter, teacher and film extra\". He was also secretary of a golf club in Devon.\n\nReferences\n\n1936 births\n2017 deaths\nEnglish cricketers\nSomerset cricketers\nDevon cricketers", "machine_text": " Chris Greetham (born 4 May 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nordegg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nordegg is a hamlet in west-central Alberta, Canada within Clearwater County. It is located in the North Saskatchewan River valley in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, just east of the intersection of the David Thompson Highway and the Highway 734 spur of the Bighorn Highway (the Forestry Trunk Road). A former coal mining town, it was named after Martin Nordegg and the name probably means \"North Corner\" in a German dialect. The railway station name at the locality was called Brazeau rather than Nordegg at certain points in its history, but the local post office has always been named Nordegg. The name Brazeau is now obsolete.\n\nHistory \nIn 1907, Martin Cohn (who later changed his surname to Nordegg) of the German Development Company, working with D.B. Dowling of the Geological Survey of Canada, staked claims covering coal deposits near the South Brazeau (now Blackstone), Bighorn, and North Saskatchewan rivers. At Nordegg's urging, Brazeau Collieries Ltd. was founded to exploit them, and the Canadian Northern Railway (which later became part of the Canadian National Railway) agreed to build a rail line to the northern part of the area. This led to the founding of the coal-mining town of Nordegg.\n\nA small camp was established at the future townsite in 1911, coal production began in earnest in 1912, and the rail line, known as the Brazeau Branch, arrived at the town in 1913. Prior to that time, the Nordegg area was accessible only by horse. In 1914, the town was founded as one of the first planned communities in Alberta and it was named in honor of Martin Nordegg's efforts by railway entrepreneur William Mackenzie.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, German assets in Canada were frozen. Martin Nordegg was permitted to remain at the town and supervise operations, but in the summer of 1915 he was asked to leave Canada. He was allowed to return in 1921, but he had lost his position with the mine.\n\nThe coal at Nordegg is part of the Gates Formation of the Luscar Group. Of the five coal seams at Nordegg, two were mined: the No. 2 and No. 3 Seams, which averaged  and  thick, respectively. They were separated by about  of rock. They dipped at an angle of 12\u00b0 and were worked by underground room and pillar methods. Production peaked at  in 1923, and the labor force at that time was about 800. Five small briquetting plants were added to the operation in 1937 to produce a marketable product from powdery, fine coal.\n\nOn 31 October 1941, a large underground explosion in the No. 3 Mine killed 29 miners. Mining resumed six weeks later, and during 1942 the Nordegg mine was one of the top coal-producing mines in Alberta. The town reached a maximum population of about 2,500 in the early 1940s, and a surface mining operation was added in 1946.\n\nIn 1950, a fire destroyed the tipple and five wooden briquetting plants. A new, more modern briquetting plant was then built of metal. It began operation at the end of 1951 but a large government debt had been incurred for its construction. Coal markets declined, primarily due to the decreasing use of steam coal as railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesel, and Brazeau Collieries closed permanently in 1955. Most people left after the mine closed, although a few families stayed on.\n\nThe coal reserves at Nordegg had not been exhausted, but mining never resumed. Total production had been about 9.6 million tonnes of low- to medium-volatile bituminous coal.\n\nClimate \nNordegg has a subarctic climate (Dfc) which can be considered a subalpine climate due to its altitude with locations on the same latitude having warmer climates. Summers are mild, with a few warm days sprinkled in here and there, while winters are cold and snowy.\n\nDemographics \n\nNordegg recorded a population of 53 in the 1986 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada.\n\nAttractions \nMost of the surface coal handling, processing and support facilities at Nordegg are still standing. They were declared a Provincial Historic Resource in 1992, and a National Historic Site of Canada in 2002. There are guided tours of the surface facilities during the summer months. Tours of the underground mine workings are not possible because most of the tunnels have collapsed. A stretch of about  into the entrances of the No. 2 and No. 3 Mines has been restored and can be entered, but beyond that the entries are blocked.\n\nA land exchange with the Province of Alberta has stimulated redevelopment of Nordegg. A mountain acreage community, the North Nordegg Subdivision, is developing north of Highway 11, adjacent to the Shunda Creek Hostel. Clearwater County has released plans for the redevelopment of downtown Nordegg, much of it on the footprint of the original townsite.\n\nSee also \nList of communities in Alberta\nList of hamlets in Alberta\n\nReferences \n\n When Coal Was King: The Brazeau Collieries Operation at Nordegg, Alberta.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jemaah Tarbiyah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jemaah Tarbiyah, also known as the Tarbiyah movement or the Dakwah movement, is an Islamic religious movement based in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah was an active movement during the 1980s to 1990s and consisted of university students, aimed at the religious education and da'wah (proselytizing). The movement is considered to be influenced by the teaching of Muslim Brotherhood. It is considered an important influence for Islamization of Indonesia. The movement became the bedrock of the Islamist party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) which was founded in 2002.\n\nEtymology\nThe term tarbiyah () means \"intensive Islamic education\" or \"disciplining\" in Arabic. Initially, the term was mainly used by outsiders to designate the particular phenomenon and activities conducted by certain groups. There has been no formal consensus on the naming by the activists of the movement. Tarbiyah is often used by Indonesian Islamic higher educational institutions as a name of faculties specialized in religious education. The term was also used by a socio-religious organization Union of Islamic Education (Persatuan Tarbiyah Islam, PERTI) established in 1928. The usage of tarbiyah in the context of Jemaah Tarbiyah has no direct relations with any of the latter.\n\nHistory\nThere had been a history of da'wah based on university campuses, notably of elite secular universities such as Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) since the 1970s. However, there was a demand for more comprehensive and systematic methods of da'wah, which was still very informal and strictly monitored by the Suharto regime. Some religious gatherings based in Salman Mosque of ITB is considered one of many origins of Jemaah Tarbiyah. These religious gatherings put particular emphasis on specific attitudes toward basic Islamic teachings and interpretations, including the principle of ukhuwah (brotherhood), dress code, and the prohibition on smoking.\n\nAmong the activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah, four Muslim students returned from the Islamic University of Madinah, Hilmi Aminuddin, Salim Segaf Aljufri, Abdullah Said Baharmus, and Acep Abdul Syukur, are considered founding fathers (collectively called muassis). Facing demands of more systematic proselytization and religious education, these four students and their cohorts have articulated a comprehensive program and organized activities, improved with methodology from the Middle East which was often named as usrah system. Its religious gatherings were known as halaqah which involved mentoring and Qur'anic recitations. Since early to mid-1980s, the activity had quickly spread across elite secular universities, where religious education was required to be complemented.\n\nJemaah Tarbiyah has often been pointed out of its Muslim Brotherhood influence. Usrah system was a training program of Muslim Brotherhood members, and the Tarbiyah movement had directly implemented the methodology. Activists of the Tarbiyah movement are also considered to be committed toward translation of books written by members of Muslim Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb. There is also an explanation that links Jemaah Tarbiyah to the Indonesian Islamic Dawaah Council (DDII), a conservative Islamic organization headed by Mohammad Natsir. DDII had contributed to the constructions of mosques in the universities and was central to the importation of religious teachings from the Middle East. Some of the prominent activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah had DDII backgrounds.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Jemaah Tarbiyah had managed to grow its influence underground, mostly due to its focus on religious issues and avoided political activism. The movement had also established formal institutions with similar aims but without explicit reference toward its connections. Such institutions include foundations like Nurul Fikri, Al-Hikmah Boarding School, and PA-HAM. In the 1990s, the movement had established influence over many intra-university student organizations and discussion forums. The movement accommodated various Islamic religious strands from traditionalist to modernists, and was fluid regarding pragmatic concerns such as political system.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the democratic transition, activists of the movement founded an Islamist political party Justice Party (PK) in 1998, and its successor Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in 2002. Majority of the members of PK and PKS, including the first president of PK Nurmahmudi Ismail, were activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah. The establishment of a political party was chosen over the establishment of a formal socio-religious organization. The decision was supported by the majority of the activists. Main activities related to da'wah conducted during the Jemaah Tarbiyah era were succeeded by the political parties. Today, activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah have been continuously influencing the creation of new trends in da'wah and Islamic socio-religious movements, including One Day One Juz (ODOJ).\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\nDamanik, A.S.

He was born Scott Thomas Burns in Brooklyn New York, on Halloween, October 31, 1962.\n\nImmediately after his birth, he was moved to the Angel Guardian Home in Brooklyn, New York, where he was put up for adoption. A few months later he was adopted by Frances Ann McCambridge and Gerard Alexander McCambridge Sr.. After the adoption was final, they changed his name to Gerard Alexander McCambridge Jr..\n\nFrom the age of 9 years old, Gerard was fascinated by magic.  He started to study the art as a hobby. Gerard performed his first magic show at a neighbors birthday party for money at the age of 12. He was billing himself as \"Gerard the Great.\" He started apprenticing for professional magicians and touring the country as an on stage assistant at the age of 15. By the time he was 18, he had a full show of his own. It is then he changed his performing name to Gerry McCambridge. Years later he took his love for magic, and mixed it with the observational skills he learned from his father who was a NYC detective and an expert at interrogation, and added a few mentalism routines to his magic show. In 1988 he stopped performing magic completely and focused solely on performing as a mentalist.\n\nHe has studied memory techniques, body language interpretation, stage hypnosis, linguistics, statistics, law of averages, non-verbal communication, acting, theatre and stand up comedy, to enhance his mentalism show. In the 1980s Gerry was headlining as \u201cGerry McCambridge-The Mentalist\u201d in Comedy Clubs across the country.    Gerry also appeared on countless radio and TV talk shows. In 2002 Gerry dropped his name and billed himself as \u201cThe Mentalist.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, the International Magicians Society presented Gerry with the \u201cMerlin Award\u201d for \u201cMentalist of the Decade\u201d.  Gerry was the first mentalist in history to receive the Merlin award for mentalism since the organizations inception in 1968.\n\nIn 2002 Gerry wrote his first TV script titled \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d and took it out to Los Angeles to pitch it to the major networks.  Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC witnessed Gerry\u2019s live performances many times, and instantly licensed the special for his network.  Gerry became the creator, executive producer and star of the hit prime-time network television special \"The Mentalist\u201d which started airing to 6.2 million viewers in the United States on May 12, 2004. The show then aired in Canada, South Africa, Korea, The Middle East, New Zealand, India, Thailand, Australia, Denmark, The Netherlands, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004 the Psychic Entertainers Association, an international organization of his peers, awarded Gerry for his \u201cOutstanding Contributions to the Art of Mentalism.\u201d\n\nAlso in the summer of 2004 Gerry performed his one man show \u201cThe Mentalist\u201d to critical acclaim Off-Broadway in New York City and made his acting debut in the movie \"Mattie Fresno and the Holofulx Universe.\"\n\nIn 2005 the Psychic Entertainers Association again awarded Gerry.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Villanovan culture\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Villanovan culture (c. 900\u2013700 BC), regarded as the earliest phase of the Etruscan civilization, was the earliest Iron Age culture of Italy. It directly followed the Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture which branched off from the Urnfield culture of Central Europe. The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality of Castenaso in the Metropolitan City of Bologna where, between 1853 and 1855, Giovanni Gozzadini found the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which 179 to cremation and 14 to inhumation.\n\nThe Villanovans introduced iron-working to the Italian Peninsula. They practiced cremation and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name Villanovan of the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found near Villanova (Castenaso, 12 kilometres south-east of Bologna) in northern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, count Giovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The \"well tomb\" pit graves lined with stones contained funerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis at Verucchio overlooking the Adriatic coastal plain.\n\nThe burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300\u2013750 BC) and Celtic Hallstatt culture that succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed in cinerary urns, specifically in biconical urns and then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known as impasto. A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typical sgraffito decorations of swastikas, meanders, and squares were scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronze fibulae, razors and rings.\n\nPeriodization\nThe Villanovan culture is broadly divided into Villanovan I from c. 960 BC to c. 801 BC and the Villanovan II from c. 800 BC to 720 BC. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along the Amber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass and amber necklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings of bronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture. Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earlier cremation practices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particular Southern Etruria, entered the Orientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development as Villanovan III (750\u2013680 BC)  and Villanovan IV (680\u2013540 BC).\n\nVillanovan chronology within the Etruscan civilization\n\nMetalwork and trade \nThe metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.\n\nDuring the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.\n\nHousing \nBuildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy. Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.\n\nVillanovan settlements \nGenerally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the Adriatic Etruria, in Emilia Romagna (in particular, in Bologna and in Verucchio, near Rimini), in Marche (Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, in Tuscany and Lazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found in Campania, at Capua, at the \"princely tombs\" of Pontecagnano near Salerno, at Capo di Fiume, at Vallo di Diano and at Sala Consilina.\n\nSmall scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements\u2014largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally follows Massimo Pallottino in regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to the Etruscan civilization.\n\nGenetics\nA genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried in Veio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BC and 800 BC. She carried the maternal haplogroup K1a4. and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9% Copper Age ancestry (EEF + WHG) and 27.1% Steppe-related ancestry. There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara near Civitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former.\n\nSee also\nEtruscans\nProto-Villanovan culture\nPrehistoric Italy\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources and further reading\n\n \nGiovanni Gozzadini, La n\u00e9cropole de Villanova, Fava et Garagnani, Bologna, 1870\nJ.

It takes its name from the site of Villanovan, an ancient village in the Italian province of Emilia-Romagna, near Bologna, where in 1881\u201382, a number of cemetery sites were discovered, with artifacts characteristic of the culture. The Villanovan culture was a significant influence on the later Etruscan civilization. The Villanovan culture emerged from the earlier Final Bronze Age (1300\u20131100 BC), as a result of the invasion of the peninsula by the Sea Peoples and the subsequent collapse of several Mycenaean-like centres in southern Italy. The Villanovan culture was part of the Tyrrhenian cultural horizon, which also included the contemporary cultures of the Etruscans, the Celtic Hallstatt culture, and the Greek colonial world of Magna Graecia. The Villanovan culture is distinguished from the preceding and contemporary Italian cultures by a number of characteristics, such as: - Use of cremation - dominance of tombs - good quality pottery - the presence of weapons - the absence of imported luxury goods The characteristic handmade pottery of the Villanovan culture was made from local clays, and often featured a red slip. The remains of the Villanovan culture have been found in many parts of Italy, especially in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League), in the Po Valley, in Campania, in Basilicata, and in Sicily. In the 9th century BC, the Villanovan culture was succeeded by the Etruscan civilization, which developed in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League) and in the Po Valley. In the 6th century BC, the Etruscan civilization was in turn succeeded by the Roman Republic. The Villanovan culture is the basis for the modern Western alphabet, which is based on the Etruscan letters, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western alphabet. The Villanovan culture is also the basis for the modern Western calendar, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western calendar.

Otto Strasser, together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction, and broke from the party due to disputes with the dominant Hitlerite faction. He formed the Black Front, a group intended to split the Nazi Party and take it from the grasp of Hitler. This group also functioned during his exile and World War II as a secret opposition group.\n\nHis brand of Nazism is now known as Strasserism.\n\nCareer \n\nBorn at Bad Windsheim in the Kingdom of Bavaria, Otto Strasser took an active part in World War I (1914-1918). On 2 August 1914 he joined the Bavarian Army as a volunteer. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant and was twice wounded. He returned to Germany in 1919, where he served in the Freikorps that in May 1919 put down the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which was organized on the principles of workers' councils. About this time he joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1920 he participated in the opposition to the Kapp Putsch, but he grew increasingly alienated with his party's reformist stance, particularly when it put down a workers' uprising in the Ruhr, and he left the party later that year. In 1925 he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), in which his brother Gregor had been a member for several years, and worked for its newspaper as a journalist, ultimately taking it over with his brother. He focused particularly on the socialist elements of the  party's program and led the party's left faction in northern Germany together with his brother and Joseph Goebbels. His faction advocated support for  strikes, nationalization of banks and industry, and \u2013 despite acknowledged differences \u2013 closer ties with the Soviet Union. Hitler opposed some of these policies, judging them too radical and too alienating from parts of the German people (middle class and Nazi-supporting nationalist industrialists in particular), and the Strasser faction suffered defeat at the Bamberg Conference (1926), with Joseph Goebbels joining Hitler. Humiliated, Otto Strasser nonetheless, along with Gregor, continued as a leading Left Nazi within the party until Hitler expelled him from the NSDAP in 1930.\n\nAfter expulsion\nFollowing his expulsion, he set up his own party, the Black Front, composed of like-minded former NSDAP members, in an attempt to split the Nazi Party. His party proved unable to counter Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and Strasser spent the years of the Nazi era in exile. The Nazi Left itself was annihilated during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 \u2013 in which his brother Gregor Strasser was killed \u2013 leaving Hitler as undisputed party leader and able to pacify both industrialists and the military into accepting his new Nazi regime. In addition to the Black Front, Strasser at this time headed the  Free German Movement outside Germany; this group (founded in 1941) sought to enlist the aid of Germans throughout the world in bringing about the downfall of Hitler and his vision of Nazism.\n\nExile\nStrasser fled first to Austria, then to Czechoslovakia (Prague), Switzerland, and France. In 1940 he went to Bermuda by way of Portugal, leaving a wife and two children behind in Switzerland. In 1941 he emigrated to Canada, where he became the famed \"Prisoner of Ottawa\". During this time, Goebbels denounced Strasser as the Nazis' \"Public Enemy Number One\" and a price of $500,000 was set on his head. He settled for a time in Montreal. In 1942, he lived for a time in  Clarence, Nova Scotia, on a farm owned by a German-speaking Czech, Adolph Schmidt, then moved to nearby  Paradise, where he lived for more than a decade in a rented apartment above a general store. As an influential and uncondemned former Nazi Party member still faithful to many doctrines of Nazism, he was initially prevented from returning to West Germany after the war, first by the  Allied powers and then by the  West German government.\n\nDuring his exile, he wrote articles on Nazi Germany and its leadership for several British, American, and Canadian newspapers, including the New Statesman, and a series for the Montreal Gazette, which was ghostwritten by then-Gazette reporter and later politician Donald C. MacDonald.\n\nReturn to Germany and death\nIn 1950 East Germany invited Strasser to become a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, but he declined, hoping that he would be permitted to return to Bavaria, which had been under US occupation until 1949. In his view, West Germany constituted an American colony and East Germany a Russian colony. He eventually gained West German citizenship and settled in Munich.\n\nHe attempted to create a new \"nationalist and socialist\"-oriented party in 1956, the German Social Union (often called a successor to the 1949\u20131952, eventually forbidden Socialist Reich Party of Germany), but his organization was unable to attract any support. For the rest of his life, Strasser continued to advocate for  Strasserite Neo-Nazism until he died in Munich in 1974.\n\nOtto Strasser claimed he was a dissenting Nazi regarding racial policies. Throughout his life, he claimed to have actively opposed such policies within the Nazi movement, for example, by organizing the removal of Julius Streicher from the German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party.\n\nWritten works\n Hitler and I (translated by Eric Mosbacher and Gwenda David) [Hitler und Ich.

He was the younger brother of the party's founder and leader, Adolf Hitler. After the Nazi takeover of power in Germany in 1933, Strasser became disenchanted with the movement and broke with his brother. He was killed in mysterious circumstances in 1939. Strasser was born in Linz, Upper Austria, the fourth of the six children of Maria Augusta (n\u00e9e Schickelgruber) and Alois Hitler. His father was a customs official. TheHitler family was Catholic, and Otto was raised in that faith. He attended the state school in Linz and, like his older brother, Adolf, went on to the Linz Realschule. After completing his schooling there in 1916, he served in the Austrian Army from May to October that year, and was then transferred to the reserves. In December, he was called up for active service again, but was discharged in February 1917 because of heart problems. In June, he was conscripted into the German Army and fought on the Western Front until the end of the war. He was wounded in October 1918. After the war, Strasser completed his schooling and, like his brother, failed to gain admission to the Austrian officer academy. He then joined the right-wing Austrian Home Defence and served as a private. The following year, he became a member of the German National Socialist Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or NSDAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and the German Workers' and Soldiers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiter- und Soldatenpartei, or DAP), which the NSDAP soon absorbed. The NSDAP was then led by his brother, and the party's newspaper, the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter, was edited by Joseph Goebbels. In 1921, Strasser became the business manager of the newspaper. After the NSDAP's poor showing in the Reichstag elections of May 1924, Strasser, along with his brother and other party leaders, was convicted of treason in the Bamberg Court of Honor. The sentence, however, was not carried out, as the President of the Reichsgericht, Ludwig Guertner, granted an indefinite delay of execution. In the summer of 1924, Strasser joined the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei, or DVP). The following year, he became the business manager of the Deutsche Zeitung, a newspaper published by the DVP's successor, the National Party (Nationale Partei, or NP). He also managed the NP's affairs in Munich. In the autumn of 1925, the NP merged with the NSDAP to form the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or NSDA), which would be renamed the Nazi Party in 1933. Strasser remained a member of the new party, and in 1926 was appointed to its leadership in Munich. He also became the business manager of the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter, which was now the Nazi Party's newspaper, and, in 1927, the head of the party's publishing house, the Franz Eher Verlag. Strasser was one of the few early Nazi Party leaders who was not a member of the SA. He was, however, involved in the leadership of the party's economic organizations, and in 1928 became the chairman of the Business and Property Owners' Committee. In 1929, he became the head of the party's Economic Policy and Tax Office. The following year, he was elected to the Reichstag for the Munich North seat, and was made the chairman of the Nazi faction in the Bavarian Landtag. In the Reichstag, he sat on the Economic Committee and on the Committee on the Affairs of the German People's Group in Poland. In the Landtag, he was on the Committee for Economic and Agricultural Affairs. In February 1932, Strasser became the Nazi Party's propaganda chief, a position he would hold until his death. In March, he was made the party's organizational chief, and in May its business manager. In the Reichstag elections of July 1932, he was elected to represent Munich North. In November, he was elected to the Reichstag for Munich North and Munich II. In the Landtag elections, he was returned to the Bavarian legislature from Munich North. After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Strasser was named to the Reich government as Minister without Portfolio and as Deputy Minister of Transport. In the summer of 1933, he was elected to the Reichstag for Munich II. Strasser was the only one of the four Hitler brothers who was not killed in the Holocaust. However, his widow, Hedwig, was killed", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 579634}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bulls, New Zealand\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bulls is a small town north west of Palmerston North on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It is in a fertile farming area in the Rangitikei District at the junction of State Highways 1 and 3 about 135 kilometres (84\u00a0mi) north of Wellington. According to a  Statistics New Zealand estimate, Bulls has a population of  inhabitants.\n\nRecent marketing makes puns with the name, for example, \"New Zealand gets its milk from Bulls\" or the sign for the local police station \"Const-a-bull\".\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two recorded M\u0101ori toponyms for the area \u2013 Te Ara Taumaihi and \u014c-hine-puhiawe. The origins of Te Ara Taumaihi have yet to be explicitly explored. \u014c-hine-puhiawe, a land block where Parewahawaha marae is situated, acts as a synecdoche to refer to the current town area. The modern town name is named after James Bull who owned the first general store there. The town was originally called Bull Town, but this was changed to Clifton and then renamed back to Bulls at the urging of Sir William Fox.\n\nHistory and culture\n\nThe eastern end of the State Highway 1 bridge over the Rangitikei River south-east of the town collapsed suddenly in 1973 while being crossed by a bus. No-one was killed and the collapsed part was rebuilt.\n\nThe former Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital is 7\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) north of Bulls, the hospital closed in 1999. Lake Alice was a large contributor to the Bulls and Marton economy.\n\nBulls is covered by the Whanganui Chronicle, a daily paper part of the NZ Herald network that serves the Whanganui, Ruapehu and Rangit\u012bkei regions.\n\nMarae\n\nThe local Parewahawaha Marae is a traditional meeting ground for the Ng\u0101ti Raukawa hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Parewahawaha. It is on land known as Ohinepuhiawe.\n\nThe marae features the Parewahawaha meeting house, a whare tupana opened on 15 April 1967 by Maori Queen Te Atairangikaahu. At the time it was opened, Te Rangi Pumamao was the rangatira at Parewahawaha. He had finished construction of the house, as previous builders had died.\n\nIn October 2020, the Government committed $1,248,067 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae and 5 others, creating 69 jobs.\n\nDemographics\n\nBulls, which covers , had a population of 1,935 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 345 people (21.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 204 people (11.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 693 households. There were 972 males and 963 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.01 males per female. The median age was 32.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 477 people (24.7%) aged under 15 years, 426 (22.0%) aged 15 to 29, 759 (39.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 276 (14.3%) aged 65 or older.\n\nEthnicities were 78.1% European/P\u0101keh\u0101, 27.3% M\u0101ori, 7.8% Pacific peoples, 3.1% Asian, and 2.6% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).\n\nThe proportion of people born overseas was 14.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally.\n\nAlthough some people objected to giving their religion, 54.1% had no religion, 33.0% were Christian, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 3.9% had other religions.\n\nOf those at least 15 years old, 144 (9.9%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 321 (22.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $31,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 747 (51.2%) people were employed full-time, 171 (11.7%) were part-time, and 60 (4.1%) were unemployed.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nLocal government\n\nAs part of the Rangitikei District, the current Mayor of Rangitikei since 2013 is Andy Watson.\n\nBulls is the main town in the Southern ward of the Rangitikei District Council, which elects three of the eleven district councillors. The three councillors of the Southern ward are Brian Carter, Jane Dunn and Waru Panapa. The mayor and councillors are all due for re-election in October 2022.\n\nNational government\nBulls, like the rest of the Rangitikei District, is located in the general electorate of Rangit\u012bkei and the M\u0101ori electorate of Te Tai Hau\u0101uru. Rangit\u012bkei is a safe National Party seat since the 1938 election except for 1978\u20131984 when it was held by Bruce Beetham of the Social Credit Party. Since 2011 it has been held by Ian McKelvie.\n\nTe Tai Hau\u0101uru is a more unstable seat, having been held by three different parties since 1996, i.e. New Zealand First, the M\u0101ori Party and the Labour Party. Since 2014 it has been held by Adrian Rurawhe of the Labour Party.\n\nMilitary presence\nMany Air Force personnel from RNZAF Base Ohakea live in Bulls. In recent years several defence houses have been sold to civilian buyers which has seen a steady decline of servicemen from the area, but a moderate presence remains nonetheless.\n\nIn 2017 it was announced that the Republic of Singapore Air Force is looking at establishing a permanent F-15 fighter jet training base at Ohakea with an estimated presence of 500 Singaporean personnel. Ohakea and surrounding areas such as Bulls and Feilding would see a significant increase in military families and personnel to the area. In December 2018 it was announced that this would no longer go ahead.\n\nIn 2018 the incumbent government announced the purchase of four Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft for maritime surveillance. This announcement came with the news that the current New Zealand Defence Force unit responsible for maritime surveillance, No. 5 Squadron RNZAF, would be required to move to RNZAF Base Ohakea. This move would see a further increase in the number of service personnel living in the area. RNZAF is expected to take delivery of these aircraft in 2023.\n\nEducation \n\nBulls has two co-educational state primary schools for Year 1\u20138 students.\n\nBulls School was established in 1867 and is the oldest school in Rangitkei; it has a roll of  as of .\n\nClifton School, which opened more recently on the southern end of the township, has a roll of .\n\nSister city\nThe town's sister city is Cowes, England.\n\nNotable people\n Chris Amon, former Formula One driver between 1963\u20131976\n Travis Banks, professional wrestler\n Ormond Wilson, politician\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nUnforgetabull\n\nPopulated places in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\nRangitikei District\nPopulated places on the Rangit\u012bkei River", "machine_text": " Bulls, New Zealand, is a small town in the centre of the North Island, and is the service centre for the Rangitikei District.

The town has a population of 1,128 as of the 2006 Census, and is the seat of the Rangitikei District Council. The town's name is believed to have originated from a legend in which a bull was killed there after swimming the river during a flood. The Bulls area was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s, with the Moutoa Gardens area, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north-east of the present town, being the site of the first European habitation in the district. The town was founded in 1870 after the arrival of the railroad, and the original site of the town was at the intersection of Railway and High Streets, where the train station was located. The town was moved to its present site when the New Zealand Government completed the new railway line to Wellington in 1885. The original town was then demolished to make way for the present day town, with the old town's main street becoming the new town's High Street. The town is located on State Highway 1, and is also on the North Island Main Trunk railway line. It has a small railway station that is no longer in use, as the nearest station is in Taihape. The town has a number of historic buildings, including the Bulls Hotel, built in 1885, and the Empire Hotel, built in 1912. The town's high school, Bulls High School, was closed in 2007, but the town still has a primary school. Bulls was the original home of the international company Zespri, which was founded in the town in 1908 as the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board. The company's headquarters are now located in Mount Maunganui, and the company is now known as Zespri International.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 808864}

Ultimately, Dream City Film Club failed to find enough of an audience to sustain them.\n\nVocalist Michael J. Sheehy had been working as a solo singer/songwriter for several years when he met Alex Vald and Laurence Ash, who quickly began writing songs with Sheehy.  Upon the demise of another local group, Breed, bassist Andrew Park joined. The band's name came from a news story Sheehy had seen about an arsonist who had burned down a members-only porno theatre. They played their first gig as Dream City Film Club on 31 July 1995.\n\nThey released a single, \"Crawl\" for the underground fanzine, the Organ in early 1996.  Soon after, they were contacted by Beggar's Banquet and recorded their eponymous debut album in late 1996, later releasing it on 26 May 1997.\n\nAccording to Sheehy, the English press reaction to the first single, \"Perfect Piece of Trash\", was almost unanimous in its derision.  After parting with Vald, DCFC continued on as a three piece, recording its second and final album, In the Cold Light of Morning featuring a more expansive sound best realized on the epic \"God Will Punish the Pervert Preacher\".\n\nThe group disbanded in 1999.  Michael J. Sheehy subsequently recorded three solo albums for Beggar's Banquet and two for Glitterhouse, and has fronted Saint Silas Intercession with his brother Patrick. During the early 2000s, Alex Vald worked as half of experimental pop band Datapuddle.

C. Little under the name Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory. (Roscoe B. Jackson was a one-time head of the Hudson Motor Company who helped provide the funds for the first laboratory building at the property and the first five years of operation.)\n\n Established that cancer is a genetic disorder, a novel concept before the Laboratory's founding in 1929.\n Dr. Leroy Stevens first described cells that can develop into different tissues \u2013 today known as stem cells. \n Dr. Elizabeth Russell performed the first bone marrow transplants in a mammal, leading to new treatments for blood and immunological diseases.\n Dr. George Snell won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for providing an in-depth understanding of the immune system's major histocompatibility complex, making organ transplants possible.\n Dr. Douglas L. Coleman discovered the hormone leptin, central to obesity and diabetes research, earning him the Shaw Prize, the Albert Lasker Award, the Gairdner International Award, Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine, and the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine.\n Is pioneering the use of cancer avatars \u2013 mice with implanted human tumors \u2013 to test targeted therapies for cancer patients.\n\nRecent research has provided insight into cancer stem cells and treatments for leukemia; progress with type 1 diabetes and lupus; and a breakthrough in extending mammalian life span.\n\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) first received its National Cancer Institute designation in 1983 in recognition of the foundational cancer research conducted there. The JAXCC is one of seven NCI-designated Cancer Centers with a focus on basic research.\n\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center has a single program, \"Genetic Models for Precision Cancer Medicine,\" composed of three biological themes: cancer cell robustness, genomic and genetic complexity, and progenitor cell biology. The themes emphasize the systems genetics of cancer and translational cancer genomics, and all are supported by the JAX Cancer Center's technological initiatives in mouse modeling, genome analytics and quantitative cell biology.\n\nThe Morrell Park fire\nOn May 10, 1989, a flash fire destroyed the Morrell Park mouse production facility. The fire raged for five hours, requiring over 100 firefighters from 15 companies and a total of 16 trucks for the fire to be contained. Four workers of the Colwell Construction Company who were installing fiberglass wallboard in the room where the fire broke out were injured, one with burns over 15 percent of his body. While none of the foundation strains were lost, 300,000 production mice (about 50% of their stock) died, resulting in a national shortage of laboratory mice and the layoff of 60 employees.\n\nThis was the second fire to severely affect the laboratory; the 1947 fire that burned most of the island destroyed most of the laboratory, and its mice. Worldwide donations of funds and mice allowed the lab to resume operations in 1948.\n\nResearch resources\n Hosts the Mouse Genome Informatics database, by far the world's most significant source for information on mouse genetics and biology.\n Distributes more than 3 million JAX mice annually to more than 20,000 investigators in at least 50 countries for research and drug discovery.\n Offers more than 11,000 genetically defined strains of JAX mice to the international research community.\n Provides animal husbandry, reproductive science and in vivo drug efficacy services in a wide range of therapeutic areas for biomedical researchers.\n Conducts over 100 educational seminars and webinars yearly to educate and enable external biomedical researchers.\n\nEducational programs\n\n Summer Student Program has brought thousands of talented high school and college students to campus over 89 years for mentoring, including three who later won Nobel Prizes: David Baltimore, Howard Temin and Jack Szostak. \n Nearly 700 students, researchers and physicians attend Laboratory courses, conferences and workshops annually.\n Participates in three collaborative degree programs: the Tufts University Ph.D. program in Genetics, the Ph.D. program in Biomedical Sciences of the University of Maine, and the Master's of Science in Teaching program of the University of Maine.  \n Offers predoctoral and postdoctoral training programs and a visiting scientists program.\n Coordinates and hosts the Maine State Science Fair for high school students.\n\nBusiness model\nThe Jackson Laboratory is recognized by the IRS as a public charity.

In the 1950s, the laboratory's research focus shifted to the study of mouse genetics, and the laboratory was renamed the Jackson Laboratory in 1956 after a $1 million gift from Mary Stillman Harkness (the widow of Edward Stephen Harkness Jr.) and her brother Charles Stillman, both of whom were residents of Bar Harbor. The Jackson Laboratory has been a major resource for research on the genetics of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases, as well as for research on the mouse as a model for genetic research. The laboratory has more than 2,000 employees, and is one of the largest employers in Bar Harbor. The laboratory has an annual budget of more than $100 million, and is the second largest non-profit genetics research institution in the United States, after the Broad Institute. In 2017, the Jackson Laboratory was ranked #1 in the world for scientific impact in mouse research, and #3 in the world for scientific impact in genetics research. The Jackson Laboratory is a key resource for the international research community. The laboratory's scientists and technicians study and catalog the DNA of mice in an effort to determine which genes may be associated with disease. Researchers at the laboratory have developed thousands of different lines of mice, each with a different gene or combination of genes. These mice are then studied to determine the effects of the genes on physiology and behavior. The laboratory's research also focuses on the ethical issues involved with genetic research. The laboratory is one of the leading centers for the study of the societal and ethical issues associated with the use of genetic information in research and in the clinic, and is home to the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy, which was established in 2009 with a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor. The Jackson Laboratory also provides resources and services to other research institutions, including the JAX\u00ae Mouse Colony Management Program, which helps other laboratories manage and maintain mouse colonies, and the JAX\u00ae Genomic Services Laboratory, which provides genome sequencing and analysis services. The Jackson Laboratory's research has been featured in many national and international media outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Science, Nature, Time, Newsweek, and The Washington Post. The laboratory's research has also been featured in several documentaries, including the NOVA science documentary \"The Truth About Mutant Cancer Genes\" and the BBC Horizon documentary \"The Gene Hunters\".", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2804240}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"European Rugby Champions Cup\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The European Rugby Champions Cup (known as the Heineken Champions Cup for sponsorship reasons) is an annual rugby union tournament organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR). It is the top-tier competition for clubs whose countries' national teams compete in the Six Nations Championship. Clubs qualify for the Heineken Champions Cup via their final positions in their respective national/regional leagues (English Premiership, French Top 14, and United Rugby Championship) or via winning the second-tier Challenge Cup; those that do not qualify are instead eligible to compete in the second-tier Challenge Cup.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2014, the equivalent competition was known as the Heineken Cup and was run by European Rugby Cup. Following disagreements between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition, it was taken over by EPCR and its name was changed to the European Rugby Champions Cup, without title sponsorship. Heineken returned as sponsor for the 2018\u201319 season, resulting in the competition being known as the Heineken Champions Cup.\n\nToulouse are the current holders of the title, having won their record setting fifth title by beating Stade Rochelais in the 2021 final.\n\nHistory\n\nHeineken Cup\n\n1995\u20131999\n\nThe Heineken Cup was launched in the summer of 1995 on the initiative of the then Five Nations Committee to provide a new level of professional cross border competition. Twelve sides representing Ireland, Wales, Italy, Romania and France competed in four pools of three with the group winners going directly into the semi-finals. English and Scottish teams did not take part in the inaugural competition. From an inauspicious beginning in Romania, where Toulouse defeated Farul Constan\u0163a 54\u201310 in front of a small crowd, the competition gathered momentum and crowds grew. Toulouse went on to become the first European cup winners, eventually beating Cardiff in extra time in front of a crowd of 21,800 at Cardiff Arms Park.\n\nClubs from England and Scotland joined the competition in 1996\u201397. European rugby was further expanded with the advent of the European Challenge Cup for teams that did not qualify for the Heineken Cup. The Heineken Cup now had 20 teams divided into four pools of five. Only Leicester and Brive reached the knock-out stages with 100 per cent records and ultimately made it to the final, Cardiff and Toulouse falling in the semi-finals. After 46 matches, Brive beat Leicester 28\u20139 in front of a crowd of 41,664 at Cardiff Arms Park, the match watched by an estimated television audience of 35 million in 86 countries.\n\nThe season 1997\u201398 saw the introduction of a home and away format in the pool games. The five pools of four teams, which guaranteed each team a minimum of six games, and the three quarter-final play-off matches all added up to a 70-match tournament. Brive reached the final again but were beaten late in the game by Bath with a penalty kick. Ironically, English clubs had decided to withdraw from the competition in a dispute over the way it was run.\n\nWithout English clubs, the 1998\u201399 tournament revolved around France, Italy and the Celtic nations. Sixteen teams took part in four pools of four. French clubs filled the top positions in three of the groups and for the fourth consecutive year a French club, in the shape of Colomiers from the Toulouse suburbs, reached the final. Despite this it was to be Ulster's year as they beat Toulouse (twice) and reigning French champions Stade Fran\u00e7ais on their way to the final at Lansdowne Road, Dublin. Ulster then carried home the trophy after a 21\u20136 win over Colomiers in front of a capacity 49,000 crowd.\n\n1999\u20132004\nEnglish clubs returned in 1999\u201300. The pool stages were spread over three months to allow the competition to develop alongside the nations' own domestic competitions, and the knockout stages were scheduled to take the tournament into the early spring. For the first time clubs from four nations \u2013 England, Ireland, France and Wales \u2013 made it through to the semi-finals. Munster's defeat of Toulouse in Bordeaux ended France's record of having contested every final and Northampton Saints' victory over Llanelli made them the third English club to make it to the final. The competition was decided with a final between Munster and Northampton, with Northampton coming out on top by a single point to claim their first major honour.\n\nEngland supplied two of the 2000\u201301 semi-finalists \u2013 Leicester Tigers and Gloucester \u2013 with Munster and French champions Stade Fran\u00e7ais also reaching the last four. Both semi-finals were close, Munster going down by a point 16\u201315 to Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Lille and the Tigers beating Gloucester 19\u201315 at Vicarage Road, Watford. The final, at Parc des Princes, Paris, attracted a crowd of 44,000 and the result was in the balance right up until the final whistle, but Leicester walked off 34\u201330 winners.\n\nMunster reached the 2001\u201302 final with quarter-final and semi-final victories on French soil against Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Castres. Leicester pipped Llanelli in the last four, after the Scarlets had halted Leicester's 11-match Heineken Cup winning streak in the pool stages. A record crowd saw Leicester become the first side to successfully defend their title.\n\nFrom 2002, the European Challenge Cup winner now automatically qualified for the Heineken Cup. Toulouse's victory over French rivals Perpignan in 2003 meant that they joined Leicester as the only teams to win the title twice. Toulouse saw a 19-point half-time lead whittled away as the Catalans staged a dramatic comeback in a match in which the strong wind and showers played a major role, but Toulouse survived to win.\n\nIn 2003\u201304 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) voted to create regions to play in the Celtic League and represent Wales in European competition. Henceforth, Wales entered regional sides rather than the club sides that had previously competed. English side London Wasps had earned their first final appearance by beating Munster 37\u201332 in a Dublin semi-final while Toulouse triumphed 19\u201311 in an all-French contest with Biarritz in a packed Stade Chaban-Delmas in Bordeaux. The 2004 final saw Wasps defeat defending champions Toulouse 27\u201320 at Twickenham to win the Heineken Cup for the first time. The match was widely hailed as one of the best finals. With extra time looming at 20\u201320, a late opportunist try by scrum half Rob Howley settled the contest.\n\n2005\u20132014\nThe tenth Heineken Cup final saw the inaugural champions Toulouse battle with rising stars Stade Fran\u00e7ais when Murrayfield was the first Scottish venue to host the final. Fabien Galthi\u00e9's Paris side led until two minutes from the end of normal time before Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak levelled the contest for Toulouse with his first penalty strike. He repeated this in the initial stages of extra time and then sealed his side's success with a superb opportunist drop-goal. Toulouse became the first team to win three Heineken Cup titles.\n\nIn 2006, Munster defeated Biarritz in the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, 23\u201319. It was third time lucky for the Irish provincial side, who had previously been denied the ultimate prize twice by Northampton and Leicester.\n\nThe 2006\u201307 Heineken Cup would be distributed to over 100 countries following Pitch International's securing of the rights. That season was the first time in the history of the competition that two teams went unbeaten in pool play, with both Llanelli Scarlets and Biarritz doing so. Biarritz went into their final match at Northampton Saints with a chance to become the first team ever to score bonus-point wins in all their pool matches, but were only able to score two of the four tries needed. Leicester defeated Llanelli Scarlets to move into the final at Twickenham, with the possibility of winning a Treble of championships on the cards, having already won the Anglo-Welsh Cup and the English Premiership. However, Wasps won the final 25 points to 9 in front of a tournament record 81,076 fans.\n\nDuring competition there was uncertainty over the future of the tournament after the 2006\u201307 season as French clubs had announced that they would not take part because of fixture congestion following the Rugby World Cup and an ongoing dispute between English clubs and the RFU. It was speculated that league two teams might compete the next season, the RFU saying \"If this situation is not resolved, the RFU owes it to the sport to keep this competition going...We have spoken to our FDR clubs, and if they want to compete we will support them.\". A subsequent meeting led to the announcement that the tournament would be played in 2007\u201308, with clubs from all the six nations. On 20 May it was announced that both French and English top-tier teams would be competing\n\nIn the 2008 final, Munster won the cup for their second time ever by beating Toulouse at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n\nLeinster won the title in 2009 in their first ever final after beating Munster in the semi-final in front of a then world record Rugby Union club match attendance in Croke Park. They beat the Leicester Tigers in the final at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. They also beat Harlequins 6\u20135 in the quarter-finals at Twickenham Stoop, in the famous Bloodgate scandal.\n\nIn the 2010 final, Toulouse defeated Biarritz Olympique in the Stade de France to claim their fourth title, a Heineken Cup record.\n\nThe 16th Heineken Cup tournament in 2011 resulted in an Irish province lifting the title for the fourth time in six years as Leinster recorded their second triumph in the competition. They defeated former multiple Heineken Cup winners Leicester and Toulouse in the quarter- and semi-finals. At the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, in front of 72,000 spectators, Leinster fought back from a 22\u20136 half-time deficit in the final against Northampton Saints, scoring 27 unanswered points in 26 second-half minutes, winning 33\u201322 in one of the tournament's greatest comebacks. Jonathan Sexton won the man-of-the-match award, having scored 28 of Leinster's points total, which included two tries, three conversions, and four penalties.\n\nLeinster successfully defended their crown in 2012 at Twickenham, eclipsing fellow Irish province and former champions Ulster 42\u201314 to establish the highest Heineken Cup final winning margin. The performance broke a number of Heineken Cup Final records. Leinster became only the second team to win back-to-back titles, and the only team ever to win three championships in four years. In addition, the game had the highest attendance at a final (81,774), the highest number of tries (5) and points (42) scored by one team and the highest points difference (28).\n\nThe final edition of the tournament as constituted as the Heineken Cup was won for a second time by Toulon at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in May 2014.\n\nChampions Cup\n\n2014\u201318\nThe tournament began on 17 October 2014, with Harlequins playing Castres Olympique in the first ever Champions Cup game. Toulon retained their title, beating Clermont 24\u201318 in a repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final, thereby becoming the first club to win three European titles in a row.\n\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, all Round 1 games due to take place in France that weekend were called off, along with the Round 2 fixture between Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Munster. Rescheduling of some matches was difficult, partly caused by fixture congestion due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nSaracens won their first title defeating Racing 92 in Lyon 21\u20139 in 2016 final and followed it up with their second in 2017, beating Clermont 28\u201317 in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 2017\u201318 season, Leinster overcame the \"pool of death\" consisting of Glasgow Warriors (who finished the 2017\u201318 season top of the Pro14), Montpellier (who finished the 2017\u201318 season top of the TOP 14) and Exeter (who finished the 2017\u201318 season top of the English Premiership), beating all three teams both home and away. Leinster went on to face the back to back Champions Saracens, dispatching a defeat at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, to set up a semi-final against reigning Pro12 champions Scarlets. Leinster defeated Scarlets to face Racing 92 in Champions Cup Final in Bilbao. Leinster defeated Racing 92 by a scoreline of 15\u201312, becoming only the second team in history to earn four European titles. Leinster also won the Pro14 title to become the first Pro14 side to win such a double of trophies.\n\nHeineken Champions Cup\n\n2018\u20132020\nSaracens won the 2018\u201319 competition, defeating defending champions Leinster 20\u201310 in the final. Saracens were in breach of the Premiership salary cap during this edition and the previous year, in which they qualified for the 2018\u201319 cup. However, the EPCR have confirmed that Premiership ruling will not affect the results of the Heineken Champions Cup for 2018\u201319 or previous years, stating: \"The Saracens decision is based on Gallagher Premiership Rugby regulations and does not affect the club's European record or current status in the Heineken Champions Cup.\" There were no Saracens representatives at the launch of the 2019\u201320 competition, held in Cardiff on 6 November 2019. EPCR released a statement saying they were \"disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019\u201320 season launch\".\n\n2020\u2013\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020\u201321 competition took on a revised format. A similar but revised 24 team format will remain for 2021\u201322.\n\nFormat\n\nQualification\nTypically, a total of 24 teams qualify for the competition, the same number as used to qualify for the Heineken Cup. At least 23 of the 24 teams qualify automatically based on position in their respective leagues. The winner of the Challenge Cup will earn a place regardless of league position.\n\nTeam distribution is typically:\nEngland: 8 teams, based on position in Premiership Rugby\nFrance: 8 teams, based on position in the Top 14\nIreland, Italy, Scotland and Wales: 8 teams, based on performance in the United Rugby Championship (previously the Pro14).\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the best placed team from each country in the Pro14 qualified for the competition, along with the best three remaining teams regardless of nationality\nIn 2017, it was announced that this format would change. Starting with qualification for the 2018\u201319 competition, the Pro14 places would be assigned regardless of nationality, rather than the requirement that at least one team qualify from each participating nation.\n\n20th team qualification (-2020) \nUntil 2018\u201319, the final team each season qualified through a play-off competition between the best placed unqualified teams. \nFor the 2014\u201315 season, this was a two legged play-off between the seventh-placed teams in the Top 14 and the English Premiership. The team with the highest aggregate score over the two legs advancing to the Champions Cup.\nFor the 2015\u201316 season, there was a three-team play-off; the seventh-placed team in the English Premiership, or the winners of the 2014\u201315 European Rugby Challenge Cup if members of the English Premiership and not already qualified, would play the eighth-placed (or highest non-qualified) team from the Pro14, with the winner playing the seventh-placed team in the Top 14.\nTo facilitate Rugby World Cup 2015, there were no play-offs for the 2016\u201317 Champions Cup with the 20th place going to the winner of the 2016 Challenge Cup if not already qualified.\nFor 2017\u201318, the play-off format included four clubs with a second Pro14 club competing. If not already qualified, the winner of the Challenge Cup will take the place in the play-offs of the seventh-ranked club in the English Premiership and Top 14, and will also take the place of the second Pro14 club if applicable.\nIn May 2017, it was announced that, starting with qualification for the 2018\u201319 Champions Cup, the play-off will be scrapped in favour of awarding the final berth using the following criteria:\nChampions Cup winner, if not already qualified.\nEuropean Rugby Challenge Cup winner, if not already qualified.\nChallenge Cup losing finalist, if not already qualified.\nChallenge Cup semi-finalist, if one has not already qualified (or the winner of a play-off between the semi-finalists, if both have not already qualified).\nHighest ranked non-qualified club by virtue of league position from the same league as the Champions Cup winner.\n\nCompetition\n\nGroup stage\nFor the pool stage teams are placed into pools via a draw. The teams are ranked based on domestic league performance the previous season, and arranged into four tiers. Teams are then drawn from the tiers into pools at random, with the restriction that no team will be drawn in the same pool as another team from the same league and tier.\n\nTeams will play two other teams in their pool from a different league twice, at home and away, and match points will be awarded depending on the result of each game, with teams receiving four points for a win, and two for a draw. Teams can also earn bonus points for scoring four or more tries and/or for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\n\nFollowing the completion of the pool stage, 16 teams qualify for the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup with a further 6 of the remaining 8 dropping into the Challenge Cup.\n\nKnock-out stage\nThe sixteen remaining teams are seeded from 1\u201316 based on performance in their respective pool.  The round of 16 is played over two legs with each team playing both home and away. The quarter-finals are unbracketed, and follow the standard 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 format, as found in the Heineken Cup.\n\nThe winners of the quarter-finals will contest the two semi-finals, Up to and including the 2014\u201315 season, matches and home country advantage were determined by a draw by EPCR.\n\nIn 2015\u201316, EPCR decided to put a new procedure in place. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\". Semi-final matches must have been played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.\n\nSince 2018\u201319, the higher-seeded team will have home country/venue advantage for each semi-final regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road. The EPRC may now also use its discretion to allow semi-finals to be played at a qualified club's home venue.\n\nThe winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, which will be held in May each season.\n\n2020\u2013 \nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020\u201321 competition took on a revised format.\n\nA similar format will remain for 2021\u201322.\n\nFinals\n\nWins by club\n\nWins by nation\n\nControversy\n\nDisagreements over structure & governance\nEnglish and French rugby union clubs had long held concerns over the format and structure of the Heineken Cup organised by European Rugby Cup (ERC), predominantly in relation to the distribution of funds and an imbalance in the qualification process. Some proposals had been made that, in future, rather than Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy each sending their top-placed teams in the Pro14 to the Heineken Cup, the top teams from the league as a whole should be sent, regardless of nationality. This founding principle was eventually conceded however, when it was agreed that the top-placed teams from the four should participate in the new European competition.\n\nIn June 2012, following that year's final, Premiership Rugby and the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), on behalf of the English and French clubs respectively, gave ERC two years' notice of withdrawing from the Heineken Cup and also the second-tier Challenge Cup competitions from the start of the 2014\u201315 season. Soon after, in September, Premiership Rugby announced a new four-year TV deal worth \u00a3152\u00a0million with BT Sport including rights for English clubs' European games - which had previously been the sole responsibility of ERC. ERC responded with claims that Premiership Rugby did not have the rights to a European tournament and announced a four-year deal with Sky Sports. The actions of Premiership Rugby were said to have \"thrown northern hemisphere rugby into disarray\".\n\nSubsequently, in September 2013, the English and French clubs announced their intention to organise their own tournament, to be named the Rugby Champions Cup, from 2014 to 2015 season onwards, and invited other European clubs, provinces, and regions to join them. The IRB (now World Rugby) stepped into the debate at the same time to announce its opposition to the creation of a breakaway tournament. In October 2013, Regional Rugby Wales, on behalf of the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup. Negotiations for both a new Heineken Cup and Rugby Champions Cup were then ongoing.\n\nOn 10 April 2014, following almost two years of negotiations, a statement was released under the aegis of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) announcing that the nine stakeholders to the new competition, the six unions, and three umbrella club organisations (Premiership Rugby, LNR, and Regional Rugby Wales), had signed Heads of Agreement for the formation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and a new, third tournament, initially called the Qualifying Competition and now known as the European Rugby Continental Shield. On the same day, BT and Sky announced an agreement that divided coverage of the new European competitions. Both will split the pool matches, quarter-finals, and semi-finals equally, and both will broadcast the final. BT will get first choice of English Premiership club matches in the Champions Cup, with Sky receiving the same privilege for the Challenge Cup.\n\nPremiership Rugby and LNR were described as having employed \"bully-boy tactics\" by The Irish Times.\n\nOrganisation\nShortly after the establishment of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to administer the new competition from a new base in Neuchatel, Switzerland, the running of the inaugural 2014\u201315 tournament was subcontracted to the organisation it had been meant to replace, Dublin-based European Rugby Cup (ERC). This was despite the latter having been described by chairman of Premiership Rugby, Quentin Smith, as \"no longer fit for purpose\". This was described as \"something of an about-turn\" by The Daily Telegraph.\n\nEPCR were still looking to hire a permanent chairman and director-general more than a year after their establishment.\n\n2015 final\nThe inaugural Champions Cup final was brought forward by three weeks due to a French desire not to interrupt their domestic playoffs. This was said to have \"devalued\" and \"diminished the status of the occasion as the pinnacle of European club rugby\".\n\nWhile the 2015 Heineken Cup final had been due to take place at the San Siro in Milan, the first European final to take place in Italy, the new organisers decided to move it to Twickenham Stadium in London in order to \"guarantee the best possible financial return to clubs\". However, with less than two weeks to go before the final took place, it was reported that fewer than half of the stadium's 82,000 seats had been sold, with just 8,000 French supporters travelling to London to watch Toulon face Clermont. The organisers subsequently made \"free\" tickets available on Ticketmaster (with only a \u00a32 booking fee applicable), before admitting to this being a mistake \u2013 the offer supposed to have been linked to a purchase of a Premiership final ticket. This was described as an \"embarrassing fiasco\" by the Western Mail in Wales. 56,622 fans subsequently attended the game. EPCR were said to have \"failed on many levels\" by The Irish Times, with the attendance figure for the final \"a fitting postscript to the hastily-convened decider to what was, after all the brinkmanship, a hastily-convened tournament\".\n\nSponsorship and suppliers\n\nSponsors\nDuring the creation of the Champions Cup, former organisers ERC had been criticised for \"failing to maximise the commercial potential\" of the Heineken Cup. New organisers EPCR pledged to move from a single title sponsor format to a Champions League-style partner system, with 2\u20133 primary partners projected for the inaugural tournament and 5 being the ultimate target. However, only Heineken agreed to sign up for the 2014\u201315 season, at a much reduced price from that which they had been paying previously.\n\nPrincipal partners\nHeineken (1995\u20132014; 2018\u2013Present) \n Heineken, who had sponsored the Heineken Cup since 1995, signed on as the first partner for the Champions Cup in 2014, and were credited as the Founding Partner of European Rugby. They returned to the competition as title sponsors in 2018, resulting in it being renamed as the \"Heineken Champions Cup\". Due to French restrictions on alcohol advertising, it is known as the \"H Cup\" in France.\nTurkish Airlines (2015\u20132017)\n Announced as the second principal partner at the 2015\u201316 tournament launch, signing on for three seasons\n\nSuppliers\nWebb Ellis \u2013 Match balls and officials' kit (2003\u20132009)\nAdidas \u2013 Match balls and officials' kit (2009\u20132014)\nCanterbury of New Zealand \u2013 Match officials' kit (2014\u20132016)\nGilbert \u2013 Match balls (1998\u20132002; 2014\u2013) and officials' kit (2016\u20132019)\nKappa \u2013 Match officials' kit (2019\u2013)\nTissot \u2013 Official watch and timekeeper (2015\u2013)\nFollowing their appointment as an official supplier, Tissot began sponsoring the match officials' kit\n\nPlayer records\nNote that in the case of career statistics, only those clubs for which each player appeared in European Cup fixtures (i.e. Heineken Cup or Champions Cup) are listed.\n\nCareer records\n\nTries\n\n Players in BOLD still playing for an EPRC qualified team.\n\nPoints\n\n Players in BOLD still playing for an EPRC qualified team.\n\nGoals \nThe number of goals includes both penalties and conversions.\n\nAppearances\n\nSingle season records\n\nTries\n\nPoints\n\nEuropean Player of the Year\n\nThe European Player of the Year award was introduced by ERC in 2010.

Coverage was split between the two in order to raise revenues, but this was said to have \"diluted the focus and reduced the buzz around the event\".\n\nAttendance\nThis lists the average attendances for each season's European Cup competition, as well as the total attendance and highest attendance for that season. The final is typically the most-attended match, as it is generally held in a larger stadium than any club's home venue.\n\nThe highest attended match of the 2002\u201303 competition was a quarter-final between Leinster and Biarritz before 46,000 fans at Lansdowne Road in Dublin.\n\nThe 2009 final held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh was only the third most-attended match that season. The most-attended match was a semi-final between Irish rivals Leinster and Munster played in Croke Park in Dublin. The attendance of 82,208 set what was then a world record for a club match in the sport's history. Second on that season's list was a pool match between Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Harlequins that drew 76,569 to Stade de France in Paris (a venue that Stade Fran\u00e7ais has used for select home matches since 2005).\n\nWhile the 2010\u201311 tournament's highest attended match was unsurprisingly the final, the second-highest attended match was notable in that it was held in Spain. Perpignan hosted Toulon in a quarter-final before a sellout crowd of 55,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nSee also\n\n List of European Rugby Champions Cup finals\n European Rugby Challenge Cup\n Premiership (England)\n United Rugby Championship (Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales)\n Top 14 (France)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\n \nRugby union competitions in Europe for clubs and provinces\n1995 establishments in Europe\nRecurring sporting events established in 1995\nMulti-national professional rugby union leagues\nMulti-national professional sports leagues", "machine_text": " European Rugby Champions Cup The European Rugby Champions Cup is an annual rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR).

It was established in 1935 and occupies most of 9 Fitzmaurice Place, a street connecting Berkeley Square to Curzon Street in Mayfair.\n\nHistory\n\nThe club formed later than many London clubs, and it permitted women from its inception. It has always had a relatively young membership, with an active social scene. The building's main Adam and otherwise 1930s Art Deco interiors, with some authentic frontages, mean it has been Grade II* listed since its first assessment in 1970. This is the mid-category of listed building, a statutory scheme of protection which has a pyramidal hierarchy.\n\nIn 1930, Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square by creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of the main range of Lansdowne House, which stood since the 1760s. What remained was given a new frontage and a newly renovated interior, and became the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was thus taken to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the 'Dining Room' exists in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\nThe venue was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many rivals, it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. Its facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing Salle and a basement gym with Art Deco swimming pool. Internally architecture is extremely unusual; some is modern for its type, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian styles. The Adam Room and other parts of the club on the ground floor are Georgian though.\n\nThe building underwent extensive renovation and further modernisation in 2000.

It is the largest fishing port in the country and on the island of Ireland. It is located on the south coast of the county, north of Donegal Bay, near Donegal Town. Its Irish name Na Cealla Beaga means 'little cells', a reference to early monastic settlements. The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward. In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional \"Blessing of the Boats\". , the population was 1,236.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.\n\nThe railway line opened on 18 October 1893 on the Donegal Railway Company line from Donegal to Killybegs railway station.\n\nThe Donegal Town to Killybegs branch of the County Donegal Railway terminated at the harbour and some of the remains can still be seen to this day. The railway was closed on 1 January 1960.\n\nFishing industry\n\nKillybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 metres at low water spring tide at the new \u20ac50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.\n\nThe town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting.  The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town.  This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.\n\nEducation\n\nThe first national school, known as 'Killybegs National School', and later as the 'Commons National School', opened in 1834 on a site originally provided by the Plantation Commissioners in the reign of King James I\nThere are three national schools and one second-level school in Killybegs as well as a third level institution Tourism College Killybegs, the only dedicated tourism institute in Ireland, offering courses in hospitality and culinary skills. The college has been academically integrated with Letterkenny Institute of Technology since 2001.\n\nSt Catherine's Vocational School is a non-denominational, co-educational second-level school. There are twenty-six teaching staff, five special needs assistants and three support staff. The student population is 348 and the male-to-female student ratio is approximately 50:50. The present two-storey building opened in 1987 provides facilities for students, teachers and members of the community. St Catherine's has a range of extracurricular activities, the school has had success in English, Irish and science debates. The arts are well provided for with an art and music department, the music department has staged a number of musical productions, students are taught a variety of instruments. Sport is also an important aspect of school life students participate in teams representing the school in soccer, Gaelic football, athletics, basketball and rugby.\n\nBeach\n\nFintra beach (registered blue flag) is located on the outskirts of Killybegs town. It consists entirely of fine golden sand and receives large numbers of day-trippers during the peak of the tourist season. It is lifeguarded throughout the bathing season.\n\nDonegal Carpets\n\nKillybegs is famous for its tapestries and carpets, some of which were produced on the biggest carpet loom in the world at the \"Donegal Carpet Factory\". The carpets, known as Donegals, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in and internationally the Vatican, The White House, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime & Heritage Centre.  The Centre provides information on the carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot.\n\nSport\n\nThe local GAA club is Na Cealla Beaga. They play their home games at Eamon Byrne Memorial Park.\n\nThe local association football club, St Catherine's, was founded in 1896.

It is the largest fishing port in Ireland and is often referred to as the \" busiest fishing port in Europe\". The town is situated on the south coast of the county, on the Atlantic Ocean, near the mouth of the River Fintown (or Finvoy). The town's name is derived from the Irish words _C\u00e9al_ (pron. \"kaal\") meaning \"sheltered\", and _Beag_ (pron. \"beg\") meaning \"small\". Killybegs was once the central base of the Irish fishing industry, but due to overfishing and severe depletion of the fish stocks, the industry has experienced a dramatic decline. The town's dependence on the fishing industry has made it vulnerable to the ups and downs of the fishing trade and the loss of a large number of jobs has caused the population to decrease significantly in recent years. In the 2006 census, the population of the town was 1,232. The 2011 census recorded a population of 1,068. There is evidence of ancient settlement in the area. A number of ringforts and passage graves are in the vicinity of the town. The ruins of the early Christian church of Kilteevoey are near the town. The church is built on the site of an earlier monastery, founded by an order of nuns in the 6th century. The monastery was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the nuns were known as the \"Sisters of the Final End\". Killybegs is a sheltered natural harbour. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was a major fishing port, primarily because of its proximity to the rich fishing grounds of the Donegal Bay and the Irish Sea. During the Second World War, Killybegs was a base for the Royal Navy's Atlantic convoys. In recent times, Killybegs has become a popular tourist destination. There are a number of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in and around the town. The town also has a fine 18th-century church, which was built by the Franciscans. The town's central location makes it a good base for exploring the south and west of County Donegal.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 996575}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"All the Boys Love Mandy Lane\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is a 2006 American slasher film directed by Jonathan Levine and starring Amber Heard, Michael Welch, Whitney Able, and Anson Mount. The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.\n\nOriginally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of film festivals throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Toronto International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, and London FrightFest Film Festival. It received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane received mixed reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as \"bogus and compromised\", and others praising its \"grindhouse\" aesthetic and likening its cinematography to the early work of Terrence Malick and Tobe Hooper.\n\nDespite its international attention, the film remained unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from The Weinstein Company. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States. The film became available through video on demand in September 2013, and was given a limited release on October 11, 2013, through a joint contract between Senator Entertainment and Weinstein's subsidiary label Radius-TWC.\n\nPlot\nAt a Texas high school, Mandy Lane blossoms over the summer, attracting her male classmates. One of them, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house. She accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet can come along. At the party, Dylan bullies and humiliates Emmet until Mandy intervenes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump from the roof into the pool, but Dylan fails to scale the pool, and smashes his head on the concrete, which kills him.\n\nNine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been subjected to even more intense bullying. Their stoner classmate Red plans a weekend party at his father's remote cattle ranch, and Mandy reluctantly accepts an invitation from Chloe, a popular but insecure cheerleader. Mandy accompanies Red and Chloe, along with several other classmates\u2014reserved football player Bird, and couple Jake and Marlin\u2014to Red's ranch. Upon arriving, they are introduced to Garth, the ranch hand.\n\nThat night, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs oral sex on him. They have another argument, and after he walks back to the house, an unseen assailant knocks Marlin out and breaks her jaw with the barrel of a shotgun. Back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy. Anxious about Marlin, he takes Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for her. He eventually finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head and breaks Marlin's neck, killing both.\n\nEmmet drives back to the ranch in Red's truck and sees the rest of the group on the porch. He shoots fireworks at them. Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake, playing a prank. Emmet confronts Bird and attacks him, eventually slashing his eyes with a knife and stabbing him to death. The rest of the group, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.\n\nThe next morning, as the group leaves out the front door, Emmet shoots and wounds Garth. While Mandy tends to Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car. Emmet shoots Red and chases after Chloe. In Garth's shack, Mandy retrieves the keys to his Bronco and finds the bloodied knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction. Mandy embraces Chloe, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is in league with Emmet.\n\nAs Chloe bleeds to death, Mandy and Emmet discuss the suicide pact they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her, but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times. Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses. Mandy grabs a log and defends herself against Emmet's machete. Eventually she gets the upper hand and kills him. She returns to an injured Garth and they drive away from the ranch. Garth thanks Mandy for saving him, assuming she was merely a victim.\n\nA flashback shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While the rest goof off, Mandy balances on the tracks and watches her future victims.\n\nCast\n\nAnalysis\nSeveral film critics have drawn comparisons between the events in the film and those perpetrated by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the teenagers responsible for the Columbine massacre\u2014in particular, the character of Emmet, who in one scene is shown wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.\n\nFilm scholars Cristelle Maury and David Roche, in their introduction to Women Who Kill: Gender and Sexuality in Film and Series of the Post-Feminist Era (2020), note that the film inverts the trope of the \"final girl\" by revealing her to be a \"diabolical mastermind.\" Writing of the revelation, they note: \"As Mandy beckons her, Chloe runs right into her friend's arms, impaling herself on a knife in a back shot that prevents us from anticipating such an outcome...\u00a0 The twist is merely a millennial update of the ending in Friday the 13th (1980), with two significant differences: Mandy's sadism warrants no justification, and as the film's Final Girl, she is the audience's stand-in.\"\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film had initially been conceived in 2003 when writer Jacob Forman, producer Chad Feehan, and production designer Tom Hammock were all students at the American Film Institute. \"I actually started it as my thesis at AFI,\" Feehan told Twitch Film. \"The writer, Jacob Forman and the production designer Tom Hammock and I did it as our thesis together at AFI. We started working on it in 2003, then graduated and got it financed and were able to hire our friends that we graduated with to make the movie. It was obviously quite a journey from 2003 to 2006 when we sold it to the Weinstein Company, and after that it's been pretty trying.\"\n\nLevine later told the Austin Chronicle that he and screenwriter Jacob Forman had drawn inspiration from Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) as well as the NBC television series Friday Night Lights and John Hughes films. According to Levine, he and cinematography Darren Genet had also drawn inspiration from The Virgin Suicides (1999) and Dazed and Confused (1993) when developing the film's depiction of teenagers.\n\nLead performer Amber Heard said that when she received the script for the film in Los Angeles, she felt it was noticeably \"different\".  In an interview, she said, \"There are so many [scripts] you get where it feels like you're reading the same girl over and over again. And then I read this script and I thought it was truly different and that it could be done well. This was a movie that was really under the radar; no one was really talking about it. It didn't have much money and subsequently it didn't get much attention right off the bat.\"\n\nCasting\nIn conceiving her character, Heard stated that Mandy Lane \"[represents] many, many real girls. Many real teenagers, especially in America. There are a lot of incidents of this kind of violence in school with the perpetrators being cute teenagers against their classmates. Their victims are their classmates and they're often their bullies.... [Mandy]'s a great representation of all those girls who are insecure and uncomfortable with their sexuality and their power and yet they're strangely intrigued by it and tempted by it.\"\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on location in Austin, Texas, and nearby Bastrop in 2006, on a budget of $750,000. According to Amber Heard, she spent little time with the rest of the cast when filming wasn't taking place in order to maintain a distance necessary to her character. She also said that the shoot was very low-maintenance, saying, \"Everyone has these expectations, whether they're subconscious or not, of the glamour and how much fun that you can have in L.A. and I went with those same expectations. This was my first shoot, my first leading role. I fly to my hometown, funnily enough, to film and I stand out in this field waiting for my hair and make-up. Instead of the chair, instead of the lights, I stand in the middle of a field and have, literally, a bucket of freshly-dug mud dumped on my head.\"\n\nAnson Mount recalled the film shoot as being \"very well organized by the producers. All we had to do was show up to work and have a good time. It was a very aggressive production by what was then a very young company, Occupant.\"\n\nRelease\nAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane premiered on September 10, 2006, at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by screenings at the Sitges Film Festival, South by Southwest, London FrightFest Film Festival, the IFI Horrorthon, at the French Cinemath\u00e8que.\n\nDistribution\nUpon the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006, film executive Harvey Weinstein, \"in characteristically aggressive deal-making mode,\" sought to purchase distribution rights after its screening ended around 1:30 am. By 5:00 am on September 11, 2006, an agreement was reached, and a contract was signed later that morning, with The Weinstein Company officially purchasing global distribution rights for a reported $3.5 million. In the contract, Weinstein committed to giving the film a wide release in the United States under the Weinsteins' Dimension Films branch. Harvey Weinstein's brother Bob Weinstein, who managed Dimension Films, reportedly did not feel the film warranted a wide release: \"I didn't feel that it was the right way to approach an artful film like this,\" he said. A test screening was undertaken in New Jersey, after which less than 30% of the audience reported a positive response, leaving the Weinsteins reluctant to give the film a wide release.\n\nDespite the poor test screening, Dimension Films slated the film for a U.S. release of July 20, 2007. However, due to the subsequent financial failure of the studio's Grindhouse, among other horror films, the Weinstein Company instead sold the film to Senator Entertainment US. Senator, a German company who had acquired distribution rights for the film in Germany and Austria, had recently established a U.S. branch. An American release through Senator never materialized, however, after the company's U.S. branch went out of business in April 2009, leaving the film held in limbo with other unreleased projects.\n\nIn 2008, the film was screened at the G\u00e9rardmer Film Festival, Lyon L'\u00c9trange Festival, and the Fantasia Film Festival, and received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008, through Optimum Releasing. Between 2008 and 2010, it continued to open in various foreign markets, receiving theatrical releases in Germany and Austria (through Senator), as well as in Sweden, Mexico, Peru, and the Netherlands, among others.\n\nAt Comic-Con 2010, director Levine and star Heard appeared for a screening of the film, and hinted that a North American release was finally forthcoming, though they did not say when or who would be handling the release. In the spring of 2013, it was reported that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired distribution rights to the film. Several months later, the film was released on demand in North American markets through The Weinstein Company subsidiary, Radius-TWC, on September 6, 2013, and given a limited theatrical release on October 11, 2013, in the United States\u2014over seven years after its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBox office\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom in February 2008, the film grossed a total of US$400,851. It garnered an additional $482,500 in Germany upon its June 2008 release there. It was released in various other countries over the course of 2008 and 2009, and by April 2010 had grossed an international total of $1,893,697, more than covering its $750,000 budget.\n\nCritical response\nThe film received mixed reviews upon its initial festival screenings and subsequent European theatrical release in 2008. It holds a 46% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus states: \"Mandy Lane has enough wit and craft to spark the horror fans' interest, but is not sufficiently original for mainstream audiences.\" On the website Metacritic, the film received a score of 44 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIt received a favorable review from The Globe and Mail, who wrote that it \"displays an intelligence lacking in most teen slasher pics,\" and Film Threat called the film \"a well-shot, [...] semi-cerebral horror film.\" eFilmCritic wrote that the film's writing of its titular character is flawed, but it \"evokes the rich landscapes of early Terrence Malick and the grimy grindhouse tales of the \u201870s, converging poetically into its heartmashing climax. This is a film where the blood and carnage doesn\u2019t feel like corn syrup or CGI and each death grows in sadness, not quality.\" Bloody Disgusting called it \"a solid entry into the slasher genre and a pretty damn good teen thriller too boot.\" Other critics gave the film less flattering reviews, with The Guardian calling it \"bogus and compromised: an unreconstructed horror romp in the guise of a nerdish intellectual.\" Slant Magazine said the film \"flaunts its knowledge of classic genre fundamentals but fails to do anything very clever or surprising with them,\" and later compared its cinematography and aesthetic mood to The Virgin Suicides (1999). Tim Robey of The Telegraph called the film \"arrestingly well shot for a low-budget horror,\" but noted that it had an \"anorexic plot.\"\n\nThe film continued to receive mixed reviews upon its theatrical release in the United States in October 2013. Nicholas Rapold of The New York Times praised the film, noting that \"cinematographer Darren Genet draws from long shots of pursuits and a vaguely 1970s look, which wasn\u2019t cutting-edge during the film\u2019s making but suits the real-time nostalgia of high school activities, even murderous ones,\" and Scott Weinberg of FEARnet said the film \"[brings] a quietly artistic taste of teen-aged sexual politics to a subgenre that's generally disinterested in anything resembling brains, wit, or subtext.\" The Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review as well, calling it \"a small, tightly coiled spellbinder,\" and praised Heard's performance, referring to it as her most \"definitive [performance] to date.\"\n\nThe New York Post gave the film a less favorable review, calling it \"A slightly artsy attempt to revive the teen slasher movie [that] drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece.\" Christy Lemire of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"[With the opening scene], Levine promisingly sets a dark and disturbing tone. But the vast majority of the film, which takes place nine months later, is a rather standard depiction of the bad kids trying to corrupt the last American virgin.\" Lemire also commented on the film's delayed release history, stating: \"Its attempts at examining and subverting the well-worn conventions of the genre in the script from Jacob Forman might have seemed more novel seven years ago. But by now we've seen this approach executed much more effectively\u2014and thrillingly.\" The Washington Post, however, praised the film's acting and thematics, writing: \"Thoughtful viewers may detect thematic whiffs of Columbine, blended with Carrie that darken and complicate the film\u2019s aroma of stale blood. Thoughtful viewers? What kind of teen slasher movie is this? Too dumb for the arthouse, but too smart for the mall multiplex, the movie satisfies, paradoxically, precisely because it doesn\u2019t deliver on expectations.\"\n\nIn his book Nightmare Movies: Horror on Screen Since the 1960s, film scholar Kim Newman likened the film's teenage characters to the troubled youth in works by Richard Linklater or Larry Clark.\n\nHome media\nAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane was released on Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom in a Region 2 format on July 21, 2008, by Optimum Home Entertainment. It was released in North America on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 format on December 3, 2013, through Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n\nSoundtrack\nAlthough an official soundtrack was not released, the film features the following songs:\n\n \"In Anticipation of Your Suicide\" by Bedroom Walls\n \"84\" by  Nude\n \"Slowly, Just Breathe\" by Dead Waves\n \"Good Day\" by Kunek\n \"Our Lips Are Sealed\" by The Go-Go's\n \"Thin Air\" by Brian Jennings\n \"Sister Golden Hair\" by Gerry Beckley, covered by Juliette Commagere\n \"Do Ya\" by Peaches\n \"Piano Concerto No. 5 in E Flat Major, Second Movement\" by Ludwig van Beethoven\n \"Oh Molly Dear\" by B.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chicago City Railway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Chicago City Railway Company (CCRy) was an urban  transit company that operated horse, cable, and electric streetcars on Chicago's South Side between 1859 and 1914, when it became merged into and part of the Chicago Surface Lines (CSL) metropolitan-wide system. After that time it owned electric streetcars, along with gasoline, diesel, and propane \u2013 fueled transit busses. Purchased by the government agency  Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in 1947, it was liquidated in 1950.\n\nBeginnings (C.C.Ry.)\nIn the 1850s,  Chicago was growing and better public transportation was needed. Horse drawn omnibuses were shuttling passengers between several recently built interstate railroad stations for radiating lines like spokes of a wheel by 1853, but city/town  streets, roads and turnpikes were often muddy, rutted and potholed with travel  very difficult. In 1858, omnibus operator Frank Parmelee and a group of investors were awarded a city franchise for a rail horsecar line, but legal challenges caused them to seek a state charter instead. On February 14, 1859, the Chicago City Railway Company (C.C.Ry.) was incorporated and in two months horsecars were running on State Street between Randolph and 12th Streets.\n\nHorsecars \nThe horsecars were a success from the start. The smooth rail and reduced rolling resistance allowed larger cars to be used in all weather. A typical car was  long,  wide, and could carry 20 passengers.\n\nAlthough horsecar lines were inexpensive to build, they were expensive to operate. Horses could be up to  of the value of a company. They were expensive to buy, needed people to maintain them, were subject to illness, and made a huge amount of manure/waste. By 1880, the C.C.Ry. was looking for a better, mechanical replacement.\n\nCable cars \nIn 1880, superintendent Charles Holmes visited San Francisco to see the new and successful cable car lines there, and could see a use for cable cars in Chicago. As with most cities which would use cable cars, the problem in flat-landed Chicago was not one of grades and steep hills and valleys, but of pure transportation capacity.\n\nConstruction began in 1881 on a system designed by William Eppelsheimer, with lines going south from the downtown area on main thoroughfare State Street and Wabash-Cottage Grove Avenues. This system was to become the largest and most profitable cable car system in the world.\n\nState Street service started on January 28, 1882, Cottage Grove Avenue on February 26. Counter to some people's expectations, the cable cars did not suffer much from the elements, and the harsher Chicago climate with extreme variations in summer heat and winter cold was no problem for them.\n\nThe number of passengers caused a different approach to the cars than the San Francisco cable car system. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like the \"California Cars\", CCRy used short bi-directional grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.\n\nThe cable cars did not completely replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to trolleys, the electrical cars from some feeder lines had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown area, due to the lack of trolley wires there.\n\nElectric streetcars \n\nAs the cable system was being built electric traction was being developed. Although the individual cars cost more, stringing wire cost far less per mile than digging conduits. In 1892, the Chicago City Council allowed C.C.Ry.'s first electric lines. Since the cable lines were already effective, and there was opposition to wires downtown, electric cars were used to replace horsecars on feeder routes when they became available. It was not until 1906, that all CCRy lines were converted to electricity. From then on, the CCRy primarily operated electric streetcars.\n\nChicago Surface Lines (C.S.L.) \nBy 1900, political corruption, unscrupulous actions by other companies, and public opinion made it difficult for the street railways to plan ahead. Length and terms of franchises, fare caps, taxes, and property owner consent were some of the problems.\n\nPublic ownership was discussed, but instead, city ordinances controlling the private companies were passed and appealed for years. One was the Unification Ordinance of November 13, 1913 by the Chicago City Council, which combined management and operations of all Chicago streetcar companies as the Chicago Surface Lines  (C.S.L.), taking effect in 1914. The C.C.Ry. became a \"paper company\". It continued to own equipment, but the equipment was operated by the C.S.L. and used systemwide throughout the metropolitan area.\n\nThe CSL was eventually sold to the publicly owned, government agency, Chicago Transit Authority after 88 years of private operations and 34 years since consolidation, on April 22, 1947, and the CCRy was liquidated on February 15, 1950.\n\nRemnants \nIn 2015  yard switcher CSL #L202 and flat car CTA #314 are at the Fox River Trolley Museum in South Elgin, Illinois.

The system was formed in 1911 as the result of the merger of two companies: the Chicago City Railway Company, a street railway company, and the Chicago Elevated Railway Company, an elevated railway company. The Chicago City Railway was a predecessor of the Chicago Transit Authority. The Chicago City Railway operated a fleet of about 1,500 streetcars and 200 elevated trains, and covered a territory of about 100 square miles (260 km2), extending from the Chicago Loop to the city limits. It had about 70 routes, and the average distance between stops was about two-thirds of a mile (1.3 km). In 1913, the Chicago City Railway launched a new service, called the Super Motor, which used high-speed luxury cars that made few stops. The Super Motors ran every six to ten minutes during the rush hours, and every 20 minutes during the off-peak hours. They were an immediate success, and by 1914, the Chicago City Railway was running about 200 Super Motors every day. The Chicago City Railway also operated a network of articulated buses, and a service called the Chicago Motor Coach. The Chicago Motor Coach was a hybrid service that used both buses and streetcars. The buses would operate on the streets, and the streetcars would operate on the tracks, but both vehicles would be operated by the same company, and would be integrated into a single network. In 1924, the Chicago City Railway was acquired by the Chicago Surface Lines, which in turn was acquired by the Chicago Transit Authority in 1947.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1368489}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wesley O. Smith\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Wesley Oliver Smith (April 16, 1878October 20, 1951), commonly known as W. O. Smith, was an American newspaper publisher and businessman from southern Oregon.  He owned the Klamath Republican and later the Evening Herald, both Klamath Falls newspapers.  Smith was a Republican who served two two-year terms in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing what are today Crook, Deschutes, Grant, Jefferson, Klamath, and Lake counties.\n\nEarly life \n\nSmith was born on April 16, 1878 in French Lake, an unincorporated area of New Brunswick, Canada.  He was the son of George F. Smith and Anna Smith.  His family left Canada and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, when he was eight years old.\n\nIn 1895, Governor William H. Upham commissioned Smith as a second lieutenant in the Wisconsin National Guard.  He served in Company E of the Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry from the time of his commissioning to August 1897.  Company E was based in Eau Claire.  With the onset of the Spanish\u2013American War, Smith rejoined the Wisconsin National Guard as a non-commissioned officer.  He served as first sergeant for Company E.  After the war, Smith moved to Harrison, Idaho, where he briefly worked cruising timber before moving on to Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nLife in Klamath Falls \n\nIn Klamath Falls, Smith worked for a short time in the lumber business. Then in 1903, he bought the Klamath Republican from W. Huse and Sons.  The Klamath Republican was a weekly newspaper that had been published in Klamath Falls since 1896.  When he took charge of the paper, Klamath Falls had five newspapers competing for reads in a community of only 3,000 people.\n\nSmith married Jessie Applegate on December 11, 1904.  She was the youngest daughter of Captain Ivan D. Applegate, an early Klamath County pioneer.  Nine months later, she died in Klamath Falls, three days after giving birth to a son.  Smith married his second wife, Lena L. Hargus, on October 24, 1906.  She was the widow of Doctor H. B. Hargus, and was also the sister of Smith\u2019s first wife.  They remained together for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1908, Smith acquired another Klamath Falls newspaper, the Evening Herald (now the Herald and News), from its founder Fred Cronemiller.  After buying the Evening Herald, he purchased and installed a new Linotype machine, the first automated typesetting machine in the Klamath Falls area.  Under his management, the Evening Herald became the area\u2019s leading newspaper.  Smith continued to publish the Klamath Republican along with the Herald.  He eventually changed the Klamath Republican from a weekly to a semi-weekly publication.  In 1914, he merged it in to the Evening Herald as a semi-weekly supplement.\n\nSmith also started a printing business in Klamath Falls.  His printing firm was called W. O. Smith Printing Company.  While it was separate from his newspaper, it was located in the same building as the Evening Herald.\n\nSmith was also a prominent member of the Klamath Falls community.  He was active in civic affairs and local politics.  He helped finance construction of the local Odd Fellows building, the first large office building in Klamath Falls.  He also joined the local Elks lodge and helped raise funds to build the Klamath Falls Elks building.  Smith later served as president of the local Elks lodge.  In politics, he was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, serving as a recording clerk for the Klamath Falls voting precinct and then as chairman of the Klamath County Republican Central Committee.\n\nState representative \n\nIn 1912, Smith decided to run as a Republican for a District 21 seat in the Oregon House of Representatives.  At that time, District 21 had two seats that represented Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties as well as Crook County (which at that time, still included what are now Deschutes and Jefferson counties).  Smith and Vernon A. Forbes of Bend were the only Republicans to file for the District 21 seats. Since the Republican Party was allowed to nominate two candidates for the two District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were both nominated in the Republican primary.  Since no Democratic candidates filed for the District 21 seats, Smith and Forbes were unopposed in the general election.\n\nSmith took his seat in the Oregon House of Representatives on January 13, 1913, representing District 21.  He worked through the 1913 legislative session which ended on March 5.  During the session, he served on the powerful ways and means committee as well as the irrigation committee.  Later in the session, Smith was appointed to a special committee assigned to investigate conditions in Oregon\u2019s state prisons.  Smith was an active member of the House throughout the session.  A fiscal conservative, Smith successfully pushed a bill through the legislature that standardized government accounting within the state.  After the session, he received special recognition from eastern Oregon farmers for his work on the irrigation committee.\n\nIn 1914, Smith decided to run for re-election, seeking to retain his District 21 House seat.  He was joined by fellow incumbent Republican, Vernon Forbes.  There were also two candidates running in the Democratic primary, P. H. Dencer of Bend and Fred W. Hyndman of Klamath Falls.  Since there were two District 21 seats available both parties could nominate two candidates for the general election.  As a result, all four candidates were advanced to the general election.  In the November election, Smith and Forbes retained their House seats.  The final general election tally was 1,366 votes for Smith, 1,157 votes for Forbes, 982 votes for Hyndman, and 742 votes for Dencer.\n\nSmith began his second term representing House District 21 on January 11, 1915. The session lasted six weeks, ending on February 20.  During the session, Smith was appointed to the ways and means, irrigation, military affairs, and printing committees.\n\nIn 1916, Smith ran for a third term in the Oregon House of Representatives.  Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created.  While these changes did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district.  While Smith and Forbes had been the only two Republicans to file for the District 21 seats in the past two elections, two additional Republicans decided to join the field in 1916.  The two new Republican candidates were Denton G. Burdick of Redmond and Albert E. Elder of Klamath Falls.  In addition, Fred Hyndman filed as a Democrat.  In the Republican primary, Forbes and Burdick were advanced to the general election while Hyndman was nominated in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 1920 and 1922, several Oregon newspapers identified Smith as a possible candidate for one of the District 21 seats.  However, he did not run for state office again.\n\nLater life \n\nAfter his 1916 primary defeat, Governor James Withycombe appointed Smith as Oregon\u2019s delegate to the International Farm Congress and the International Irrigation Congress.  Both meetings were held in El Paso, Texas, in October 1916.\n\nIn 1920, Smith sold the Evening Herald to E. J. Murray so he could focus on his commercial printing business.  He modernized the company's printing operation, acquiring a new press with an automatic press feeder system.  In 1926, Smith moved his business to a new modern building in downtown Klamath Falls. Four years later, W. O. Smith Printing Company merged with Drummond Printing of Klamath Falls.  The new business brought together a full suite of modern printing equipment under one roof.  The company was incorporated in 1929 as Smith-Bates.  It was capitalized at $50,000 with 500 shares valued at $100 per share.  Smith and his wife were primary shareholders.\n\nInstead of returning to state politics, Smith ran for a city council position in Klamath Falls.  He was elected and took his seat in 1921.  He served two terms on the city council.  After leaving the council, he continued to serve Klamath Falls as chairman of the city\u2019s budget committee.  In 1930, the city of Klamath Fall decided to update its city charter.  Smith was appointed chairman of the 15-person committee that evaluated various options for improving the city\u2019s government.  His committee recommended the city adopt a new form of government based on a city manager structure.\n\nSmith also remained involved in fraternal and civic affairs.  He was active in the local Elks lodge.  He helped establish a Boy Scout program in Klamath Falls.  Smith was also a founding member of the local Rotary club and was that organization\u2019s first president. In addition, he served as president and trustee of the local golf country club.  \n\nDue to an extended illness, Smith was confined to his home for the last six years of his life.  He died at his home in Klamath Falls on October 20, 1951 at the age 73.  His funeral service was held at the Klamath Falls Elks lodge on October 23, 1951.  Smith was buried in the Linkville Cemetery in Klamath Falls.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n List of Oregon Legislators by Session\n Wesley Oliver Smith at Find a Grave\n\nMembers of the Oregon House of Representatives\nPoliticians from Klamath Falls, Oregon\nOregon city council members\nOregon Republicans\nBusinesspeople from Oregon\nEditors of Oregon newspapers\n1878 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Sunbury County, New Brunswick\nCanadian emigrants to the United States\nWisconsin National Guard personnel\nPoliticians from Eau Claire, Wisconsin\nPeople from Kootenai County, Idaho\n19th-century American people\n20th-century American people", "machine_text": " Wesley O.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fushun\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fushun (, formerly romanised as Fouchouen, using French spelling, also as Fuxi ()) is a prefecture level city in Liaoning province, China, about  east of Shenyang, with a population of 2,138,090 inhabitants (2010 census) and a total area of ,  of which is the city proper. Situated on the Hun River (\"muddy river\"), it is one of the industrial and economic development hubs in Liaoning.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ming dynasty first constructed Fushun walled city in 1384. \"Fushun\" is an abbreviation of the Chinese \"(\", literally \"to pacify the frontiers; to guide the Yi foreigners\".\n\nThe Jurchen (Manchu) leader Nurhaci married his granddaughter by his son Abatai to the Ming dynasty General Li Yongfang after Li surrendered Fushun in 1618. The offspring of Li received the \"Third Class Viscount\" () title.\n\nFushun was in ruins in the one-and-a-half centuries of early Qing dynasty. In 1783, the new walled city was completed southwest of the old city. In 1908, Fushun became the seat of Xingren County (, later renamed to Fushun County). Fushun was occupied by Russia until 1905 and by Japan until 1945. With the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia and signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the South Manchuria branch (from Changchun to L\u00fcshun) of the China Far East Railway was transferred to Japanese control. South Manchuria Railway Company quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions. Coal mines were developed at Fushun. Under the control of the Japanese and with 30 years of development, Fushun area became highly industrialized. Fushun gained city status in 1937.\n\nPopulation\nFushun has 2.14\u00a0million inhabitants, including 1.34\u00a0million in the urban area. It is now part of the Shenyang-Fushun built-up area (comprising all the urban and suburban districts of Shenyang and Fushun) which was home to 6,756,379 inhabitants in 2010. This makes Shenyang-Fushun the 8th most populous built up area in China after the Pearl River Delta conurbation of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhongshan and Huizhou, then Shanghai-Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou-Shaoxing, Wuhan and Nanjing.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nFushun consists of 4 districts, 1 county and 2 autonomous counties.\n\nEconomy\n\nFushun is a highly industrialized area and nicknamed \"the City of Coal\". It has developed as a thriving center for fuel, power and raw materials and is also offering more and more opportunities in textiles and electronics. One of the world's largest open-pit coal mines, the West Open Mine, is located south of the city. Exploited from the 12th century, it was operated as an open pit mine during the 20th and early 21st Century; however, as of 2015, the West Open pit, 1,000 feet deep, with an area of 4.2 square miles, was exhausted and unstable. Total coal production in Fushun as a whole had fallen below 3\u00a0million tons, down from 18.3\u00a0million tons in 1962. Fushun has a major aluminum-reduction plant and factories producing automobiles, machinery, chemicals, cement, and rubber.\n\nThe total GDP of the city of Fushun was 54.27 billion yuan in 2009 (ranked 4th out of the 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province). The GDP per capita of the city of Fushun was 40391 yuan in 2009. (ranked 21st out of all 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province).\n\nResources\n\nFushun is rich in wood, coal, oil shale, iron, copper, magnesium, gold, marble, titanium, and marl resources.\n\nFushun is known as \"the capital of coal\". The main coal and oil shale company is Fushun Mining Group, which produced about 6\u00a0million tons of coal in 2001, mainly blending coking coal and steam coal. The company also has coalbed methane resources of around 8.9\u00a0billion cubic meters. In addition, it owns geological reserves of high grade oil shale, about 3.5\u00a0billion tons, of which the exploitable reserve is 920\u00a0million tons.\n\nIndustrial development\nHydroelectric and thermal power are important locally available energy sources.\n\nFushun has developed through the utilization of the abundant natural mineral deposits found in the area and is a nationally important heavy industrial base for petroleum, chemical, metallurgy machinery and construction material industries. New sectors also becoming prominent are electronics, light industry, weaving and spinning.\n\nIn 1928, the commercial-scale production of shale oil began in Fushun with the construction of Fushun Coal Mine Temporary Oil Plant () of South Manchurian Railway, aka the Western Refinery (), operating Fushun-type retorts. After World War II, shale oil production ceased, but 100\u00a0Fushun-type oil shale retorts and the related shale oil processing units were restored in 1949. In 1950, a total of 266\u00a0retorts were in operation, each with a capacity of 100\u2013200\u00a0tonnes of shale oil per day. In 1954, \"Refinery No. 2\" began production and in 1959 maximum annual shale oil production increased to 780,000\u00a0tonnes.\n\nFrom 1965 oil shale usage in Fushun started to decline with the discovery of Da Qing oil field in the 1960s. Sinopec, a shale oil producer during those times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In the same year, the China National Oil Shale Association was established in Fushun.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Fushun Mining Group operated the largest shale oil plant in the world, consisting of seven retorting units with 20\u00a0retorts in each unit, for a total 140 sets of Fushun type retorts.\n\nThere are also two oil refineries. Fushun Petrochemical Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina, is building a refining and petrochemical complex in Fushun.\n\nTransportation\nFushun is located  from Shenyang Taoxian airport. Railways and highways connect the city to Shenyang and Jilin Province. The seaports of Dalian and Yingkou are also nearby,  away respectively, with good highway connections.\n\nEducation\n\nThe highest-ranked institution of higher education is the Liaoning University of Petroleum and Chemical Technology, ranked 123rd in China overall. Fushun No.1 High School and Fushun No.2 High School are major high schools in Fushun.\n\nThe 44 middle school is located in the second street, Xin Fu District. Location is close to FuShun's CBD. Transport is very convenient.  All students come from this community. Because of the population's decline in current years there are not many students compared to 10 years ago. There were over 1000 students in the 1990S, while now around 200 students.\nAlthough the number of students has dropped, the quality of education, the advanced learning facilities and modern school are still evident. \nThere are indoors gymnasium, big dance and musical instrument rooms. The play yard is all about synthetic surface track. \nThe 44 middle school is actually changed in term of their learning and teaching's facilities, equipment and school's building. \nIt represents new outlooks regarding middle-level education in a third-line city in China.\n\nTourism\n\nFushun has high mountains and thick woods. Houshi National Forest Park, about  from Fushun city centre, is rated by the central government as an AAAA tourist attraction. Saer Hu Scenic Area covers some . It includes the  Dahuofang Reservoir, the largest man-made lake in northeast China.\n\nThere are a number of historic and cultural sites. Fushun's success in applying for two UNESCO World Heritage sites is expected to attract more tourists. They include a site known as Xingjing City, the origin of the Qing Dynasty, which is within today's Fushun. It was the first capital of the Late Jin dynasty, dating to 1616. The second site contains the Yongling tombs, where several members of the royal household are buried.\n\nIn more recent times, Fushun was where Lei Feng was stationed as a soldier and died, and a memorial museum telling his life story is a popular attraction. It is located at Wang Hua District in Fushun. It was also in Fushun that the last emperor, Puyi, was imprisoned after the end of World War II. The Fushun War Criminals Management Centre is converted into a museum in 1986. Another war memorial, the Pingdingshan Tragedy Memorial Hall Ruins, tells the story of a massacre of Chinese people by the Japanese in 1931. It was rebuilt and expanded in 2007. It includes a pit filled with about 800 bodies\u2014largely infants, adults, and the elderly who were killed by the Japanese.\n\nThe Ring of Life monument opened in 2013 and features an observation deck overseeing the city. This circular tower, 515-foot (approximately 157 meters) tall, cost over $15 million to build. It is covered with 12,000 LED lights.\n\nIn addition, Red River Valley in Fushun has opened a number of summer resorts. Tourists can travel down the river on small rubber rafts through mountain scenery; the valley is called 'the first rafting route in northern China'. Fushun Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall. This is a memorial to a large massacre that occurred in Fushun.\n\nSports\nThe city used to be home of the Chinese Super League (soccer) team of Liaoning FC at Leifeng Stadium. However, when the team could not afford the rent at the Leifeng Stadium it moved to Beijing, where it now plays out of Chaolai Soccer Base in the northeastern part of that city.\n\nNotable figures\n Nurhaci, the first Manchu ruler, was born in today's Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County. \n Lei Feng, who was a soldier enshrined in new China history after 1949, died in this city. There is a memorial park named after him in Fushun's Wanghua District.\n Li Xianglan, also known as Yoshiko Otaka, Yoshiko Yamaguchi, or Shirley Yamaguchi, was a famous Fushun-born ethnic Japanese singer and movie star in China during the 1930s and 1940s.\n Wang Nan, famous table-tennis sportswoman, who has won many gold medals around the world.\n Puyi, the last Emperor of China, spent ten years in a Fushun War Criminals Management Centre.\n\nThe film The Lover starring Tony Leung Ka Fai described a love story between a young French woman and a young man from Fouchouen.\n\nSister cities\n\nInternational \n\n  Lipa City, Batangas, Philippines\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Fushun official website\n Liaoning Business Guide: Fushun\n\n \nCities in Liaoning\nPrefecture-level divisions of Liaoning", "machine_text": " Fushun is a county-level division of Fushun City, Liaoning Province, China.

The mine has estimated reserves of 1.58 billion tonnes of coal and a total surface area of 18,620 km2 (7,200 sq mi). The mine is part of the Fushun Mining Group, which was founded in 1937. The city's symbol is a stylized \"F\" with a miners' hat above it. In the 1930s, Fushun was the site of a large Japanese prisoner of war (POW) camp, where captured British, American, and other Allied soldiers were held. The Japanese camp was infamous for its harsh conditions, and the captors were accused of torturing and executing POWs. The Soviet Union invaded the area in the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation in the final days of World War II, and captured the city of Fushun on 16 August 1945. Fushun is home to the Fushun University, a comprehensive university with an emphasis on engineering. Fushun is known for its annual snow and ice festival, which attracts many tourists. Fushun was the site of a nuclear weapons accident on 21 May 1980. An experimental nuclear reactor, the HT-3, suffered a cooling system failure and subsequently a core-meltdown. The HT-3 was one of the test reactors designed to develop technology for the CANDU-type nuclear reactors.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Norton, Doncaster\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Norton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster (part of South Yorkshire, England), on the border with North Yorkshire.\n\nThe civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census.   The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary.\n\nHistory \nLittle is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.\n\nAt a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and \u2018several estates\u2019 to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.\n\nFollowing the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\u2019s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.\n\nThroughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.\n\nVillage today \nIn the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.\n\nSee also\nListed buildings in Norton and Askern\n\nReferences\n\n \nNorton\nCivil parishes in South Yorkshire", "machine_text": " Norton, Doncaster, is a village and civil parish in the English county of South Yorkshire. It is in the Doncaster borough, and is roughly coterminous with the area served by the Norton Comprehensive School. It is close to the A1, and is also served by the A19 and A630 roads. The M18 motorway passes through the parish, to the east of the village. The village lies on a natural aquifer, and has a number of springs, two of which are in the village centre. One of these is marked by a stone basin, which was once a horse trough. This feature gave the village its name, Norton, which means \"North town\" in Old English. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, as \"Nortone\". The parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and is a Grade II* listed building. It dates from the early 12th century, with later renovations. A school was built in the village in 1876, and was originally called the Norton Board School. It became a primary school in the late 1940s, and was renamed the Norton County Primary School in the 1970s. In the 1980s it became the Norton Comprehensive School, a secondary school with a sixth form. The village has two Methodist churches, a Catholic church, and a meeting house for the Society of Friends. Norton is also the home of the Doncaster Plantworks, a large industrial plant owned by Vesuvius UK, which manufactures refractory products. The plant was built in the 1950s, and has been extended several times since then. Norton has a large village green, with a war memorial. There is also a smaller green, called Fennyfields, at the south-west edge of the village. According to the 2011 census, the population of the civil parish was 3,325.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 694021}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frogs in culture\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frogs play a variety of roles in culture, appearing in folklore and fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm story of The Frog Prince. In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, frogs symbolized fertility, while in classical antiquity, the Greeks and Romans associated frogs with fertility, harmony, and licentiousness.\n\nFrogs are the subjects of fables attributed to Aesop, of proverbs in various cultures, and of art. Frog characters such as Kermit the Frog and Pepe the Frog feature in popular culture. They are eaten in some parts of the world including France. In Australia, a fondant dessert is known as frog cake.\n\nHistory \nFolklorist Andrew Lang listed myths about a frog or toad that swallows or blocks the flow of waters occurring in many world mythologies.\n\nOn the other hand, researcher Anna Engelking drew attention to the fact that studies on Indo-European mythology and its language see \"a link between frogs and the underworld, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 sickness and death\".\n\nAncient Mesopotamia\nIn the Sumerian epic poem of Inanna and Enki, the goddess Inanna tricks Enki, the god of water, into giving her all of the sacred mes, prompting Enki to send various watery creatures to retrieve them. The first of these is a frog, whom Enki grasps \"by its right hand\". Frogs also appear as filling motifs on cylinder seals of the Kassite Period.\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nTo the Egyptians, the frog was a symbol of life and fertility, since millions of them were born after the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertility to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented fertility, named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, or a woman with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog on the end of a phallus to explicitly indicate her association with fertility. A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown in the form of a frog.\n\nTexts of the Late Period describe the Ogdoad of Hermepolis, a group of eight \"primeval\" gods, as having the heads of frogs (male) and serpents (female), and they are often depicted in this way in reliefs of the Greco-Roman period.\nThe god Nu in particular is sometimes depicted either with the head of a frog surmounted by a beetle.\n\nHapi was a deification of the annual flood of the Nile River, in Egyptian mythology, which deposited rich silt on the banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops. In Lower Egypt, he was adorned with papyrus plants, and attended by frogs, present in the region, and symbols of it.\n\nClassical antiquity \n\nThe Greeks and Romans associated frogs with fertility and harmony, and with licentiousness in association with Aphrodite. The combat between the Frogs and the Mice (Batrachomyomachia) was a mock epic, commonly attributed to Homer, though in fact a parody of his Iliad. The Frogs Who Desired a King is a fable, attributed to Aesop. The Frogs prayed to Zeus asking for a King. Zeus set up a log to be their monarch. The Frogs protested they wanted a fierce and terrible king, not a mere figurehead. So Zeus sent them a Stork to be their king. The new king hunted and devoured his subjects. Aesop wrote a fable about a frog trying to inflate itself to the size of an ox. Phaedrus (and later Jean de La Fontaine) wrote versions of this fable. The Frogs is a comic play by Aristophanes, in which the choir of frogs sings the famous onomatopoeic line: \"Brekekekex koax koax.\"\n\nIn the Bible, the Second Plague of Egypt described in the Book of Exodus 8:6 is of frogs. In the New Testament, frogs are associated with unclean spirits in Revelation 16:13.\n\nMedieval and Early Modern \n\nMedieval Christian tradition based on the Physiologus distinguished land frogs from water frogs representing righteous and sinful congregationists, respectively. In folk religion and occultism, the frog also became associated with witchcraft or as an ingredient for love potions.\n\nThe Japanese poet Matsuo Bash\u014d wrote one of his most famous haiku about a frog jumping into an old pond.\n\nIn folk and fairy tales\nThe frog is also a character in many fairy tales, be it tales from oral tradition or literary reworkings by later writers.\n\nThe frog or toad appears as a potential suitor to a female human in variants of the Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther type ATU 440, \"The Frog King\". The most famous is the story of The Frog Prince. It also appears as a female bride in tales of the ATU 402 type, \"The Animal Bride\", such as Puddocky (German fairy tale), The Frog Princess (Russian fairy tale) and The Three Feathers (German fairy tale).\n\nIt also acts as a helper of the heroes and heroines, such as in the beginning of the story of the Sleeping Beauty, and in French literary fairy tales The Benevolent Frog (by MMe. d'Aulnoy) and The Little Green Frog.\n\nIn Hans Christian Andersen's lengthy fairy tale \"The Marsh King's Daughter,\" a beautiful young woman is transformed, night after night, into a large, mournful frog.  With the first rays of dawn, she changes back to human form.\n\nThe toad appears as a transformation for the hero Jiraiya in the Japanese story The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya.\n\nThe frog appears in the form of a beautiful maiden, named Bheki, in a tale from Sanskrit legend. The amphibian, in this story, symbolizes the sun.\n\nIn modern culture\n\nProverbs and popular traditions\nThe \"frog in a well\" saying about having a narrow vision of life is found in Sanskrit (\"Kupa Manduka\", \u0915\u0941\u092a\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0921\u0941\u0915), in Bengali, \u0995\u09c1\u09aa\u09ae\u09a8\u09cd\u09a1\u09c1\u0995), in Vietnamese \"\u1ebech ng\u1ed3i \u0111\u00e1y gi\u1ebfng coi tr\u1eddi b\u1eb1ng vung\" (\"Sitting at the bottom of wells, frogs think that the sky is as wide as a lid\"), and in Malay \"Bagai katak dibawah tempurung\" (\"Like a frog under a coconut shell\").. The Chinese versions are   \"\u5750\u4e95\u89c0\u5929\" (\"sitting in the well, looking to the sky\") and \"\u4e95\u5e95\u4e4b\u86d9\" (\"a frog in a well\") from the Taoist classic Zhuangzi that has a frog living in an abandoned well, who talks about things big and small with the turtle of the Eastern Sea.\n\nOther frog proverbs include the American \"You can't tell by looking at a frog how high he will jump.\" and the Iranian \"When the snake gets old, the frog gets him by the balls.\"\n\nIn Chinese traditional culture, frog represents the lunar yin, and the Frog spirit Ch'ing-Wa Sheng is associated with healing and good fortune in business, although a frog in a well is symbolic of a person lacking in understanding and vision.\n\nThe supposed behavior of frogs illustrating nonaction is told in the often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, and it will not notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water as long as it was heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: \"If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot\u2014they don't sit still for you.\"\n\nThe short poem \"What a queer bird\", which appeared in magazines in the 1920s, is about the qualities of a frog from a bird's perspective.\n\nIn Finland, miniature wooden coffins containing frogs have been discovered under the floors of some churches, and in other places such as in a field, under a cowshed, in rapids, or in a hearth. They are thought to have been part of a practice of magic, or to protect against magic.\n\nAccording to researcher Anna Engelking, there is a certain naming taboo in Polish folk belief regarding calling a child a frog, since it may stump the child's growth. Hence, there is a verbal avoidance of mentioning the frog by its name, instead using an euphemism that denotes some trait (i.e, 'the one that jumps').\n\nIn art\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted frogs in their art. Painters of the Dutch Golden Age sometimes included frogs in their compositions; for example, Ambrosius Bosschaert II painted a vanitas still life Dead Frog with Flies c. 1630; in 2012, the artists Rob and Nick Carter created a silent digital version, lasting three hours, in which the \"still\" image \"slowly, imperceptibly\" changes with the movement of the sun, and occasionally an insect such as a dragonfly enters the scene.\n\nContemporary pop culture\n\nThe theme of transformation features prominently in popular culture, from The Frog Prince to fantasy settings such as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger video games with magic spells that turn people into frogs.\n\nMichigan J. Frog featured in a Warner Brothers cartoon. Kermit the Frog is the straight man character in Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.\n\nSeveral Pok\u00e9mon species are based on frogs and toads, such as the Poliwrath, Politoed, Seismitoad, and Greninja evolutionary families.\n\nTsuyu Asui/Froppy, a superhero with frog related powers, features in the manga and anime series My Hero Academia.\n\nPepe the Frog is a frog character from a webcomic which became a popular Internet meme, and was eventually appropriated as a symbol of the controversial alt-right movement.\n\nCuisine and confectionery\n\nFrogs are eaten, notably in France. One dish is known as cuisses de grenouille, frogs' legs, and although it is not especially common, it is taken as indicative of French cuisine. From this, \"frog\" has also developed into a common derogatory term for French people in English.\n\nFreddo Frog is a popular Australian chocolate, while frog cake is a Heritage Listed South Australian fondant dessert. Crunchy Frog is a fictitious confectionery from a Monty Python skit of the same name. Chocolate Frogs are a popular sweet in the Harry Potter universe.\n\nSee also\n Ethnoherpetology\n List of fictional frogs\n Salamanders in folklore and legend\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Vince-Pallua, Jelka. \"What Can the Mythical Frog Tell Us?

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Starfish and the Spider\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations is a 2006 book by Ori Brafman (author of the 2010 book Click: The Magic of Instant Connections) and Rod Beckstrom. It is an exploration of the implications of the rise of decentralized organizations such as Grokster and Wikipedia. The book contrasts them to centralized organizations, such as Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, using compendia of knowledge as examples. The spider and starfish analogy refers to the contrasting biological nature of the respective organisms, starfish having a decentralized neural structure permitting regeneration.\n\nIn addition to giving historical examples of decentralized organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous and the Apaches and analyzing their nature in contrast to centralized organizations, the book considers conflict between centralized and decentralized organizations, including the \"If you can't beat them, join them\" solution of creating hybrid organizations such as Citizendium. A chapter towards the end of the book explores the concept of the \"sweet spot\", the optimal mix of decentralized and centralized attributes.\n\nSummary\n\nDon Verelli was an attorney who championed the effort for MGM to crack down on the peer-to-peer music website Grokster. But although the record labels won the lawsuits, other groups such as Kazaa, and eMule surfaced. The authors compare the record companies to \"spiders\" \u2013 organizations under the control of a central brain or leader \u2013 while the smaller organizations are more like \"starfish\" \u2013 if a limb is severed, the remaining parts are able to regenerate the entire body, resulting in two or more starfish. The spider organization is compared to the Aztec Empire which fell when Montezuma was defeated by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his Spanish army, but the starfish organization is compared to the Apaches, who decentralized and became nomadic, and which the Spanish army could not defeat.\n\nDave Garrison of Netcom attempts to explain the Internet to executives in Paris, but is met with questions such as who would run the Internet. The authors look into the starfish Alcoholics Anonymous, which survives and thrives even away from the founder. They also look into the history of the music industry since the 19th century from live performers to recording on small labels to ownership from the big five record companies to Napster and other peer-to-peer networks. They list questions that determine whether an organization is more like a spider or a starfish. The authors discuss some founders of starfish organizations: Niklas Zennstrom and Skype; Craig Newmark and Craigslist. They discuss the formation of the Apache software model and how editors work on Wikipedia articles. They then discuss the starfish self-organization of participants in the Burning Man festival.\n\nEnglish lawyer Granville Sharp's decision to defend the freedom of a slave named Jonathan Strong leads him to connect with the Quakers and to advocate for the abolition of the slave trade. The authors use Sharp's story to illustrate five foundational principles called the Five Legs: 1) Circles; 2) The Catalyst; 3) Ideology; 4) The Preexisting Network; 5) The Champion. They apply the Five Legs to the story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton who served as a catalyst to the women's rights movement in the USA with Susan B. Anthony as the champion. They then focus on some examples of catalysts: Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia; Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, who worked for the city of San Francisco and later Goodwill; entrepreneur Auren Hoffman and Josh Sage. They list a set of catalyst's tools including: Genuine Interest in Others, Loose Connections, Mapping, Desire to Help, Meet People Where They Are, Emotional Intelligence, Trust, Inspiration, Tolerance for Ambiguity, Hands-Off Approach and Receding. They contrast the work of a catalyst with that of a CEO.\n\nUsing the Animal Liberation Front as an example of a decentralized group similar to Al-Qaeda, the authors suggest three strategies of dealing with decentralized groups: Changing Ideology (or introducing better competing ideologies), Centralizing Them (Cow Principle, what defeated the Apaches), and Decentralizing Yourself (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em) The authors suggest organization uses a hybrid model that blends both centralized and decentralized concepts, such as with eBay. They also cite other instances of hybrids such as Amazon.com letting volunteer reviewers contribute and Intuit having a TaxAlmanac website for people to help each other. The authors discuss Peter Drucker's assessment of General Motors's management process, how it led to Toyota taking over the auto industry, and how they later collaborated on the NUMMI plant. Similarly the iTunes model of pricing single songs has been a \"sweet spot\" for Apple and their online music store, and other companies are moving to an open-source model with their software.\n\nThe authors use a series of analogies throughout their book, summarizing their thoughts with Ten Rules: Diseconomies of scale, The network effect, The power of chaos, Knowledge at the edge, Everyone wants to contribute, Beware the hydra response, Catalysts rule, The values are the organization, Measure Monitor and Manage, and Flatten or be flattened.\n\nReception\n\nSee also \n Leaderless resistance\n Unorganisation\n The Cathedral and the Bazaar\n\nWorks cited \n The Starfish And the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations, Penguin (October 5, 2006), hardcover, 230 pages,\n\nReferences \n\n Originally adapted from the Wikinfo article The Starfish and the Spider\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2006 books\nOrganizational structure\nWorks about social movements\nCommunity building", "machine_text": " The Starfish and the Spider is a business book by Ralph Kimball and Joe Leppitt, published in 1998, discussing the management of data in a data warehouse. The authors compare the management of data in a data warehouse to a starfish, and the management of data in an operational system to a spider. The book discusses the differences between data in a data warehouse and data in an operational system. Data in a data warehouse is static, in that it is not expected to change, while data in an operational system is dynamic, in that it is expected to change frequently. Data in a data warehouse is aggregated, in that it is often summarized, while data in an operational system is detailed, in that it is not summarized. The book also discusses the different ways in which data can be stored in a data warehouse. Data can be stored in a normalized format, in which data is stored in a set of related tables. Data can also be stored in a denormalized format, in which data is stored in a single table. The authors argue that a denormalized format is often better for data warehouses, because it can be more efficient to retrieve data from a single table than from multiple tables.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8484001}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chaim Gross\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Chaim Gross (March 17, 1902 \u2013 May 5, 1991) was an American sculptor and educator.\n\nChildhood\nGross was born to a Jewish family in Austrian Galicia, in the village of Wolowa (now known as Mezhgorye, Ukraine), in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1911, his family moved to Kolomyia (which was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 and became part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991). During World War I, Russian forces invaded Austria-Hungary; amidst the turmoil, the Grosses fled Kolomyia. They returned when Austria retook the town in 1915, refugees of the war. When World War I ended, Gross and brother Avrom-Leib went to Budapest to join their older siblings Sarah and Pinkas.  Gross applied to and was accepted by the art academy in Budapest and studied under the painter B\u00e9la Uitz, though within a year a new regime under Mikl\u00f3s Horthy took over and attempted to expel all Jews and foreigners from the country.  After being deported from Hungary, Gross began art studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, Austria shortly before immigrating to the United States in 1921.\n\nEmigration from Austria to U.S.\nGross' brother Naftoli had arrived in New York City in 1914.  He sent money to his brothers Chaim and Avrom-Lieb, who traveled from Vienna to Le Havre, France, where they took a boat to New York City in March 1921.\n\nEarly Career 1921-1933\nGross's studies continued in the United States at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he studied with Elie Nadelman and others, and at the Art Students League of New York, with Robert Laurent.  He also attended the Educational Alliance Art School, studying under Abbo Ostrowsky, at the same time as Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Adolph Gottlieb, and Peter Blume.\n\nIn 1926, Gross began teaching at The Educational Alliance, and continued teaching there for the next 50 years.  Louise Nevelson was among his students at the Alliance (in 1934), during the time she was transitioning from painting to sculpture.\n\nGross began exhibiting sculpture in group shows of students at the Educational Alliance, and then at the Jewish Art Center in the Bronx. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he exhibited at the Salons of America exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and, beginning in 1928, at the Whitney Studio Club (the precursor to the Whitney Museum of American Art).\n\nIn 1929, Gross experimented with printmaking, and created an important group of 15 linocuts and lithographs of landscapes, New York City streets and parks, women in interiors, the circus, and vaudeville. The entire suite is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gross returned to the medium of printmaking in the 1960s, and produced approximately 200 works in the medium over the next two decades.\n\nIn March 1932, Gross had his first solo exhibition at Gallery 144 in New York City.  For a short time they represented Gross, as well as his friends Milton Avery, Moses Soyer, Ahron Ben-Shmuel and others.\n\nGross was primarily a practitioner of the direct carving method, with the majority of his work being carved from wood. Other direct carvers in early 20th-century American art include William Zorach, Jose de Creeft, and Robert Laurent. Works by Chaim Gross can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the United States, with substantial holdings (27 sculptures) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. A key work from this era, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is the 1932 birds-eye maple Acrobatic Performers,  which is also only one and one quarter inch thick. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\nMaturity 1933-1957\nIn 1933 Gross joined the government's PWAP (Public Works of Art Project), which transitioned into the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which Gross worked for later in the 1930s.  Under these programs Gross taught and demonstrated art, made sculptures that were placed in schools and public colleges, made work for Federal buildings including the Federal Trade Commission Building, and for the France Overseas and Finnish Buildings at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Gross was also recognized during these years with a silver medal at the Exposition universelle de 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, with a purchase prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Artists for Victory\" exhibition for his wood sculpture of famed circus performer Lillian Leitzel.\n\nIn 1938 filmmaker and historian Lewis Jacobs made a 30-minute feature of Gross carving, called Tree Trunk to Head, showing Gross at work in his East Village studio on a portrait of his wife Renee, who models in the film.\n\nIn 1949 Gross sketched Chaim Weizmann, President of Israel, at several functions in New York City where Weizmann was speaking.  Gross began a portrait in clay and then traveled to Israel in the summer of that year hoping to be able to meet Weizmann and have him sit for a portrait.  Weizmann was too ill, but Gross completed the bust in bronze later that year.  Gross returned to Israel for three months in 1951 (the second of many trips there in the postwar years) to paint a series of 40 watercolors of life in various cities. This series was exhibited at the Jewish Museum (Manhattan) in 1953.  \n \nChaim Gross, Sculptor by Josef Vincent Lombardo, the first major book on Gross, came out in 1949. It included a catalogue raisonne of his sculpture.\n\nIn the 1950s Gross began to make more bronze sculptures alongside his wood and stone pieces, and in 1957 and 1959 he traveled to Rome to work with famed bronze foundries including the Nicci foundry.  At the end of the decade Gross was working primarily in bronze, which allowed him to create open forms, large-scale works and of course, multiple casts. Gross's large-scale bronze The Family, donated to New York City in 1991 in honor of Mayor Ed Koch, and installed at the Bleecker Street Park at 11th street, is now a fixture of Greenwich Village.\n\nLater Career 1957-1991\n\nIn 1957, Gross published The Techniques of Wood Sculpture, an influential how-to book with photographs of him at work by famed photographer Eliot Elisofon. In 1959, a survey of Gross's sculpture in wood, stone, and bronze was featured in the exhibit Four American Expressionists curated by Lloyd Goodrich at the Whitney Museum of American Art, with work by Abraham Rattner, Doris Caesar, and Karl Knaths. In 1963, Gross and his family moved from their longtime residence at 30 W. 105th Street to Greenwich Village, following the purchase of a four-story historic townhouse and studio at 526 LaGuardia Place. The townhouse is now the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, winner of a 2015 Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and open to the public.\n\nIn 1974, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held the exhibition, Chaim Gross: Sculpture and Drawings, organized by Janet A. Flint, Smithsonian Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1976, a selection from Gross's important collection of historic African sculpture, formed since the late 1930s, was exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum in the show The Sculptor's Eye: The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross.\n\nIn 1977, Gross had three retrospective exhibitions: at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami, followed by the Montclair Art Museum; and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). The Jewish Museum's exhibition catalog featured an important essay on Gross by art historian and modern American sculpture specialist Roberta K. Tarbell, Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University.\n\nGross received multiple honorary doctorates in the 1970s and 80s: from Franklin and Marshall College (1970); Yeshiva University (1978); Adelphi University (1980); Hebrew Union College (1984); and Brooklyn College (1986). In 1979 Gross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1981. In 1984, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, with Jacob Lawrence and Lukas Foss. Gross died at Beth Israel Hospital in May 1991 and was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Queens, New York. In the fall of 1991, Allen Ginsberg gave an important tribute to Gross at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is published in their Proceedings. In 1994, Forum Gallery, which now represents the Chaim Gross estate, held a memorial exhibition featuring a sixty-year survey of Gross's work.\n\nTeaching\nGross was a professor of printmaking and sculpture at both the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research in New York City, as well as at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the MoMA art school, the Art Student's League and the New Art School (which Gross ran briefly with Alexander Dobkin, Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer).\n\nGross was a member of the New York Artists Equity Association and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. He was a founder and served as the first president of the Sculptors Guild.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932 Gross married Renee Nechin (d. 2005), and they had two children, Yehuda and Mimi.  Mimi Gross is a New York-based artist. She was married to the artist Red Grooms from 1963-1976.\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140620172948/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/gross/index.html\n\nReferences\n Brumm\u00e9, C.

Over It. is the indie rock solo project of the Chicago, Illinois-based musician Evan Thomas Weiss. It is considered one of the leading acts in the emo revival scene of the 2010s.\n\nHistory\nEvan Weiss grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. His first exposure to emo was hearing the band Sunny Day Real Estate in the seventh grade while browsing a record shop. He continued his interest in music through buying Jade Tree and Polyvinyl records and going to local shows in Philadelphia. In the \"fourth or fifth grade\", Weiss started, with school friends, the band J.A.R., which eventually became The Progress, garnering modest local success. The Progress released an album and two EPs before breaking up in 2008. The Progress later reunited sporadically to perform one-off live shows. He was unable to convince his bandmates to play in the band full-time. \n\nHe started a solo project under the moniker Into It. Over It.. He first released music through two unorthodox concept projects: 52 Weeks, entailing the writing, recording and release of one song each week for a year (later released as a compilation); and Twelve Towns, a 12-song project initially released over six separate splits with several different bands, in which each song was named after a town. In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest. \n\nIn June, Weiss released Into It. Over It.'s first studio album, Proper on No Sleep Records, produced by Ed Rose. In the last two months of the year, Into It. Over It. supported The Swellers on their European tour. In March and April the next year, Into It. Over It. supported The Wonder Years on the Glamour Kills Spring 2012 tour in the US. To promote the tour, a compilation showcasing the bands covering each others' songs with released. Into It. Over It.'s contribution was a cover of The Wonder Years's track \"Don't Let Me Cave In\". This was followed up in 2013 with Intersections, released on Triple Crown Records and on Big Scary Monsters in UK/Europe.\n\nIn January 2015, on a break from touring, Weiss and touring drummer Josh Sparks lived for a month in a secluded cabin in Craftsbury, Vermont, where they wrote the third Into It. Over It. album. Built for the specific purpose of allowing musicians to work in isolation, Weiss said of the location: \"We were an hour from the nearest gas station, an hour from the nearest grocery store. Totally isolated, 4ft of snow on the ground, negative 20 degrees outside. The whole thing was run on solar or generator power, so no phone, no internet.\" He and Sparks spent 13 hours a day writing music. After completing a solo tour alongside Kevin Devine and Laura Stevenson, a stint in the UK with Modern Baseball and several spring support dates for Minus the Bear, Weiss officially wrapped up touring for the Intersections album\u2014which by that time had consisted of \"well over 250 shows in a little over 15 countries\" since 2013\u2014to begin recording Into It .Over It.'s third studio album with John Vanderslice. Weiss and Sparks entered Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studio in June to record; Weiss recalled: \"We couldn't sweat the small stuff, you're not able to go in and tweak or micromanage little sections of the music. It helped me accept chaos in a way I couldn't before.\" Into It. Over It. continued to play shows into the end of 2015 after Weiss completed a tour with his side project Pet Symmetry in support of Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room and Jeff Rosenstock. Notable dates included Riot Fest Chicago, Weiss's solo set at The Fest, a tour in support of The Get Up Kids in December (with Weiss and Into It. Over It. touring member Rodrigo Palma playing bass for The Get Up Kids at one show), and The Promise Ring's New Year's Eve reunion show.\n\nInto It. Over It. first revealed the upcoming release of their third album Standards through an article on SPIN, a teaser on their Facebook page, and an interview with Noisey which was accompanied by a stream of the first song from the album, \"No EQ\". Standards was released on March 11, 2016, through Triple Crown Records, and the band toured the US in support of the album alongside The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die from March to May.\n\nRelated acts\nWeiss was a notably active figure in underground punk and emo music as far back as 2001, and played in numerous bands from Chicago as well as around his hometown of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He currently fronts Pet Symmetry with Erik Czaja and Marcus Nuccio of fellow emo band Dowsing, and also fronted Their / They're / There alongside Mike Kinsella of Owen and Matthew Frank of Loose Lips Sink Ships,. He plays bass in both bands despite having gained notoriety as a guitarist in Into. It Over It. Bass was the first instrument he learned and hence what he usually played.\n\nThe initial members of Into It. Over It.'s live band also formed a separate project named Stay Ahead of the Weather They released an EP in 2010 as well as a split with The Wonder Years No updates regarding the activities of the band came after May 2013. Weiss stated about the possibility of another album, \"probably not unfortunately. everyone is doing their own thing now[sic]\".\n\nHe was also previously a member of Damiera, and Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start, as well as a large number of much smaller bands from his high school years including Labour, Map the Growth, The Funeral Bird, Hiroshima Mon'Amour, Sleeper Agents, The French Connection, Emergency, and Forgive Her Choke Her.\n\nIn mid-2015, Into.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Thrice Woven\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Thrice Woven is the sixth studio album by American black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room. The album was released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label, Artemisia Records. The album was produced collaboratively with Randall Dunn and recorded primarily in their own recording studio Owl Lodge in Olympia, Washington, which the Weaver brothers built themselves, with the drums recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle. Thrice Woven received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release.\n\nBackground \nThrice Woven is the first black metal album by Wolves in the Throne Room since 2011's Celestial Lineage, which the band consider the final chapter in a trilogy of albums comprising Two Hunters, Black Cascade, and Celestial Lineage. The band regard their 2014 ambient album Celestite as being a companion piece to Celestial Lineage, rather than a successor, and have also stated categorically that Thrice Woven is not connected with the previous records; as a result, Thrice Woven can be considered the band's first 'true' album since 2011. It is also the first album recorded almost entirely in the band's home studio Owl Lodge, and is their first album to feature new permanent band-member Kody Keyworth on guitars and vocals.\n\nRecording, production \nThe album was recorded almost entirely at the band's home studio, Owl Lodge, in Olympia, Washington. The band recorded the drums at Litho Studio in Seattle with Jack Shirley. According to Aaron Weaver, \"Once we finished the drums, we brought the sessions back to our studio in Olympia, Randall Dunn showed up and we kind of made a plan on how to put the record together.\" He also explained that \"Me and Nathan would work by ourselves, tracking guitars, synthesizers, whatever then Randall would show up and kind of check it out and give suggestions. He tracked a lot of stuff too \u2014 he always plays a little bit of synthesizer on our records. Once all the tracking was wrapped up, we met up with Randall again in Seattle and mixed at Avast! Studio\". In a separate interview, Aaron Weaver explained that \"About halfway through recording, we realized it was time to invite Kody Keyworth to be a full member of the band. He'd been playing guitar on the road with us for six years. As we were recording Thrice Woven, we just realized that Kody's got to be on this record \u2014 he's a part of this band from now on.\" As a result, Keyworth \"added flavor to Thrice Woven but was uninvolved in the initial work on these songs.\"\n\nMusical style, writing \nThrice Woven has been described as significantly more aggressive and traditionally black metal than many of the band's previous albums, and both critics and the band themselves have noted the role of new guitarist Kody Keyworth in the album's sound. NPR Music wrote that the album's opening track \"recalls the WITTR of Two Hunters and Black Cascade, but is immediately bolder, with a newfound ferocity that feels untethered to the past.\" Decibel noted that the album \"is defined in a good deal of traditionalism, specifically second-wave black metal traditionalism.\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek likewise noted that \"Thrice Woven re-engages with blackness, full signature riffs, epic tunes, and tales of pagan nature worship that established Wolves in the Throne Room's identity. This is a return to the pummeling, multi-layered power that made 2009's Black Cascade a masterpiece.\"\n\nRelease, promotion, marketing \nWolves in the Throne Room announced the initial details (including the track listing, release date, and album cover) of Thrice Woven on June 28, 2017, along with a brief teaser trailer. On July 17, the band premiered their first ever music video for the song \"Born from the Serpent's Eye\", featuring the first half of the nearly 10-minute piece. According to the band, \"We lit a bonfire and blasted through the first third of our song Born From The Serpent\u2019s Eye. [sic] This is the first time we\u2019d played the song with new guitarist Kody Keyworth and it fucking slayed. Peter and Nico captured the magic. May the good fires blaze!\u201d On August 21 the band premiered the song \"Angrboda\" in full as part of Adult Swim's Singles 2017 series. On September 11, they also premiered the song \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean\" as a companion piece to the previously released \"Angrboda\". The album was officially released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label Artemisia Records.\n\nTouring \nThe band have announced they will tour the United States throughout Fall 2017 with Pillorian from September 29 to October 25. They have also announced a European tour from November 15 to December 15, 2017 with support from Aluk Todolo and Wiegedood.\n\nCritical reception \n\nThrice Woven was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCritics generally noted the considerably more aggressive and traditionally black metal approach of the album, particularly compared to the band's previous records. The A.V. Club wrote that \"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band\u2019s live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld\", but noting that \"this being a WITTR record, the fury comes in crashing waves, emerging monstrously from stretches of placid calm\" Decibel named the album 'Best New Noise' and praised Thrice Woven as \"a return to the glories of old\", highlighting the strength of the songwriting in particular.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nWolves in the Throne Room \n Nathan Weaver \u2014 vocals, guitars\n Aaron Weaver \u2014 drums, synthesizers\n Kody Keyworth \u2014 guitars, vocals\n\nAdditional musicians \n Don McGreey \u2014 acoustic guitar (on track 1)\n Steve Von Till \u2014 vocals, acoustic guitar (on track 2)\n Anna Von Hausswolff \u2014 vocals (on tracks 1 and 4)\n Phil Petrocelli \u2014 percussion (on track 4)\n Zeynep Oyku Yilmaz \u2014 grand harp (on track 4)\n\nTechnical and additional personnel \n Randall Dunn \u2014 production, engineering\n Jason Ward \u2014 mastering\n Jack Shirley \u2014 engineering\n William Smith \u2014 additional engineering\n Denis Forkas Kostromitin \u2014 artwork\n John Westrock \u2014 photography\n\nReferences \n\n2017 albums\nWolves in the Throne Room albums\nBlack metal albums by American artists", "machine_text": " Thrice Woven Thrice Woven is an American doom metal band from Minneapolis, Minnesota, formed in 2012.

These two gods are now worshipped together under Ngewo, with Leve considered as his consort. Ngewo is a sky god, responsible for creating the universe, and is in charge of determining earth\u2019s natural phenomena. He is popularly depicted as a distant deity, who does not concern himself with the day-to-day goings of his worshippers. However, in certain myths, Ngewo tends to punish those who forget to pray to him as well as those who do not pay tribute to him. He communicates with the Mende people through the help of their ancestors\u2019 spirits, dyinyinga, who also demand certain food offerings.\n\nLegends\n\nCreation of the first human \nNgewo originally lived alone on earth in a cave. One day, he wanted company, so he started creating animals, in a female-male pair. Eventually, he created the first man and the first woman. Ngewo gave his creations freedom to ask him of anything, which backfired after a while. He was overwhelmed with their requests and retreated to the heavens, where he had lived since then.\n\nOrigin of death \nNgewo gave two messages to be received by the Mende people and told two animals, the toad and the dog, to send these messages to earth. The dog was entrusted with telling humans that they will not die, while the toad would bring a message foretelling their death instead. Unfortunately, the toad arrived first, since the dog was distracted. Thus, death became humanity\u2019s fate.\n\nSee also \n\n List of African mythological figures\n\nReferences \n\nAfrican gods\nCreator deities\nAfrican mythology", "machine_text": " Ngewo (Bini: \u1eb9\u0300w\u00f3) is an African traditional religion and the traditional belief system of the Edo people of Nigeria.

They believe that humans can use these energies to bring about good or evil. The Edo people believe that Ngewo is a loving and just god who is concerned with the well-being of humans. They believe that he is a personal god who can be communicated with directly by individuals. They believe that he is a god of creation and that he has the power to create and sustain life.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harry Markopolos\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harry M. Markopolos (born October 22, 1956) is an American former securities industry executive and a forensic accounting and financial fraud investigator.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2008, Markopolos uncovered evidence that suggested that Bernie Madoff's wealth management business was a huge Ponzi scheme. In 2000, 2001, and 2005, Markopolos alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of his views, supplying supporting documents, but each time the SEC ignored him or gave his evidence only a cursory investigation. Madoff was finally revealed to be a fraud in December 2008, when his sons contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After admitting to operating the largest private Ponzi scheme in history, Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison.\n\nIn 2010, Markopolos' book on uncovering the Madoff fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller, was published. Markopolos has criticized the SEC for failing to discover the Madoff fraud despite repeated tips, and for failing to investigate properly the larger companies it supervised. Critics of Markopolos have called him obsessive, a self-publicist, and self-righteous, and some questioned whether he was motivated by a financial bounty, which he denied.\n\nEducation and career \n\nMarkopolos attended Roman Catholic schools, graduating from Cathedral Preparatory School in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1974. He received an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loyola College in Maryland in 1981, and a Master of Science in Finance from Boston College in 1997.\nHe is a CFA charterholder, and a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE).\n\nHe began his career on Wall Street in 1987 as a broker with Makefield Securities, a small Erie-based brokerage. In 1988, he obtained a job with Darien Capital Management in Darien, Connecticut, as an assistant portfolio manager.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2004, he served as a portfolio manager at Boston-based options trading company Rampart Investment Management, ultimately becoming its chief investment officer.\n\nHe now works as a forensic accounting analyst for attorneys who sue companies under the False Claims Act and other laws, emphasizing tips that result in continuing investigations into medical billing, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Defense frauds, in which a \"whistleblower\" would be compensated.\n\nMadoff investigation \n\nDuring 1999, Markopolos learned that one of Rampart's frequent trading partners, Access International Advisors, was dealing with a hedge fund manager who consistently delivered net returns of 1% to 2% a month.\n\nFrank Casey, one of Rampart's principals, met with Access CEO Ren\u00e9-Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet, and learned the manager was Bernie Madoff, who was operating a wealth management business in which his clients essentially gave him carte blanche to invest the money as he saw fit, in a set of securities. Casey and Rampart's managing partner, Dave Fraley, asked Markopolos to try to design a product similar to Madoff's split-strike conversion, in hopes of luring away Access from investing in Madoff.\n\nWhen Markopolos obtained a copy of Madoff's revenue stream, he spotted problems. The biggest red flag, he believed, was that the return stream rose steadily with only a few downticks\u00a0\u2013 represented graphically by a nearly perfect 45-degree angle. According to Markopolos, anyone who understood the underlying math of the markets would have known that such a return stream \"simply doesn't exist in finance,\" since the markets were too volatile even in the most favorable conditions for this to be possible. Based on this and other factors, Markopolos eventually concluded that Madoff could not mathematically deliver his purported returns using the strategies he claimed to use. As he saw it, there were only two ways to explain the figures: Madoff was either running a Ponzi scheme (by paying established clients with newer clients' money) or front running (buying stock for his own and the hedge fund's accounts, based on insider knowledge about market impacts from about-to-be-executed client orders at his company's unrelated broker-dealer business).\n\nMarkopolos later said that he knew within five minutes that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. He claimed it took him another four hours to uncover enough evidence that he could mathematically prove that they could have been obtained only by fraud.\n\nDespite this, Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked Markopolos to deconstruct Madoff's strategy to see if he could replicate it. He could not simulate Madoff's returns, using information he had gathered about Madoff's trades in stocks and options. For instance, he discovered that for Madoff's strategy to work, he would have had to buy more options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange than actually existed.\n\nHis calculations of Madoff's trades revealed that there was almost no correlation between Madoff's stocks and the S&P 100, as Madoff claimed. Markopolos also could find no evidence that the market was responding to any Madoff trades, even though by his estimate Madoff was managing as much as $6 billion, three times more than any known hedge fund at the time. Given that Madoff's supposed trades should have had a substantial ripple effect on broader markets, Markopolos suspected that Madoff wasn't even trading.\n\nWith the help of two of his colleagues at Rampart, Casey and fellow quant Neil Chelo, Markopolos continued to probe the Madoff operation. What they found concerned him enough that he filed a formal complaint with the Boston office of the SEC during the spring of 2000. However, the SEC took no action. Nonetheless, others in the investing world took Markopolos' findings seriously. In 2000, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments dropped his plans to study Madoff's strategies after a meeting with Markopolos. Tillinghast wrote years later that his discussion with Markopolos convinced him that Madoff was almost certainly engaging in fraud; as he put it, \"nothing in Madoff's ostensible strategy made sense.\"\n\nMichael Ocrant, editor-in-chief of MARHedge, joined the effort to publicize Madoff's questionable actions. Casey surprised Ocrant with information that Madoff, whom Ocrant only knew to be one of the largest market makers on NASDAQ and one of the largest brokers on the New York Stock Exchange, actually ran a secretive multi-billion dollar hedge fund, directly managing investors' money. Ocrant investigated and wrote an article, \"Madoff tops charts; skeptics ask how\", published May 1, 2001, questioning Madoff's returns. Within a week, Erin Arvedlund followed with an investigative article in Barron's, further questioning Madoff's secrecy and results; despite the details in these scathing articles, they generated no action from the SEC, and did not scare off Madoff's existing investors.\n\nMarkopolos sent a more detailed submission to the SEC a year later. He also offered to let the SEC send him to Madoff's headquarters undercover, obtain the trading tickets, and compare them with the Options Price Reporting Authority tape. By then, Markopolos was convinced that Madoff was not really trading. He believed that his trading tickets would not match the OPRA tape, which would have been hard proof that Madoff was a fraud. This submission also passed without action from the SEC.\n\nFrom the beginning, Markopolos believed that Madoff was most likely running a Ponzi scheme, given his voracious appetite for cash; a Ponzi scheme can last only as long as new money is flowing in to pay existing investors. His colleagues, Casey and Chelo, were more inclined to think that Madoff was front running. Casey and Chelo believed Madoff was already a very wealthy man, and on paper it made no sense for him essentially to steal billions of dollars that he didn't need. They suspected that it was more feasible for him to increase his returns on actual trades via front-running. Markopolos, however, doubted this, since front-runners don't need the massive amount of new investor money that Madoff kept bringing in. Additionally, Markopolos believed that if Madoff was front-running, he would have to siphon off money from his broker-dealer arm to pay the investors in his hedge fund. This would have resulted in the customers of his broker-dealer operation getting shortchanged \u2014 something that would not have gone unnoticed by Madoff's more sophisticated broker-dealer customers.\n\nSoon after his second submission, Markopolos traveled to Europe with Magon de La Villehuchet to help get investors for an alternative product to Madoff that he'd developed for Rampart. While in Europe, Markopolos found that 14 different funds, at various firms, were invested with Madoff. Each manager believed that his fund was the only one from which Madoff was taking new money, a classic \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\" scenario. When Markopolos heard this, he was convinced that Madoff's wealth-management business was a Ponzi scheme.\n\nMarkopolos persevered, even though he felt that it created a considerable risk to his own safety. He learned during his European tour that a large number of funds invested with Madoff operated offshore. To his mind, this was evidence that the Russian mafia and Latin-American drug cartels were invested with  Madoff, and might want to silence anyone who threatened the viability of the hedge funds.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, Markopolos came up with a plan to deliver an investigative file anonymously to an aide of then Attorney General of New York Eliot Spitzer as Spitzer delivered a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. He put on a pair of white gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints, and wore an oversize coat.\n\nEven after leaving Rampart in 2004, frustrated that he was in a business that had to compete with cheats and lawbreakers, Markopolos continued to be driven by the intellectual challenge of solving the problem, and the ongoing encouragement from Boston SEC staffer Ed Manion. The culmination of Markopolos' analysis was a 21-page memo sent during November 2005 to SEC regulators, entitled \"The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud\". It outlined his suspicions in more detail and invited officials to check his theories. He outlined 30 red flags that he believed proved Madoff's returns could not be legitimate. His analysis was based on more than 14 years of Madoff return numbers, during which time Madoff reported only four losing months, an implausible scenario that Markopolos said could be achieved only by fraud. In the document Markopolos states:\n\nAlthough Madoff's scheme did not collapse until 2008, Markopolos believed that Madoff was on the brink of insolvency as early as the summer of 2005, when Casey found out that at least two banks were no longer lending money to their clients to invest with Madoff. This prompted Madoff to seek loans from banks. In June 2008\u00a0\u2013 six months before Madoff's scheme imploded\u00a0\u2013 Markopolos' team uncovered evidence that Madoff was accepting leveraged money. In his book, Markopolos wrote that this was a sign Madoff was running out of cash and needed to increase his intake of new funds to keep the scheme going.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Markopolos told a conference at Boston College, his alma mater, that he believed Madoff personally kept less than 1 percent of the $65 billion reported stolen, and would probably lose what remained of his portion to money launderers. Markopolos estimated that $35 billion to $55 billion of the money Madoff claimed to have stolen never really existed, but were simply fictional profits he reported to his clients. Markopolos believed that Madoff's customers lost $10 billion to $35 billion, most of which went to early investors. \"Madoff will wind up in a special prison designed as much to keep the crook's victims out as Madoff in. He's a guy who can't afford not to be in prison,\" he said. Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet committed suicide soon after Madoff's scheme collapsed, having lost $1.5 billion of his own and clients' money.\n\nCongressional testimony \nOn February 4, 2009, Markopolos testified before the United States Congress' House Financial Services Committee's capital markets panel and on March 1, appeared on CBS's 60 Minutes.\n\nMarkopolos harshly criticized the SEC for ignoring his warnings about Madoff. \"Nothing was done. There was an abject failure by the regulatory agencies we entrust as our watchdog,\" he said in 65 pages of prepared testimony. He said that his original 2000 complaint gave the SEC enough evidence to stop Madoff when he was supposedly managing as little as $3 billion.\n\nDescribing Madoff as \"one of the most powerful men on Wall Street,\" Markopolos stated that there was \"great danger\" in investigating him: \"My team and I surmised that if Mr. Madoff gained knowledge of our activities, he may feel threatened enough to seek to stifle us.\" He testified that he feared for his, as well as his family's safety, until after Madoff's arrest, when the SEC finally acknowledged that it had received \"credible evidence\" of Madoff's Ponzi scheme years before. He said that Madoff's \"math never made sense,\" that his \"return stream never resembled any known financial instrument or strategy,\" and that Madoff wasn't making the volumes of trades he claimed. According to Markopolos, the best warning about Madoff came during his initial analysis of 87 months (a little more than seven years) of Madoff trades. During that time, Madoff reported only three losing months. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index reported 28 losing months during the same period. He likened Madoff's purported returns to a baseball player batting .966 for the season and \"no one suspecting a cheat\".\n\nMarkopolos had originally concealed his identity from SEC regulators during May 1999, although he did meet face-to-face with SEC officials in Boston during 2000 and 2001. After the SEC did not respond, Markopolos was fearful of taking his complaints to the industry's self-regulatory authority, the National Association of Securities Dealers (since succeeded by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)).\n\nHe not only feared the power of Madoff's brother, Peter, had in that organization (he is a former Vice Chairman), but also feared that Madoff might have had associations with Russian and South American organized crime. Markopolos believed the FBI would reject his allegations without the SEC staff's endorsement. He believed that only a few SEC officials, including Manion and SEC Boston branch chief Mike Garrity, understood Madoff's operation well enough to detect the fraud. Markopolos met with Garrity during 2005, and said that while Garrity realized almost immediately that Madoff was violating the law, he could not take any action because Madoff was not based in New England.\n\nMarkopolos later wrote that a few days after that meeting, Garrity called him and said his preliminary investigation revealed serious irregularities in the Madoff operation, and that he would have had inspection teams \"tearing the place apart\" if Madoff had been based in New England. However, since the Boston office's jurisdiction extended only as far as Greenwich, Connecticut; Garrity had no choice but to pass it down to the New York office. \"My experiences with other SEC officials proved to be a systemic disappointment and led me to conclude that the SEC securities lawyers, if only through their investigative ineptitude and financial illiteracy, colluded to maintain large frauds such as the one to which Madoff later confessed.\"\n\nHe also added that during 2005 it was Meaghan Cheung, the branch chief of the SEC's New York office, to whom he gave his 21-page report alleging that Madoff was paying old investors with money from fresh recruits. \"Ms. Cheung never expressed even the slightest interest in asking me questions\", Markopolos said, claiming she was too concerned with Markopolos mentioning the possibility of a reward and the fact that he was a competitor of Madoff. Cheung approved an internal memo during November 2007 to close an SEC investigation of Madoff without bringing any claim. Subsequently, she left the agency. He testified he gave details about the case during 2005 to John Wilke, an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, but that it was never pursued. Markopolos testified he (anonymously) sent a package of documents concerning Madoff to former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had successfully prosecuted a number of securities fraud cases, but that Spitzer apparently did not act, either. Spitzer's family firm had invested in Madoff's business.\n\n\"Government has coddled, accepted, and ignored white-collar crime for too long,\" he testified. \"It is time the nation woke up and realized that it's not the armed robbers or drug dealers who cause the most economic harm, it's the white collar criminals living in the most expensive homes who have the most impressive resumes who harm us the most. They steal our pensions, bankrupt our companies, and destroy thousands of jobs, ruining countless lives.\" He testified to Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-NY) that he had never been compensated for his efforts. \"I did it for our flag, for patriotism.\" Markopolos presented recommendations to improve the SEC's operations, which included mandatory department standards: good ethics, full transparency, full disclosure, and fair dealing for all. The SEC must establish a unit to accept \"whistleblower\" tips, and move its activity closer to financial centers away from Washington, D.C.\n\nHis testimony included a reference to another $1 billion Ponzi scheme, which he shared the next day with SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, who gave the tips to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. He disclosed information regarding a dozen as-yet-unknown foreign Madoff feeder funds, \"hiding in the weeds\" in Europe, the victims of which likely included Russian mafia and drug cartels, \"dirty money\" investors. Markopolos remarked that European royal families had also lost assets.\n\nBecause of concerns of improper conduct by Inspector General Kotz in the Madoff investigation, Inspector General David C. Williams of the United States Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review. The Williams Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was a \"very good friend\" with Markopolos. Investigators were not able to determine when Kotz and Markopolos became friends. A violation of the ethics rule would have taken place if the friendship had been concurrent with Kotz's investigation of Madoff.\n\nOther statements \nIn his interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes, Markopolos said the biggest warning he noticed during his initial 1999 analysis of Madoff was that he reported losing months only four percent of the time. To Markopolos' mind, no one could possibly be that good, given the volatility of the markets. \"As we know, markets go up and down, and his only went up,\" he said. Markopolos noted that during his tenure at Rampart, he traded with some of the biggest derivatives companies in the world, and none of them dealt with Madoff, because they didn't think his numbers were real. He admitted that he had some financial incentive to eliminate Madoff, as the two competed against each other from 2000 to 2004. However, he said, he felt compelled to pursue it, because \"when someone's competing on your playing field, who's a dirty player, you want him tossed off the field.\" He assailed the SEC once again for ignoring his warnings, saying that the only reason Madoff was caught was that he ultimately collapsed under the weight of his own lies.\n\nMarkopolos expanded on his criticism of the SEC in No One Would Listen. He claimed that SEC regulators don't have nearly enough expertise to understand the various products offered in the modern market; as he put it, the SEC was still \"panning by hand\". He also believed that the SEC's enforcement staff didn't take his complaints seriously, because they were expecting legal proof Madoff was a fraud, not the mathematical evidence he provided. To his mind, the investigators didn't understand that mathematical proof was stronger evidence than legal proof, because \"with a math problem, there is only one correct answer.\"\n\nAs a result of the Madoff scandal, the SEC's chairman Christopher Cox stated that an investigation will delve into \"all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm.\"\n\n2019 General Electric fraud allegation \nIn 2019, Markopolos published a report alleging fraudulent accounting within General Electric. The report caused the company's stock to drop 10.3% on August 15, 2019. The stock closed at $9.03 prior to the report, and then closed at $8.01 the following day when the report was published.  Markopolos claimed GE was a fraud \"bigger than Enron.\" Subsequently, GE called the report \"meritless\" and an attempt at \"market manipulation\" by Markopolos; Wall Street analysts shrugged off the report; and the regulators called the report \"fairly simplistic.\"  A Financial Times article labeled the report \"some ill-thought out twaddle disguised as deep financial analysis.\" The Markopolos website (www.gefraud.com) alleging this giant fraud disappeared after criticism about the quality of his analyses.  The full report is still available, however, in internet archives. Three months after the 175 page Markopolos report, GE stock had risen almost 44% to close at $11.52 on November 15, outperforming the general stock market.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg in November 2021, \"For GE, the never-ending storm may pass, but at the moment, its future looks cloudy.\"\n\nPersonal life \nMarkopolos is the eldest of three children of Georgia and Louis Markopolos, Greek-American restaurateurs.\n\nHis father and two uncles once owned 12 Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips restaurants in Maryland and Delaware. His younger brother, Louie, once managed the trading office for a New Jersey brokerage company. He has a sister, Melissa.\n\nHe and his wife Faith, who works in the financial industry for an investment company conducting due diligence of portfolio managers, have three sons, two of whom\u200a\u2060 \u2013 Harry \"Hare Bear\" Markopolos and Louis \"Big Lou\" Markopolos\u200a\u2060 \u2013 are twins.\n\nBibliography \nMarkopolos's account of the Madoff scandal was published in book titled, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller. The book was released in 2010.\n\nFilmography \nChasing Madoff, a documentary film based on the book was released in 2011.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Markopolos interview (mp3) King World News (May 29, 2009).

He is best known for bringing to light the largest Ponzi scheme in American history, that of Bernie Madoff, in 2008. Markopolos worked on Wall Street for 20 years, including as a portfolio manager for a Boston-based hedge fund, for which he was the primary investment officer. In 2000, while investigating the investment portfolio of a client, he discovered what he claimed were \"consistent, persistent and overwhelming\" red flags that the client, Bernie Madoff, was engaged in securities fraud. Over the next eight years, Markopolos tried to alert the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to what he believed was Madoff's fraud, but the SEC did not act on his warnings. In 2008, Markopolos's investment fund, entrusted with $700 million, suffered massive losses as a result of the financial crisis, and he was forced to liquidate it. With the help of his attorney, David Mariss, he then sent a detailed letter to the SEC that included a description of the alleged fraud, as well as a list of questions he wanted the SEC to ask Madoff. Instead of investigating Madoff, the SEC investigated Markopolos, and, in 2009, charged him with securities fraud, alleging that he had tried to defraud the agency by falsely alleging fraud on the part of Madoff. The SEC settled its case with Markopolos in 2012, and he is now a whistleblower for the SEC. In 2010, Markopolos provided the first testimony to Congress concerning the causes of the financial crisis, specifically with respect to the role of the SEC. In his testimony, he claimed that the SEC had failed in its mission to protect investors, and that it was \"broken, inefficient, and poorly managed\". In 2013, Markopolos published a book about his experience trying to expose Madoff's fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller. In 2014, the story of Markopolos's detection of the Madoff fraud was adapted into a television movie, The Wizard of Lies, starring Robert De Niro as Madoff and Markopolos. In 2015, Markopolos was featured in the documentary film The Madoff Tapes. In 2016, Markopolos was featured in the documentary film The Big Short, about the financial crisis, where he was interviewed about his experiences investigating the mortgage-backed securities market.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20800581}

Given a linear programming problem, the fundamental theorem states that the objective function can be written in the form max c'x where c is a vector of constants and x is a vector of variables, and the constraints can be written in the form ax = b where a is a vector of constants, x is a vector of variables, and b is a vector of constants. The fundamental theorem is useful because it shows that any linear programming problem can be reduced to a trivial problem of this form, so that any linear programming algorithm that works for this trivial problem will also work for the original problem. The proof of the fundamental theorem is an important example of an application of the theory of duality in linear programming. The fundamental theorem can be stated as a corollary of the following two theorems. The first theorem is that any linear programming problem can be recast in the standard form. The second theorem is the so-called primal-dual theorem, which is a basic result in linear programming that shows that every linear programming problem can be recast as a primal-dual problem, where the primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem. The fundamental theorem is a corollary of these two theorems because the objective function in the fundamental theorem is the shadow price of the dual problem, and the constraints in the fundamental theorem are the constraints of the primal problem. The standard form of a linear programming problem is a form in which the problem is expressed using only the variables x and the constants a and b. In this form, the linear programming problem is to maximize a linear function c'x subject to the constraints ax = b and x >= 0. Here, c is a vector of constants (which will be used later), a is a vector of constants, b is a vector of constants, and x is a vector of variables. The primal-dual theorem states that for any linear programming problem, there exists a primal problem and a dual problem such that the primal-dual problem is equivalent to the original linear programming problem. The primal problem is the original problem and the dual problem is a trivial problem in which the objective function is the shadow price of the primal problem.

The Kagayanen language has a rich oral tradition. One of its most distinctive features is its use of \"clitics\", words that are used to modify other words without changing the word's stress. Kagayanen also has a complex system of register and pitch, which is used to convey emphasis or information about the relative status of the speakers. The Kagayanen language has been in use since before the Philippines was colonized by the Spanish.

He attended the City College of New York from 1925 to 1927, and received his medical degree from the College of Medicine at the University of Michigan in 1931. He completed his residency at the Eye and Ear Hospital in New York City. He then became a fellow at the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an associate at the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 1938, Harawitz joined the faculty at the University of Michigan as an assistant professor of ophthalmology. He became a full professor in 1945, and served as the chairman of the ophthalmology department from 1952 to 1965. In 1952, while at the University of Michigan, Harawitz began a research project to study the effects of light on the retina. He discovered that the retina contains two types of cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to light and that the cones are responsible for color vision. He also discovered that the rods are more sensitive to motion and that the cones are more sensitive to detail. Based on this research, Harawitz developed the double-striping of the yellow traffic lights. He proposed that the double-striping would make the lights more visible to color-blind people, and would also make the lights more effective at communicating information about the speed of oncoming traffic. In addition to the double-striping of the yellow traffic lights, Harawitz also developed the first electronic ophthalmoscope, the first automated refractometer, and the first automated tonometer. He also developed the first effective treatment for retinopathy of prematurity, a condition that can cause blindness in premature infants.

Bob attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles where he was on the league-champion tennis team and was graduated in 1944.  Upon graduation, he enlisted in the navy. His unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Bronze Star for bravery for a multi-ship raid into Tokyo Bay.  He was demoted from Signalman 3rd class to Seaman 1st class when his commanding officer told him to hop to it and Bob proceeded to jump up and down on the deck of the USS Brush. At the train station in Atwater Village (Glendale), upon his return from the South Pacific theater, he saw the coffins of many of his classmates from Marshall High who had died, and did not live to see a world without war. When the war ended, he attended Los Angeles City College and then the University of Arizona on the GI bill. A radio program director from WHB in Kansas City heard Arbogast's nighttime show on the university's radio station and hired him immediately.\n\nCareer\nBob went to Chicago's WMAQ where he worked with Pete Robinson from 1951 to 1953 (using as a theme song a charming version of Sicilian Tarantella played on an ocarina) before moving to Los Angeles for a time, then returning to Illinois where he worked at WEAW in Evanston, Illinois. Then he went to New York where he wrote for two shows, one featuring Tom Poston and another Peter Marshall. Then he worked at San Francisco's KSFO and KFRC. He later worked at many stations in Los Angeles including KMPC from 1962 to 1967, KLAC in 1967, KFI in 1968, and KGBS in 1969.\n\nAt KMPC, he wrote for Dick Whittinghill and Gary Owens, and he wrote with and was the partner of Jack Margolis at KLAC and KGBS.  Their radio talk show at KLAC had the highest rating of any radio program in LA history up until that time (and perhaps still), with a 14.5 percent share of the audience.  Due to a concentrated letter-writing campaign, they were fired for their objection to the Vietnam war and their pro-choice stance.  They may have been among the last fired due to the McCarthy dealings of the 1950s.  The pair also hosted a TV show on KTTV for a while.\n\nArbogast created the Question Man in Kansas City in 1951 and used it on the Poston Show in NY. It was later a feature on The Steve Allen Show, to the surprise of Bob and Steve - as Allen acknowledged in his book, The Question Man.  The concept lived on in Johnny Carson's Carnac the Magnificent and Jeopardy!.\n\nIn 1958, Arbogast teamed with Stanley Ralph Ross to write and perform the hit 45 rpm single \"Chaos, Parts 1 and 2,\" which when it came out (on Liberty Records #55197), sold 10,000 copies in three days, and then was banned from radio play on the fourth day - when stations realized that it satirized \"Top 40\" radio.  Dr. Demento has kept \"Chaos\" alive. In addition, they co-wrote the album of parody songs titled My Son, the Copycat (a take on Allan Sherman's albums) and the book Speak When You Hear the Beep.\n \nArbogast had numerous screen credits for cartoons and commercials and had appeared on television shows and in movies. He did frequent uncredited voiceovers for Sesame Street segments. He was the voice for the original \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\" advertising campaign and of the animated Granny Goose for the Granny Goose potato chip campaign (What is Granny's secret?  I won't say...\") Among hundreds, Arbogast is perhaps most famous for his voicings of General G.I. Brassbottom, Noodles Romanoff, and Ma Ramjet in the Roger Ramjet cartoon, Jack Wheeler in the Hot Wheels cartoon, and Snogs on the Hanna-Barbera animated series Monchhichis. He also voiced several characters in the Hanna-Barbera series The Jetsons. Not to be forgotten were Arbo's stylings of Barry Bear and Drummy Drummer, popular seventies pull-string toys - \"I'm Barry Bear, like to meet my paw?\"  \"I'm Drummy Drummer.  I went to school at the school of hard knocks.\" - and his renditions of hamburgers in early McDonald's commercials. While in elementary school at Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles, his son John was scolded when asked by his teacher, Mrs. Horowitz, what his father does for a living. John replied, \"he is a bear.\" Refusing to recant, a meeting with the teacher, principal, and Bob resulted in free hot dogs on \"Hot Dog Wednesday\" for John for a year. John also has many voices still running on Sesame Street.  In 1966 he appeared in the campy horror film \"Batwoman\".\n\nOne of his most popular bits was his portrayal of little old lady Emily Norton for KMPC.\n\nAmong his many TV and radio commercial partners were Pat Harrington, Harry Morgan, Doris Roberts, Joan Gerber, Edie McClurg, Bob Elliott, Albert Brooks, Shelley Berman, Tim Conway, Lorenzo Music, Gene Moss and Casey Kasem.\n\nArbogast won an Emmy as a writer for Stars of Jazz in 1958 and a Clio in the '70's, for the Highland Appliance Co. of Detroit. He wrote for Sesame Street and The Pat Paulsen Show. He also has the dubious distinction of writing for the shortest-lived television show ever, Turn-On, which was canceled after one night because it satirized, among others, the Pope. He co-starred (had two lines and 6 minutes on camera) with Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in the motion picture The Falcon and the Snowman and he drove the bus in Linda Lovelace for President.\n\nArbogast was a jazz aficionado, Chicago Cubs and UCLA Bruins fan, and animal lover.  He and his wife, Jan, lived in Mariposa, California, tending to their garden, caring for their pets, and the pleasures of the internet, satellite radio and television.  With his previous wife, Joanna, he raised a daughter and three sons. His oldest son Peter is the radio voice of USC Trojan football. His middle son John is a USC honors grad, a decorated Coast Guard officer, retired Los Angeles city park ranger, history teacher, city champion pole vault coach and assistant track and field coach at John Marshall High School. His youngest son Jerry is a UCLA graduate and a retired physical education teacher and tennis coach in the Los Angeles Unified School District. His daughter Paula retired in June 2006 from her position as a teachers' union representative. With his first wife, Tobi, he had a son, Robert Jr. (Ted), an accomplished musical director and band leader, and the technology coordinator for Terlingua High School in Texas. Bob is also survived by six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Listen to Chaos (KAOS Radio)\n 1953 Arbogast Show\n \n\n1927 births\n2009 deaths\nAmerican talk radio hosts\nAmerican male voice actors\nAmerican male radio actors\nAmerican television writers\nAmerican male television writers\nEmmy Award winners\nClio Award winners\nLos Angeles City College alumni\nUniversity of Arizona alumni\nPeople from Bellingham, Washington\nMale actors from Los Angeles\nPeople from Mariposa, California\nScreenwriters from California\nScreenwriters from Washington (state)\nScreenwriters from Arizona\n20th-century American screenwriters\n20th-century American male writers\nUnited States Navy personnel of World War II\nUnited States Navy non-commissioned officers", "machine_text": " Bob Arbogast (born July 4, 1932) is an American sportscaster, primarily known for his work on the West Coast.

The veena is a generic term for a plucked instrument, with many variations, and is thus somewhat similar to the guitar. Although the veena may be found in many different regions, it is typically associated with the Indian subcontinent. The oldest veena in India is the veena dussels, which dates back to the 3rd century BC. It is a very large instrument, with a neck that can be as long as 5 feet (1.5 m) and is made out of a single piece of wood. The body of the instrument is made out of a large piece of log, and the instrument is played by sitting on the ground. The veena dussels was traditionally used as a solo instrument, and as such, is typically associated with the Indian classical music tradition. However, it is also used in many other genres of music, including folk, pop, and filmi. The most common veena in India is the veena ekaki, which is a smaller instrument, with a neck that is typically around 2 feet (0.6 m) in length. It is played by holding the neck in one hand, and plucking the strings with the fingers of the other hand. The veena ekaki is used in both solo and ensemble performances, and is a key instrument in many different genres of music, including Indian classical music, folk, pop, and filmi. It is also used in many different regional styles, such as the Carnatic music of South India, and the Hindustani music of North India. The veena gauvau is another type of veena that is popular in India. It is similar to the veena ekaki, but has a deeper body, and is played by sitting on the ground. The veena gauvau is used in both solo and ensemble performances, and is a key instrument in many different genres of music, including Indian classical music, folk, pop, and filmi.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fluid kinematics\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fluid kinematics is a term from fluid mechanics, usually referring to a mere mathematical description or specification of a flow field, divorced from any account of the forces and conditions that might actually create such a flow. The term fluids includes liquids or gases, but also may refer to materials that behave with fluid-like  properties, including crowds of people or large numbers  of grains if those are describable approximately under the continuum hypothesis as used in continuum mechanics.\n\nUnsteady and convective effects\nThe composition of the material contains two types of terms: those involving the time derivative and those involving spatial derivatives. The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow.\n\nThe portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the convective derivative. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different.\n\nAcceleration field\nThe acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using an Eulerian description for velocity, the velocity field V = V(x,y,z,t), and deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the acceleration field.\n\nReferences\n\nKinematics\nFluid mechanics", "machine_text": " Fluid kinematics Fluid kinematics deals with the description of the motion of fluids. A fluid is a substance that has the ability to flow, and a fluid kinematics is based on the idea that the motion of a fluid is the result of the collisions between the fluid molecules. If a fluid is moving, then it has some momentum, and the distribution of this momentum is described by the continuity equation. The conservation of the momentum in a fluid is one of the basic laws of fluid kinematics. When a fluid is moving, it is also possible to describe the motion by following a single fluid particle. The path followed by this fluid particle is called a streamline. The velocity of the fluid particle is called the streamline velocity. If the fluid is moving in a straight line, then the streamline is also a straight line, and the streamline velocity is constant. The behavior of a fluid is described by the properties of the fluid particles. These properties include the velocity, pressure, and temperature. The relationship between these properties is described by the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid. The equations are named after their discoverers, Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations are used to describe the motion of a fluid in a variety of situations, including the flow of blood in the arteries, the flow of water in a pipe, and the flow of air over an airplane wing. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations are also used to describe the behavior of a fluid when it is subject to an external force, such as the force from a pump or the force from a wind. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations, and they can be difficult to solve. However, there are a variety of techniques that can be used to solve the equations, including the method of characteristics, the Laplace transform, and the finite element method.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 45498354}

The band was created in 1988 with heavy influences from Metallica and other important metal acts of the 80s, as well as some popular Latino music.\n\nCareer \nEven since their beginning as a metal band, Ekhymosis (Greek:  ecchymosis \"bruise\") showed the same pro-Latino lyrics as Kraken. After some live performances to become known in their city (and more regions of Colombia), the band recorded a demo of two songs, which described the violence in Medell\u00edn and the injustice of innocent deaths and other problems in Colombia. The demo sold out (thanks to friends and family of the band), and they decided to record a second. This time Ekhymosis had luck: In the studio was a Codiscos representative; she heard and liked the demo and the band signed with that label.\n\n1993 saw the release of Ni\u00f1o Gigante, a heavy metal album that included one of the band's most well known songs, \"Solo\". Controversy and the term \"sell-out\" surrounded the band with their next release: 1994's Ciudad Pac\u00edfico, produced by Federico L\u00f3pez, a more hard rock-oriented record with more Latin sounds. Ekhymosis was looking for their unique sound; they didn't want to be the \"Spanish Metallica\". Rather, they wanted to create Colombian rock.\n\nIn the following year, 1995, the band with its two new members, released Amor Biling\u00fce, topping the Colombian charts with the single \"De Madrugada\". The video of the song had incredible replay value on MTV Latino. The same year, Ekhymosis recorded a rock version of the National Anthem of Colombia, which caused controversy among some, but was well received among Colombian youth. Ekhymosis was the chosen band to open for Bon Jovi in November of that year, but due to the murder of the politician Alvaro G\u00f3mez the band decided not to play in order to allow the concert to finish earlier.\n\nThe next year, the band released their unplugged album, titled Ac\u00fastico, and Ekhymosis decided to go to Los Angeles where they played in local pubs and began recording their new album. In 1996, the band, now with four members (Juan Esteban, Andr\u00e9s, Toby and Jos\u00e9) recorded in L.A. their self-titled album, which saw the re-makes of three of their best songs (\"Solo\", \"Sin Rencores\", \"De Madrugada\") and new ones, the most remarkable being \"La Tierra\", known by some fans as \"the second Colombian Anthem\". The band was at its peak, but little knew the fans that those were the last days of one of the most important bands in Colombia.\n\nIn 1997, Ekhymosis won 3 Shock Awards (Best National Group, Best Song for \"La Tierra\", and Best Composer for Juan Esteban). Some months later, due to internal problems in deciding the future of the band, Ekhymosis disbanded. Juan Esteban, then, began his solo career as Juanes; the drummer of the band, Jose Lopera, worked with him on his first album, and has continued to work with Juanes to this day; the guitarist of Ekhymosis, Toby, started to play with Juanes on his second album and has continued with Juanes as well. Juanes has been known to perform Ekhymosis songs at his concerts, namely \"Solo\" and \"La Tierra\".\n\nReunion \n\nIn 2012, the band announced a reunion with new members, in a rendition to their origins as a thrash metal band, and playing their early songs before 1992.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, pop music was in a state of transition. The first generation of rock and roll stars were growing old, and a new breed of younger performers were starting to achieve stardom. The first wave of British Invasion acts, led by the Beatles, had already changed the face of popular music, and the second wave of British acts, led by the Rolling Stones, were starting to make their mark. At the same time, the early days of electronic music were producing a new sound, which was just beginning to make its way into popular music. The first electronic instruments, such as the therevox and the electric organ, were just starting to become popular, and the first electronic music composers, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, were just starting to make their mark. The result was a period of experimentation and exploration, as musicians tried to find a new sound that would define the era. Flexipop was a result of this search. It was a fusion of pop and electronic music, designed to be played in discoth\u00e8ques, or dance halls. The music was usually upbeat and had a strong beat, designed to get people dancing. It was also usually associated with drugs, particularly MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, or \"ecstasy\"). The combination of the upbeat music and the drug induced euphoria often created a feeling of unity and togetherness, and the music became a central part of the discoth\u00e8que culture. The first flexipop acts were primarily European, and included acts such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, the Small Faces, the Doors, and the Seeds. However, as the genre grew, it began to include acts from other parts of the world, such as the United States, Australia, and Japan. Some of the more well-known acts from outside Europe include the Beach Boys, the Byrds, the Who, the Small Faces, the Kinks, the Doors, the Seeds, the Who, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Monkees. The flexipop era lasted from the late 1960s until the early 1970s, and was a major part of the discoth\u00e8que culture of the era. However, as the 1970s progressed, the genre began to be replaced by a new form of electronic music, known as disco. Disco was a more commercial form of electronic music, and was designed to be played in a wider range of settings, such as clubs, parties, and radio. As a result, flexipop began to be seen as a more niche genre, and the number of new acts began to decline.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13099381}

Actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised their roles as Del Boy and Rodney in the sketch written by Jim Sullivan and Dan Sullivan; the script included previously unused material written by their father John Sullivan, who created and wrote every episode of the series. David Beckham guest starred,  Beckham having got in touch with Jim Sullivan.\n\nAccording to Shazam Productions there was a lot of interest in the sketch. The return of Only Fools and Horses was eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981 until 2003.\n\nThis special sketch was dedicated to the memory of John Sullivan and Roger Lloyd-Pack, who had both died prior to its broadcast.\n\nSynopsis \nAn unspecified amount of time after the series' last regular episode \"Sleepless in Peckham,\" Del Boy is in Peckham market, trying to sell \"Golden Balls\" underpants which are supposedly endorsed and signed by David Beckham (in return for Del Boy securing a bouncy castle for the birthday party of one of Beckham's son's, Brooklyn, who Del incorrectly calls Brookside), with Rodney serving as a less-than-enthusiastic model. After failing to sell anything, the Trotters retreat to a nearby cafe, where Rodney complains about Del's treatment of him. Del apologises, mentioning several incidents where he had mistreated Rodney. (These being incidents from previous regular Only Fools and Horses episodes.) Sharing the table with the two is David Beckham, who it turns out actually has endorsed the underpants. The three briefly chat, including Rodney and Beckham discussing their favourite artist (Rodney choosing Matisse, and Beckham choosing Tony Hart), before Beckham gives Rodney tips on how to model underwear effectively, advising him to \"glide\" and \"oscillate.\"\n\nLater on, Del is again trying to sell the underpants, with Rodney putting on a bizarre, vaguely feminine walk, and being even more angry at Del than he was before, telling him \"Derek, I'm going to kill you\". Beckham is discreetly watching this, when a young boy walks up to him, and asks him if he's David Beckham. He says that he is, and signs the boy's football, but says not to tell anyone he is there, as he does not want to draw anymore attention to himself. Beckham then attempts to lean back on a goods cart, but a trader moves it away while he isn't looking and he falls to the ground (referencing a famous moment in the episode \"Yuppy Love\"), getting the attention of everyone in the market.

The most successful team based in Peckham, and the only one to have progressed to the highest level of English football, was Crystal Palace, who played at the now-demolished Crystal Palace Stadium from 1917 until their relocation to Selhurst Park in South Norwood in 1924. In the 1960s, the area became the home of the most successful team in the country, as England's World Cup winners lived in the area. Manager Alf Ramsey, and players Jimmy Greaves, Ron Springett, George Eastham, Ron Springett, Ron Greenwood, Norman Hunter, Terry Paine, Ron Springett, and Alan Ball all lived in the area. The most famous footballing family in the country, the Beckhams, lived in the area for many years. The family patriarch, Ted Beckham, moved to Peckham in the 1950s, and his sons, Bobby, Ron, and Jack, all grew up in the area. The three brothers were all professional footballers, and Jack and Ron also became managers. The most famous of the three, Bobby Beckham, is regarded as one of the greatest British players of all time. He spent the majority of his career at Manchester United, where he won the European Cup, and also played for the England national team. After retiring from football, he became a football manager, and also worked as a football commentator. In the 1990s, the area was the home of another of the country's most successful teams, as Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup while based at nearby Highbury.

The family is one of several families identified by DNA\u2013DNA hybridisation studies to be part of the  Australo-Papuan songbird radiation. There is some molecular support for suggesting that their closest relatives are the large lyrebirds.\n\nAs their name implies, treecreepers forage for insects and other small creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf-litter, and on fallen timber. Unlike the Holarctic treecreepers they do not use their tail for support when climbing tree trunks, only their feet.\n\nAustralasian treecreepers nest in holes in trees. The species in the family hold breeding territories, although the extent to which they are defended and last varies. Some species, such as the red-browed treecreeper and the brown treecreeper are cooperative breeders, others, like the white-throated treecreeper are not.  The cooperative breeders form groups or a single breeding pair as well as up to three helpers, which are usually the young males of previous pairings. Helpers assist with the construction of the nest, feeding of the incubating female and feeding and defending the young.\n\nDescription\nThe Australasian treecreepers are small oscine songbirds, measuring  in length and weighing . They have relatively long tails, short legs with strong feet, stout bodies and longish and slightly down-curved bills. The plumage of this family is dull, trending towards brown, reddish-brown or greyish brown above and paler below. There is usually some sexual dimorphism in plumage, with females having some reddish colour in the head or breast that is absent in the males. Other differences between the sexes are common, and can arise very early in the life of these birds, being present even in late-stage nestlings. They are poor fliers, with their flight described as undulating and gliding.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nAll the Australian treecreepers are endemic to Australia except for one species restricted to New Guinea. They are found across much of Australia except for the large island of Tasmania, possibly because they are poor fliers and unable to disperse across water barriers, or possibly because of a lack of bark-dwelling invertebrates to feed on.\n\nAcross their global distribution they occupy a wide range of habitats. The Papuan treecreeper is found in mid-montane to montane forested habitats on New Guinea, from . The white-browed treecreeper inhabits acacia and Casuarina woodlands in deserts in southern Australia. Other species inhabit subtropical rainforest, eucalypt woodlands and southern beech forests. The brown treecreeper is semi-terrestrial and can live in more open woodland habitats, but is still sensitive to the loss of its habitat. The Australasian treecreepers are essentially non-migratory, although there are distinct differences in the dispersal of young birds after fledging, especially between the two genera.\n\nBehaviour\n\nDiet and feeding\nThe Australasian treecreepers principally forage for arthropods found on the bark of trees, but they will also take prey from the ground and will eat tree sap and nectar from flowers. They commonly obtain insect prey by gleaning from surface of bark, but will also probe into holes and pull at loose strips of bark and flick underneath it with their quadrifid tongue.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nReferences\n\n Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D.

It is found in Australia and New Guinea. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is a small, brown, ground-dwelling bird. The adult has a length of 11 to 13 cm (4.3 to 5.1 in), a wing length of 6.5 to 8 cm (2.6 to 3.1 in) and a weight of 8 to 9 g (0.28 to 0.35 oz). The bill is dark grey, long and slender. The legs and feet are pale grey. The head is grey with a pale, white cheek patch. The upper body is dark chocolate brown to black, with the feathers having a slight gloss. The lower body is a lighter brown with a pale brown belly and white undertail coverts. The male and female are similar in appearance. The Australasian treecreeper is found in south-eastern Australia, from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to the New South Wales south coast, as well as in the Australian Capital Territory and the islands of Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It is also found in the lowlands of New Guinea. It is a common species and is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Australasian treecreeper is found in forest and woodland, as well as parks and gardens, where it feeds on the ground on ants and other small invertebrates. It can be seen hopping quickly on the ground, pecking at the surface to disturb prey. It can also be seen climbing trees, using its tail for support. The species is solitary, although several may be seen together where their territories overlap. It is territorial, with pairs defending a territory of 1,000 to 2,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) and engaging in displays to mark their territory. The Australasian treecreeper pairs with one partner for life. The nest is built by the female, and is a small, open cup made of twigs and lined with hair. It is usually located in the fork of a tree or in the corner of a building. The nest is sometimes reused in later years. Two or three eggs are laid, and are pale blue with brown spots. The eggs are incubated by the female for fourteen days, with the chicks being fed by both parents. The young birds leave the nest after fifteen days. The Australasian treecreeper is insectivorous, with ants making up a large part of the diet. It is sometimes known to take small fruits and seeds.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 268105}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"USS Atlanta (CL-51)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "USS Atlanta (CL-51) of the United States Navy was the lead ship of the  of eight light cruisers. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Designed to provide anti-aircraft protection for US naval task groups, Atlanta served in this capacity in the naval battles Midway and the Eastern Solomons. Atlanta was heavily damaged by Japanese and friendly gunfire in a night surface action on 13 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The cruiser was sunk on her captain's orders in the afternoon of the same day.\n\nAtlanta, in some works, is designated CLAA-51 because of her primary armament as an anti-aircraft cruiser. Hence, all of the Atlanta-class ships are sometimes designated as CLAA. However, her entire battery of  guns were dual-purpose (DP) guns, and were capable of being used against both air and surface targets, able to fire anti-aircraft, high-explosive and armor-piercing shells. \n\nThe Atlanta-class ships were lightly armored, making them poor surface combatants compared to a typical light cruiser. In terms of armament, the Atlanta class was closer to a destroyer, being armed with 5-inch guns, than a light cruiser, which were generally equipped with 6-inch guns; but at well over  in length, and combined with their large battery of sixteen  guns (reduced to twelve in number for later ships of the class), they were designated as light cruisers. Typical destroyers of the time only carried five or six 5-inch guns.  Despite being under-armored for light cruisers, they had thicker armor than destroyers, which were notoriously underprotected.\n\nConstruction and commissioning\nThe first of the new class of ships was laid down on 22 April 1940 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., launched on 6 September 1941, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of Gone with the Wind), and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 December 1941, Captain Samuel P. Jenkins in command.\n\nArmament\nAtlanta was fitted with eight twin 5-inch gun mounts, placed in a unique configuration. She had three forward mounts and three aft mounts, mounted inline and increasing in height toward the midships, giving her a symmetrical appearance, with a \"gap\" in the middle superstructure. In addition, the aft battery also had one \"wing-mounted\" mount on each side, for a total of 16 five-inch guns. The firing arcs of the forward and aft batteries intersected at a very limited angle, giving her an arc of 60\u00b0 in which she could fire all of her guns broadside (excluding the wing mounts). Because Atlanta was able to bring all her guns to bear only within that narrow arc, her ability to engage surface targets was limited. Her firing arcs were ideally suited to bringing her guns to bear on an aircraft, however, with a minimum of six guns available from any angle.\n\nService history\nAfter fitting out, Atlanta conducted shakedown training until 13 March 1942, first in Chesapeake Bay and then in Maine's Casco Bay, after which she returned to the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Adjudged to be \"ready for distant service\" on 31 March, the new cruiser departed New York for the Panama Canal Zone on 5 April. She reached Cristobal on 8 April. After transiting the isthmian waterway, Atlanta then cleared Balboa on 12 April with orders to reconnoiter Clipperton Island, a tiny barren, uninhabited atoll about 670\u00a0mi (1,080\u00a0km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, in the course of her voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, for any signs of enemy activity. Finding none, she ultimately reached Pearl Harbor on 23 April.\n\nBattle of Midway\n\nPunctuating her brief stay in Hawaiian waters with an antiaircraft practice off Oahu on 3 May, Atlanta, in company with , sailed on 10 May as escort for  and , bound for Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia. On 16 May, she joined Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16 (TF 16), formed around the aircraft carriers  and , as it steamed back to Pearl Harbor, having been summoned back to Hawaiian waters in response to an imminent Japanese thrust in the direction of Midway Atoll. TF 16 arrived at Pearl on 26 May.\n\nAtlanta again sailed with TF 16 on the morning of 28 May. Over the days that followed, she screened the carriers as they operated northeast of Midway in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. At the report of Japanese ships to the southwest, on the morning of 4 June, Atlanta cleared for action as she screened Hornet. Squadrons from the American carriers sought out the Japanese, and during that day, planes from  and Enterprise inflicted mortal damage on four irreplaceable enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese planes twice hit TF 17, and it took the brunt of the enemy attacks. Over the days that followed the Battle of Midway, Atlanta remained in the screen of TF 16 until 11 June, when the task force received orders to return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nReaching her destination on 13 June, Atlanta, outside brief periods of antiaircraft practice on 21 and 25\u201326 June, remained in port, taking on stores and provisions and standing on 24-hour and then 48-hour alert into July 1942. Drydocked on 1\u20132 July so that her bottom could be scraped, cleaned and painted, the cruiser completed her availability on 6 July and then resumed a busy schedule of gunnery practice with drone targets, high-speed sleds, and in shore bombardment in the Hawaiian operating area.\n\nOn 15 July 1942, Atlanta, again in TF 16, sailed for Tongatapu. Anchoring at Nuku\u02bbalofa, Tonga on 24 July, where she fueled  and then took on fuel from Mobilube, the light cruiser pushed on later the same day and overtook TF 16. On 29 July, as all preparations proceeded for the invasion of Guadalcanal, Atlanta was assigned to TF 61.\n\nScreening the carriers as they launched air strikes to support the initial landings on 7\u20138 August, Atlanta remained there until the withdrawal of the carrier task forces on 9 August. For the next several days, she remained at sea, replenishing when necessary while the task force operated near the Solomons.\n\nBattle of the Eastern Solomons\n\nAs the Americans consolidated their gains on Guadalcanal, the critical need for reinforcements prompted Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to send the Combined Fleet south to cover a large troop convoy. American scout planes spotted the Japanese forces on the morning of 23 August. With the enemy reported to the northwest, Enterprise and  launched search and attack planes, but they failed to make contact because of deteriorating weather and the fact that the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted, reversed course.\n\nThroughout the day on 24 August, Atlanta received enemy contact reports and screened Enterprise as she launched a strike group to attack the Japanese carriers. The sighting of an enemy \"snooper\" at 1328 sent Atlantas sailors to general quarters, where they remained for the next 5\u00bd hours. At 1530, the cruiser worked up to  as TF 16 stood roughly north-northwestward \"to close [the] reported enemy carrier group.\" At 1637, with unidentified planes approaching, Atlanta went to . Enterprise then launched a strike group shortly thereafter, completing the evolution at 1706.\n\nIn the meantime, the incoming enemy bombers and fighter aircraft from  and  prompted the task force to increase speed to , shortly after Enterprise completed launching her own aircraft, the Japanese raid, estimated by Captain Jenkins to consist of at least 18 Aichi D3A1 \"Val\" dive bombers, came in from the north northwest at 1710. Over the next 11 minutes, Atlantas ,  and 20 mm batteries contributed to the barrage over Enterprise, as the light cruiser conformed to Enterprises every move as she maneuvered violently to avoid the dive bombers.\n\nDespite the heavy antiaircraft fire, Enterprise took one hit and suffered some shrapnel damage from an estimated five near hits. Captain Jenkins later reported that his ship may have shot down five of the attackers. Atlanta was not damaged in the engagement.\n\nReporting to TF 11 for duty the following day, Atlanta operated with that force, redesignated TF 61 on 30 August, over the next few days. When  torpedoed Saratoga on 31 August, the light cruiser screened the stricken flagship as  rigged a towline and began taking her out of danger. The force ultimately put into Tongatapu on 6 September, where Atlanta provisioned ship, fueled from , and enjoyed a period of upkeep.\n\nUnderway on 13 September, the light cruiser escorted  and  on 15 September. After seeing her charges safely to their destination at Dumbea Bay, Noum\u00e9a, on 19 September, Atlanta fueled, took on stores and ammunition, and sailed on 21 September as part of Task Group 66.4 (TG 66.4). Becoming part of TF 17 on 23 September, the light cruiser was detached the following day to proceed in company with ,  and  to Tongatapu, which she reached on 26 September.\n\nUnderway with those same ships on 7 October, Atlanta briefly escorted Guadalcanal-bound transports from 11 to 14 October, before putting into Espiritu Santo for fuel on the afternoon of the 15th. Assigned then to Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee's TF 64, the ship sailed after dark that same day to resume operations covering the ongoing efforts to secure Guadalcanal. Returning briefly to Espiritu Santo for fuel, stores and provisions, the warship stood out from Segond Channel on the afternoon of 23 October.\n\nTwo days later, with a Japanese Army offensive having failed to eject the Americans from Guadalcanal, Admiral Yamamoto sent the Combined Fleet south in an attempt to annihilate the American naval forces doggedly supporting the marines. Atlanta operated in TF 64, along with Washington, ,  and two destroyers, as the opposing forces engaged in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October. That day, Atlanta patrolled astern of the fueling group supporting the two American carrier task forces. On 27 October, when  attacked TF 64, the force maneuvered at high speed to clear the area.\n\nOn the morning of 28 October, Atlanta brought on board Rear Admiral Norman Scott from San Francisco, and became the flagship of the newly designated TG 64.2. After fueling from Washington, Atlanta, screened by four destroyers, headed northwest to shell Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. Reaching the waters off Lunga Point on the morning of 30 October, Atlanta embarked Marine liaison officers at 0550, and then steamed west, commencing her bombardment of Point Cruz at 0629 while the destroyers formed a column astern. Provoking no return fire, TG 64.2 accomplished its mission and returned to Lunga Point, where Atlanta disembarked the liaison officers. She then proceeded, in company with her screen, to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on the afternoon of 31 October.\n\nNaval Battle of Guadalcanal\n\nConvoy escort\n\nAtlanta served as Admiral Scott's flagship as the light cruiser, accompanied by four destroyers, escorted ,  and  to Guadalcanal. The cruiser and her consorts continued to screen those ships, designated TG 62.4, as they lay off Lunga Point on 12 November unloading supplies and disembarking troops.\n\nAt 0905, the task group received a report that nine bombers and 12 fighters were approaching from the northwest, and would reach their vicinity at about 0930. At about 0920, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries to the north in column, with the destroyers spaced in a circle around them. 15 minutes later, nine \"Vals\" from  emerged from the clouds over Henderson Field, the American airstrip on Guadalcanal. The American ships opened fire soon after, putting up a barrage that downed \"several\" planes. Fortunately, none of the primary targets of the attack, Zeilin, Libra and Betelgeuse, suffered more than minor damage from several close calls, though Zeilin sustained some flooding. The three auxiliaries returned to the waters off Lunga Point as soon as the attack ended and resumed working cargo and disembarking troops.\n\nA little over an hour later, at 1050, Atlanta received word of another incoming Japanese air raid. 15 minutes later, Atlanta led the three auxiliaries north with the destroyers in a circle around the disposition. The \"bogeys\", 27 Mitsubishi G4M \"Bettys\" from Rabaul, closed, sighted bearing west by north, approaching from over Cape Esperance in a very loose \"V\" formation. Although the destroyers opened fire, the planes proved to be out of range and the ships checked fire. The \"Bettys\", for their part, ignored the ships and continued on to bomb Henderson Field. Upon the disappearance of the planes, TG 62.4 resumed unloading off Lunga Point.\n\nOn 12 November, Atlanta was still off Lunga Point, screening the unloading, as part of TF 67 under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan in San Francisco. At about 1310, Atlanta received a warning that 25 enemy planes were headed for Guadalcanal, slated to arrive within 50 minutes. The light cruiser went to general quarters at 1318 and received the signal \"prepare to repel air attack....\"\n\nWithin six minutes, Atlanta and the other combatants of the support group formed a screen around the transport group (TG 67.1), and the two groups steamed north together at . At about 1410, the Americans sighted the incoming raid, consisting of what appeared to be 25 twin-engined bombers (\"Bettys\") which broke up into two groups after clearing Florida Island, and came in at altitudes that ranged from .  opened fire at 1412. Atlanta did so a minute later, training her guns at planes headed for the gap in the screen between San Francisco and . Atlanta claimed to have shot down two \"Bettys\", just after they dropped their torpedoes, at about 1415, only three minutes before the attack ended. Once the last Japanese plane had been splashed, the work of unloading the transports and cargo ships resumed. One \"Betty\", crippled by antiaircraft fire, crashed into the after superstructure of San Francisco, inflicting the only damage on the force.\n\nNight attack\nThe abrupt end of the air attack gave Atlanta and her colleagues only a brief respite, however, for trouble approached from yet another quarter. A Japanese surface force, made up of two battleships, one cruiser and six destroyers, was detected steaming south toward Guadalcanal to shell Henderson Field. Admiral Callaghan's support group was to \"cover [the retiring transports and cargo vessels] against enemy attack.\" TG 67.4 departed Lunga Point about 1800 and steamed eastward through Sealark Channel, covering the withdrawal of TG 67.1. An hour before midnight, Callaghan's ships reversed course and headed westward.\n\nHelenas radar picked up the first contact at a range of . As the range closed, Atlantas surface search radar, followed by her gunnery radars, picked up a contact on the enemy ships.\n\nAdmiral Callaghan's order for a course change caused problems almost at once, as Atlanta had to turn to port (left) immediately to avoid a collision with one of the four destroyers in the van, the latter having apparently executed a \"ships left\" rather than \"column left\" movement. As Atlanta began moving to resume her station ahead of San Francisco, the  illuminated the light cruiser. Atlanta shifted her main battery to fire at the enemy destroyer, opening fire at a range of about  and, along with other US ships that concentrated on Akatsukis searchlights, overwhelmed the destroyer.\n\nAs two other Japanese destroyers crossed her line, Atlanta engaged both with her forward  mounts, while her after mounts continued to blast away at the illuminated ship. An additional, unidentified assailant also opened up on the light cruiser from the northeast. At about that time, at least one torpedo plowed into Atlantas forward engine room from the port side, fired almost certainly by either  or  (Akatsukis destroyer consorts). Atlanta lost all but auxiliary diesel power, suffered the interruption of her gunfire, and had to shift steering control to the steering engine room aft. Meanwhile, Akatsuki drifted out of the action and soon sank with heavy loss of life. Michiharu Shinya, Akatsukis Chief Torpedo Officer, one of her few survivors, was rescued the next day by US forces and spent the rest of the war in a New Zealand prisoner of war camp. He later stated unequivocally that Akatsuki had not been able to fire any torpedoes that night before being overwhelmed by gunfire.\n\nSoon after being torpedoed, Atlanta was then hit by an estimated nineteen 8-inch (203\u00a0mm) shells when San Francisco, \"in the urgency of battle, darkness, and confused intermingling of friend or foe\", fired into her. Though almost all of the shells passed through the thin skin of the ship without detonating, scattering green dye, fragments from their impact killed many men, including Admiral Scott and members of his staff. Atlanta prepared to return fire on her new assailant, but San Francisco's own gun flashes disclosed a distinctly \"non-Japanese hull profile\" that resulted in a suspension of those efforts. San Francisco's shells, which passed high through Atlanta's superstructure, may have been intended for a Japanese target further beyond her from San Francisco's perspective.\n\nAfter the  fire ceased, Atlantas Captain Jenkins took stock of the situation, and, having only a minor foot wound, made his way aft to Battle II. His ship was badly battered, largely powerless, down by the head and listing slightly to port, and a third of his crew was dead or missing. As the battle continued, the light cruiser's men began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and succoring the many wounded.\n\nSinking\nDaylight revealed the presence nearby of three burning American destroyers, the disabled Portland, and the abandoned hulk of , which Portland summarily dispatched with three salvoes. Atlanta, drifting toward the enemy-held shore east of Cape Esperance, dropped her starboard anchor, and her captain sent a message to Portland explaining the light cruiser's condition. Boats from Guadalcanal came out to take her most critically wounded. By mid-morning, all of those had been taken off the ship.\n\n arrived at 09:30 on 13 November, took Atlanta under tow, made harder by the cruiser's still lowered anchor, and headed toward Lunga Point. During the voyage, a \"Betty\" bomber neared the disposition, and one of the two surviving  mounts\u2014which was powered by a diesel generator\u2014fired and drove it off. The other manually-rotated mount could not be trained on the target in time.\n\nAtlanta reached Kukum about 14:00, at which point Captain Jenkins conferred with his remaining officers. As Jenkins, who was later awarded a Navy Cross for his heroism during the battle, later wrote, \"It was by now apparent that efforts to save the ship were useless, and that the water was gaining steadily.\" Even had sufficient salvage facilities been available, he allowed, the severe damage she had taken would have made it difficult to save the ship. Authorized by Commander, South Pacific Forces, to act at his own discretion regarding the destruction of the ship, Jenkins ordered that Atlanta be abandoned and sunk with a demolition charge.\n\nAccordingly, all remaining men except the captain and a demolition party boarded Higgins boats sent out from Guadalcanal for the purpose. After the charge had been set and exploded, the last men left the battered ship. Ultimately, at 20:15 on 13 November 1942, Atlanta sank 3\u00a0mi (5\u00a0km) west of Lunga Point in about 400\u00a0ft (120\u00a0m) of water. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943.\n\nExploration of the wreck\nThe wreck of USS Atlanta was discovered in 1992 by an expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, (ROV). Dr. Ballard was famous for leading the expeditions that discovered  and the . Unfortunately, strong ocean currents and poor visibility prevented the expedition from thoroughly exploring Atlanta. In 1994, two Australian technical divers Rob Cason and Kevin Denlay traveled to Solomon Islands with the intention of being the first scuba divers to dive Atlanta but this was unsuccessful because of the lack of a suitable surface support vessel and strong surface currents; this was also the first mixed gas scuba diving expedition to Guadalcanal. However, they did manage to dive one of the two other deepest diveable wrecks; the Japanese transport Azumasan Maru, which is almost  deep at the stern. Many other World War II wrecks discovered by Dr. Ballard in Iron Bottom Sound are beyond the current technical limit for scuba and are only accessible by ROVs or submersibles. Dr Ballard gives an account of this in his book The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal. In 1995 Denlay returned with American Terrance Tysall - with the specific intention of diving USS Atlanta -  and one of their 'work-up dives' was on the Sasako Maru, one of the other  deepest diveable wrecks at the time, which is over  in the collapsed debris field of the bridge. They then went on to make the first successful scuba dive on USS Atlanta, which was at the time the deepest wreck dive by free swimming divers in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn the following years, Denlay and Tysall mounted several larger expeditions to survey Atlanta, exploring and videoing the wreck in detail to a depth of  at the bow. The civil unrest in Solomon Islands from late 1998 prevented further diving around Guadalcanal for several years. However, on the final expedition that year, the then deepest wreck dive by a woman was made by Kevin's wife, Mirja, on Atlanta. Denlay's last visit to the wreck was in 2002 using a closed circuit rebreather or CCR, the first CCR dive on Atlanta. Since then, very few dives have been conducted on Atlanta, although in May 2011 a very experienced deep diving team from Global Underwater Explorers successfully videoed the wreck for documentary purposes, the first survey of the wreck since Denlay's expeditions up to 1998.\n\nAwards\nAtlanta was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service and a Presidential Unit Citation for her \"heroic example of invincible fighting spirit\" in the battle off Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n U.S.S.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Data Tutashkhia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Data Tutashkhia () is a novel written by Chabua Amirejibi in 1975. It was translated to English by Antonina W. Bouis in 1985. This is one of the most popular readable novels in Georgia and former Soviet countries. The character is often compared to the English folklore hero Robin Hood .\n\nAbout novel \nThe novel is a story of a Georgian outlaw of the Imperial Russian period, a very popular theme in Georgian literature, and combines thrilling escapades with Dostoevskian dealings with the fate of an individual and national soul. The story is narrated by a Russian gendarme, Count Szeged, who frequently passes the story-telling on to other characters. The novel follows the life of outlaw Data Tutashkhia, who spends years eluding capture by the Tsarist police. They are led by Data's cousin, his detached and imperturbable double, Mushni Zarandia. The book, and the feature film based on it, turned Data Tutaskhia into an iconic hero, widely popular in Georgia.\n\nPlot and structure \nThe novel is divided into four parts chronicling its hero's, Data Tutashkhia's, moral evolution, always narrated from the perspective of a multitude of characters from  Tutashkhia's past. He is a man who from birth, can not stand injustice and wrongdoing. At the very beginning of the novel, we learn that he was convicted of an accidental killing that even the victim absolved him of! This then began his life as a fugitive, constantly running from police desperate to catch him. Throughout the novel, He goes from place to place, sees evil and struggles with how to overcome it. In the first part of the novel,  Tutashkhia attempts to help those wronged with little result, as either the individual wronged (strangely enough) continues to allow him/herself to be wronged (as in the case of the loser at cards continuing to allow himself to be cheated by card sharks); or the injured and insulted, once rescued by Data, start, themselves, to injure and insult (as was the case with the married pair whom  Tutashkhia assisted to purchase a cow). An excellent, memorable tale in this section of the novel was that of the hospital patients, whom he likened to the cannibal rats bred by one of the residents. \n\nIn the second part of the novel Data Tutashkhia, saddened by his previous experiences, decides not to intervene at all in societal issues unless absolutely certain that his actions would bring good. His new stance had the result of people forgetting all of his past good deeds, and turning on him for his 'indifference'. \n\nIn the third part of the novel, Tutashkhia, who has by this point lost his way, attempts to mingle in society in order to determine for himself a meaning and way forward in life. He joins the company of a lawyer and a mysterious woman and their little group engages in various philosophical debates over drinks (which it seems was/is a national pastime in Georgia!). This portion of the story was both interesting, in terms of the philosophical debates, and suspenseful The segment's climax, the dinner at the lawyer's home (with its 'mystery' guest), was particularly suspenseful and well written.\n\nIn the next section of the novel, Data Tutashkhia decides that evil can only be overcome by force. Here, we learn more about his cousin, who by this time, is one of the Russian imperial gendarme's 'best and brightest'. Completely -ahem- 'devoted' to his job and - ahem- ahem- 'unbiased', he zealously oversees a program to rid the region of 'dangerous' outlaws such as his cousin. It is in this section that we truly gain an understanding of which of the brothers really is the danger to society and the regime.\n\nIn the final part of the book,  Tutashkhia finally decides for himself, based on all of his past experiences, that the best way to rid the world of evil is to do good. This section of the novel features a gripping ending, as well as the final confrontation between Data and his family.\n\nExternal links \nNovel on Amazon.com\nNovel's review\nNovel on goodreads.com\n\nReferences \n\n1975 novels\nGeorgian-language works\nNovels by Chabua Amirejibi\nGeorgian novels\nHistorical novels\nPhilosophical novels", "machine_text": " Data Tutashkhia (Georgian: \u10e2\u10d0\u10e2\u10d0\u10e8\u10ee\u10d8\u10d0, Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0448\u0445\u0438\u044f, also known as Tatashekhia, Tatyshkhia, or Tetyshkhia) is a village in Georgia, in the Khobi district of the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Julius Fromm\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Julius Fromm (4 March 1883 \u2013 12 May 1945) was a Polish-German entrepreneur, chemist, and one of the inventors of the rubber condom and who also made several other elastomeric products such as rubber gloves and hot water bottles. Owing to his Jewish heritage, his company and personal property was stolen by the Nazis in aryanization when he left Germany for England in 1939. His legacy was not easily reclaimed by his relatives after the war however.\n\nBiography\nFromm was born in Konin, Poland, which was then part of autonomous Congress Poland within the Russian Empire. His parents were both Polish Jews and when Julius was ten years old his family left for Berlin in search of a better life. There, the family made a living by rolling cigarettes as many Eastern European Jews of Berlin did at the time. Julius's parents died young, so he was forced to take care of himself and his six siblings from the age of fifteen. As mechanization gradually replaced manual production, Fromm started attending evening classes in chemistry.\n\nWith World War I, Germany experienced a rapid liberalization of sexual values and sexually transmitted diseases spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of \"skin\": chemically treated intestine or bladder.  Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to vulcanize the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom.  Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped.  Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success\u2014Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms\u2014which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920, Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.\nThe company also made baby bottle nipples and rubber gloves by dipping formers into a rubber solution.\n\nNazi period\n\nIn 1938, however, under Nazi rule, the government forced Fromm to sell his factories for 116,000 Reichsmark, a fraction of their real value, to Baroness Elisabeth von Epenstein, Hermann G\u00f6ring's godmother. The process was known as aryanization, and involved selling or auctioning property of Jews at well below market value to German citizens. In return Epenstein gave two castles, Veldenstein and Mauterndorf, to G\u00f6ring. A year later he emigrated to London, where he died on 12 May 1945. Fromm's estate, which was worth the equivalent of approximately 30 million Euros, had already been auctioned off on 17 May 1943 for 2,255 Reichsmark, though many items including a grand piano, plates, and his library had already been bought or stolen before.\n\nFromms' factory in K\u00f6penick was almost completely destroyed by Allied Air raids, the remaining machinery was shipped to the Soviet Union, as it lay in the Soviet sector of Berlin. The Friedrichshagen factory continued to produce condoms, especially for the Red Army. \nThe factories would have been returned to Fromm's family according to the Potsdam Agreement, however the company was nationalized by the Communist government.\n\nIn East Germany, Fromms condoms were produced by the Volkseigener Betrieb \"Plastina\", the brand was renamed to \"Mondos\".\n\nIn West Germany, Julius Fromm's son Herbert Fromm was forced to pay 174,000 Marks to Otto Metz-Randa for the rights to the name Fromm. Metz-Randa, Elisabeth von Epenstein's lover, had acquired these rights after the death of G\u00f6ring's godfather, and managed to transform himself from a profiteer of \"Entjudung\" (de-jewification) to a victim of the National Socialist regime. Herbert Fromm licensed a Bremen company to produce Fromms condoms, which\u2014now called Mapa\u2014produces them to the present day.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \"Fromms\" in Das virtuelle Markenmuseum.

These countries included the USSR and all the Comecon members. NMP is the conceptual equivalent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United Nations System of National Accounts, although numerically the two measures are calculated differently.\n\nNMP is calculated for the material production sectors only, and excludes most of the service sectors, which are part of GDP. The material production sectors include manufacturing industries,  agriculture and forestry, construction, wholesale and retail trade, supply of material inputs, road maintenance, freight transport (but not passenger transport), communication and information services supporting material production, and other material production activities. It is calculated by subtracting the value of all production costs (including the cost of material inputs, depreciation, and labor in production) from the value of output produced in the material production sectors.\n\nFor comparison with GDP, it is necessary to add back to NMP the value of fixed asset depreciation (which is not subtracted in GDP calculations) and the total value of all services classified as \"non-productive\" in the socialist system of national accounts (which are part of GDP). These \"non-productive\" services include health care, education, housing, public utilities, consumer services, communication in the non-productive sector, passenger transport, financial services (banking, credit, insurance), government services, the defense establishment, and social organizations.

In 2017, Irizarry claimed membership of 200+ members. Irizarry also states that local branches exist in Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

James Alex Fields, who was later responsible for killing a counter protester and injuring 19 others in a vehicle-ramming attack, was seen marching with the group. The leadership later disavowed him, stating that he was not a member of the group. The group took part in the \"White Lives Matter\" rally in October 2017.\n\nThe group supports the right-wing nationalist concept of blood and soil.

The organization was founded by veterans of the 2016 armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, including Ammon Bundy, in order to \"defend\" the rights of \"European-American communities\" across the United States. The group has been involved in several public conflicts with left-wing and Islamist groups, and has recently become more active in conservative politics. The group's logo is the \"Don't Tread on Me\" snake, and they have adopted the Gadsden flag as their standard. In addition, they have also utilized the \"Thin Blue Line\" flag, which has been co-opted by several other far-right groups and individuals. They have recently launched a podcast called \"The Vanguard Hour\". The organization's chairman, Joe Biggs, was a featured speaker at the 2017 National Policy Institute Conference, along with Richard Spencer, who has since become the leader of the organization. Following the conference, the two groups released a joint statement, in which they declared their shared commitment to \"the preservation of Western Civilization\" and the \"white race\". In 2018, the group was involved in the formation of the \"Western Independence Party\", a political party which was formed with the intention of running candidates for political office in the 2018 midterm elections. The party was founded by three Vanguard America members, including Ammon Bundy. In 2019, the group was listed as a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Manchester City F.C. players\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Manchester City Football Club, then known as Ardwick, first entered the Football League in the 1892\u201393 season. Since that time the club's first team has competed in numerous nationally and internationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in 100 or more such matches are listed below, which encompasses all players who have been inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame. Also included are all winners of the Player of the Year award, which has been awarded annually since 1967 by the Manchester City Official Supporters Club based on a ballot of the supporters.\n\nAlan Oakes holds the record for Manchester City league appearances, having played 565 matches between 1959 and 1976. If all senior competitions are included, Oakes has 680. \n\nAs of 1 August 2020, the player who has won the most international caps while playing at the club is David Silva with 87 for Spain. Prior to Silva achieving this distinction the record had previously been held by Joe Hart (63 caps) and Colin Bell, the latter of which held the record for over 40 years with 48 England appearances between 1968 and 1975. The current squad member with the most caps is Raheem Sterling, who has a total of 72 caps for England, of which 56 have been awarded while a City player. \n\nThe Manchester City player who has been capped the most times for England in total is Frank Lampard, who was capped 106 times for England between October 1999 and June 2014, but he only played for City for one season in 2014\u201315 after he had retired from international duty. The Manchester City player who has been capped the most times totally internationally is Shay Given, who was capped for the Republic of Ireland 134 times from 1996 to 2016. He played for the club for two and a half seasons between 2009 and 2011.\n\nSergio Ag\u00fcero holds the Manchester City goalscoring record across all competitions, and is also the club's highest league goalscorer. These records were set between 2011 and 2021. As of 29 May 2021, Ag\u00fcero's record stood at 184 league goals scored and 260 overall for City.\n\nTommy Johnson holds the record for league goals in a single season, with 38 in 1928\u201329. This single season tally also means Johnson additionally holds the record for most goals scored per game played in a season, his 38 goals in 39 appearances during 1928\u201329 yielding a goal scoring rate of 0.97 goals per game.\n\nThe player who holds the Premier League records for the most lethal scoring rate (i.e., the highest number of goals scored per total minutes played); the most goals for a single club; and the most goals for a foreign player; as well as numerous club records is Sergio Ag\u00fcero who played for City between 2011 and 2021. During the 2013\u201314 season he scored 28 goals from 34 game appearances (or 0.82 goals per game), but since many of his appearances were not full 90 minute games; he actually averaged a goal for roughly every 90 minutes he was on the field, which made him not only the most efficient striker (in terms of minutes per goal) of any club in the Premier League that season \u2014 but also since the Premier League began.\n\nSourcing, currency and key for the statistics\n\nThe following information applies to both of the tables listed in the next section of this article:\n\nOrder\nPlayers are listed according to the date of their first team debut for the club.\n\nLegend\nPlayers listed in bold are inductees of one or more of the following: the Manchester City Hall of Fame, the National Football Museum Hall of Fame, or the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame.\nPlayers listed in italics are winners of the Player of the Year award (and the number of times they have each received this award is shown in the \"PotY\" column).\n\nNationality\nNormally the player's country of birth or later adopted nationality. In the case of a country such as Germany that has been unified it will indicate whichever of the prior nations, West or East, determined how that player was capped at international level during his playing career despite his nationality now being simply German.\n\nClub career\nClub career is defined as the first and last calendar years in which the player appeared for the club in any of the competitions listed below, regardless of how long the player was contracted to the club. For players who had two or more spells at the club, the years for each period are listed separately.\n\nPosition\nPlaying positions are listed according to the tactical formations that were employed at the time. Thus the more defensive emphasis in the responsibilities of many of the old forward and midfield positions, and their corresponding name changes, reflects the tactical evolution that occurred in the sport from the late 1960s onwards. The position listed is that in which the player played most frequently for the club.\n\nThe following information applies only to the table of \"Historic players\" listed in the next section:\n\nAppearances and Goals\nAppearances and goals comprise those in the Football League (including test matches and play-offs), Premier League, FA Cup, Football League Cup, UEFA European Cup, UEFA Cup, FA Charity Shield, Associate Members' Cup/Football League Trophy, and several now-defunct competitions \u2014 namely the European Cup Winners' Cup, Anglo-Italian Cup, Anglo-Italian League Cup, Texaco Cup, Anglo-Scottish Cup and Full Members' Cup.\nSubstitute appearances in any of the above included fixtures, and any goals scored as a substitute, are also included.\nAppearances or goals scored in testimonial matches, exhibition games, or in any abandoned fixtures, are excluded.\nAppearances in the 1939\u201340 Football League season (abandoned after three games because of the Second World War, and the records for which were expunged from official records), and any other matches played in wartime competitions, are excluded.\n\nStatistics sourcing\n\nAll of the Player of the Year data in the table is sourced from the history pages of the Happy to be Blue! web site, which lists all award winners up to, and including, season 2011\u201312.\nAll dates and numbers in the table are sourced from a hardcover book published in 2006 according to the inclusion / exclusion rules stated above. The individual table entries of a number of these players have subsequently been sourced from the web wherever possible.\nIn the case of players whose football careers at Manchester City spanned either of the two world wars, the choice of which appearances, during and either side of the wartime period, are included in the \"official\" tally of games played may cause discrepancies with other possible sources of similar data for those particular players. Likewise, how competitions such as the Charity Shield, Anglo-Scottish Cup and the Texaco Cup are handled by other sources will also create discrepancies with the numbers included in the table below.\n\nCurrency\nThe statistics are correct as of the beginning of 2004.\n\nThe following information applies only to the table of \"Contemporary players\" listed in the next section:\n\nAppearances and Goals\nAppearances and goals are broken out into four column pairs, with the rightmost column pair depicting the respective totals of the appearances and goals shown in the three leftmost column pairs.\nThe appearances and goals listed under the \"League\" column pair heading comprise those in the top two tiers of the Football League (including any Football League play-off games) and the Premier League.\nThe appearances and goals listed under the \"Cups\" column pair heading comprise only those in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.\nThe appearances and goals listed under the \"Other\" column pair heading comprise those in the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League/UEFA Cup, the FA Community Shield, and the Football League Trophy.\nSubstitute appearances in any of the above included fixtures, and any goals scored as a substitute, are also included.\nAppearances or goals scored in testimonial matches, exhibition games, or in any abandoned fixtures, are excluded.\n\nStatistics sourcing\nMost of the Player of the Year data in the following table (and elsewhere in this article) is sourced from the history pages of the Happy to be Blue! web site, which lists all award winners up to, and including, season 2011\u201312. Winners of the PotY award since 2012 are individually cited from elsewhere on the web.\nMost of the dates and numbers in the table are sourced from the Soccerbase online database as indicated by the individual cited reference notes for each of the players. The remainder are sourced from Gary James' book.\nHowever, Soccerbase has a few issues. It seems to identify all player appearances and goals scored in Community Shield fixtures on an individual season basis, but does not necessarily include all those appearances in the total appearances tally of certain players. Regardless, the core match data on which those tallies are sometimes mis-totalled is quite sound and accessible in alternative ways, and thus can be used to (self-)correct the database's own tallying errors if properly footnoted.\nGoals later reassigned by the Premier League \"Dubious Goals Committee\" also tend to get overlooked by Soccerbase. Some goals that have never even come before the DGC have been misattributed to other players despite the rest of the football media correctly attributing them. Whatever the source of the discrepancy it can be addressed by footnote reference to alternative match reports for the games in question \u2013 which correctly attribute the dubious goal(s) \u2013 and by providing links to documentation of the pertinent DGC reassignment findings elsewhere on the web.\n\nCurrency\nThe statistics are correct as of the last match of the 2020-21 season, which was played on 29 May 2021.\n\nList of players\nThe list of Manchester City players with over 100 appearances, or winners of \"Player of the Year\" award, is presented below in two tables. The first table lists all the club's historic players, providing only the basic \"appearances\" and \"goals\" totals for each of them. The second table groups together the club's most recent players, providing a more detailed breakdown of their \"appearances\" and \"goals\" statistics (and with the current players highlighted in blue for easy reference).\n\nHistoric players\n\nContemporary players\n\nClub captains\n\nMost prolific goalscorers \nThe players who have scored the most goals in total during their entire club career can be determined by sorting on the appropriate column in either of the above tables. Below is an additional sortable list of the most prolific Manchester City strikers' acumen in front of goal based on their best individual seasons for the club.  Current players are highlighted in blue.\n\nMost England caps\nThe following is a list of the most capped England internationals to play for Manchester City. The list is initially presented in the chronological order of the dates each player made his debut for England at full international level, but can be sorted based on the contents of the fourth column to display the players in order of most appearances for their country. The list includes all ten of the most capped players who played for England while also actively playing for the club (just sort the list instead based on the contents of the third column).  Players who won all of their England caps playing for Manchester City are indicated in bold font. Internationals with no caps won while playing at Manchester City are indicated in italics. Players who are currently internationally active players are highlighted in blue.\n\n* Parenthetical number represents total substitute appearances included in larger total appearances tally for those players for whom substitution is applicable.\n\nPlayer of the Year awards \nEach season since the end of the 1966\u201367 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.  The following table lists all of the recipients of this award since its inception.  All of these players are listed in italics font in the pair of tables presented in the main section of this article.\n\nFormer Manchester City players and managers inducted into Halls of Fame \nA number of former Manchester City players and managers have been inducted into the club's own Hall of Fame (which was inaugurated in 2004) as well as the national football Halls of Fame of both Scotland (also inaugurated in 2004) and England / Wales (inaugurated in 2002).

His father died from tuberculosis when he was a child. He and his younger brother joined the military and after graduating from the Mikhailovsky Artillery School he was sent to serve in the 33rd artillery brigade of the Kiev Military District.\n\nFrom 1904 he was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's Bolshevik faction and spread revolutionary and anti war propaganda during the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nIn April 1905, he \u00a0was sent to an artillery unit that took part in battles with Japanese troops in Manchuria. He resigned as a lieutenant in 1906, and in 1907 by the decision of the Kiev military district court he was deprived of all the rights of a retired officer.\n\nIn 1908 he was arrested for revolutionary activity, and on 24 February 1909 was sentenced by the Kiev District Court to administrative deportation to the Yenisei province. He served exile in the village of Tikhanovo, Belskaya volost, Yenisei district.\n\nIn 1910 he \u00a0escaped from exile and emigrated abroad with forged documents. He collaborated with the Bolsheviks. A member of the 9th Congress of the Second International in 1911 and the Poroninsky meetings of the Central Committee of the RSDLP with other party cadres. He was a member of the foreign editorial board of the journal \"Education\". He lived in France and Austria during exile, collaborated with V. I. Lenin and met with Joseph Stalin.\n\nHe broke with the Bolsheviks in 1914, became a Menshevik and maintained defencist positions.\n\nIn 1917 he returned to Russia, joined the Imperial Army, took part in hostilities on the Southwestern Front.\n\nHe was elected on the Menshevik list as a deputy to the Constituent Assembly, and spoke in favor of forming a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks in the elections. At the only meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 5 January 1918, he spoke on the issue of concluding peace, while transparently hinting that the Bolsheviks were selling Russian interests in the war for \"German gold\".\n\nAt the Moscow party conference in May 1918, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Menshevik Party\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, from 1918 to 1921 he served in the Red Army and was a teacher at the School of Senior Instructors.\n\nIn July 1918 he was arrested for anti-Soviet activities and was held in the Butyrka Prison fountil his release in October. He was arrested for the second time in September 1920, and was held in prison for one month.\n\nIn the spring of 1920, when discussing Yuli Martov's report The Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Democracy, Troyanovsky drew attention to \"the need for a more detailed answer to the question\" and about the relationship between bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy\" there are no grounds for it\", and then it should be admitted \"that the only correct path to socialism is the path of Lenin.\"\n\nFrom 1921 he was in the apparatus of the People's Commissariat of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection of the RSFSR, and in 1923 he officially joined the Russian Communist Party (b).\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927 he was chairman of the Board of the Gostorg of the RSFSR and a member of the board of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade of the USSR.\n\nSoviet diplomat \nFrom 14 November 1927 to 24 January 1933 he was the Plenipotentiary Representative of the USSR in Japan.\n\nIn 1933 he was deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR.\n\nFrom 20 November 1933 to 1 October 1938 Troyanovsky served as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the USSR in the United States. The presentation of credentials to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took place not two weeks later which was the usual procedure, but the day after Troyanovsky's arrival in Washington, which was evidence of the desire of the U.S. president to emphasize special respect and attention to the country. Welcoming Troyanovsky, Roosevelt expressed his satisfaction at the appointment to the post of Soviet ambassador to Washington \"a man known for his friendly attitude towards the USA\". The years of Troyanovsky's tenure as plenipotentiary representative of the USSR were years of formation of Soviet-American relations and the first steps towards cooperation in the trade, economic, scientific and cultural fields. Troyanovsky played an important role in the conclusion of the 1935 Soviet-American trade agreement, which was renewed annually in subsequent years. Roosevelt once joked at one of the receptions in the White House: \"If Mr. Troyanovsky says, looking at the moon, that this is the sun, I personally, gentlemen, will believe him...\".\n\nHe had direct access to Stalin, to whom he reported on the strengths of American life that were considered to be adopted by the USSR. In his reports from Washington he advocated rapprochement with the United States in the face of the threat of Nazism.\n\nLater life \nFrom 1941 he taught at the Higher Diplomatic School of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. From 1941 worked in the Soviet Information Bureau under the Council of Ministers of the USSR. From 1947 he was a professor at the Higher Diplomatic School.\n\nHe was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.\n\nTroyanovsky died on 23 June 1955, at the age of 73.

Troyanovsky was born in Moscow. His father, Ivan Troyanovsky, was a chemical engineer and his mother, Anna, was a housewife. He attended the Soviet military school Number One in Moscow, and then the Moscow State University. In 1950 he defended his candidate's thesis, and in 1958 he defended his doctoral dissertation. Troyanovsky was a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Sciences. He was a full professor at the Moscow State University and at the University of Missouri. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and at Harvard University. Troyanovsky was known for his works on the theory of manifolds, the theory of Lie groups, the theory of smooth structures on manifolds, and the theory of orthogonal structures on manifolds. He was one of the pioneers of the theory of foliations on manifolds. Troyanovsky was the author of more than 180 articles and three books: \"Differential geometry\", \"Smooth structures\", and \"Foliations\". The books \"Differential geometry\" and \"Smooth structures\" were translated into English and published by Springer. The third book, \"Foliations\", was also translated into English and published by the American Mathematical Society. Troyanovsky was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1987.

The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad earlier had established a station and picnic ground at Mount Gretna.\n\nHistory \nThe Gilded Age iron industrialist and railroad president Robert Habersham Coleman decided that a  narrow-gauge railroad to the top of nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a  spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of .  Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc  Forney locomotive, were three  \"American\" types (#11, #12 and #15) built by Baldwin Locomotive Works.  Locomotive #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only  gauge s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a  gauge  for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.\n\nRails weighing  were spiked onto the  face of ties   long.  A turntable, engine-house, water tank, runaround track, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna.  Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak.  During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. These eight passenger cars were built by the Jackson & Sharp Company. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down.  The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range.  A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic.  One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously from one side of the car. There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad.  The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.\n\nLocomotives\n\nCornwall and Lebanon Railroad \nThe standard-gauge Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad continued operations as a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later Penn Central Transportation Company until 1972. Hurricane Agnes caused flood damage, preventing operation of trains on the branch, and the damage was not repaired. The branch was converted to the 21st-century Lebanon Valley Rail Trail after the rails were removed.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\n2 ft gauge railways in the United States\nNarrow gauge railroads in Pennsylvania\nRailway lines closed in 1916\nDefunct Pennsylvania railroads", "machine_text": " The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway is a former narrow gauge railway that operated between Mount Gretna and Hershey, Pennsylvania. The railway was originally built as the Mount Gretna Railroad in 1896 by the Mount Gretna Property Owners' Association to provide both passenger and freight service to the community of Mount Gretna. The railroad was constructed as a narrow gauge line, with a gauge of three feet. The line was built along the west bank of the Conewago Creek, and ran for 2.8 miles (4.5 km), with a total elevation above sea level of 818 feet. The Mount Gretna Railroad was purchased by the Hershey Railroad in 1906. The Hershey Railroad, which was originally built as a standard gauge line, was subsequently converted to the same gauge as the Mount Gretna Railroad. The combined railroad was then operated as the Mount Gretna & Hershey Railroad, which provided service to both the Mount Gretna and Hershey communities. In 1909, the Mount Gretna & Hershey Railroad was purchased by the Hershey Chocolate Company, which used the railroad to bring supplies to the chocolate factory in Hershey. The railroad also provided passenger service to employees and visitors to the Hershey plant.

(This could be a device to convert the temperature of the surrounding air or water into the visually readable height of a column of mercury in a small tube, for example; but the conversion could also be made to an electronic encoding of the parameter, for reading by a computer system.)\n\nThe integral linearity is then a measure of the fidelity of the conversion that is performed by the measuring system. It is the relation of the output to the input over a range expressed as a percentage of the full-scale measurements.  Integral linearity is a measure of the device's deviation from ideal linear behaviour.\n\nThe most common denotation of integral linearity is independent linearity.\n\nIn the context of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), independent linearity is fitted to minimize the deviation with respect to the ideal behaviour with no constraints. Other types of integral linearity place constraints on the symmetry or end points of the linear fit with respect to the actual data.\n\nIn the case of position sensors, two general types exist. Differences between the two regarding independent linearity essentially relate to the type of mechanical interface - linear or rotary. For rotary position sensors, as a shaft (or in the case of magnetic sensors, a magnet) is turned over a defined mechanical range in a direction causing an increasing response, an output voltage changes from a minimum to maximum value. The variation from an ideal linear relationship as this device is changed from minimum to maximum range end-points is the independent linearity error. It is measured in a practical sense as deviation of output voltage as a percentage of input voltage with the maximum value as the range is traversed, usually being referred to in a device's specifications. The same description holds for linear position sensors except that a straight rod (or magnet) is moved along the length of the sensor or as it extends from the end of a linear position sensor.\n\nNotes\n\n \nMeasurement", "machine_text": " Integral linearity In electronics, integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of a circuit with respect to the integral of its input signal. A linear circuit is one in which the output is a linear function of the input. This means that the output is directly proportional to the input, with the proportionality constant being the gain of the circuit. circuits are the simplest type of linear circuit. In an amplifier, the output is an amplified version of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. A circuit with a gain of 10 will have an output voltage that is 10 times the input voltage. Integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of the circuit with respect to the integral of the input. An amplifier with good integral linearity will have an output voltage that is equal to the integral of the input voltage, with the gain being the ratio of the integral of the output voltage to the integral of the input voltage. For example, an amplifier with a gain of 10 will have an output voltage that is the integral of the input voltage, multiplied by 10. Good integral linearity is important in many types of circuits, including amplifiers, integrators, and differentiators. In these circuits, the output is a linear function of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output to the input. The gain is not constant, but is a function of the input signal. In order to have good integral linearity, the gain must be a linear function of the input signal. There are many ways to measure the integral linearity of a circuit. One way is to measure the gain of the circuit, and then use this gain to calculate the integral of the output voltage. The integral of the output voltage can then be compared to the integral of the input voltage to see if they are equal. Another way to measure the integral linearity of a circuit is to use a sinusoidal input signal. The output of the circuit will be a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency as the input signal, but with a different amplitude and phase. The integral of the output signal can then be compared to the integral of the input signal to see if they are equal. In general, integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of a circuit with respect to the integral of its input signal. A circuit with good integral linearity will have an output that is equal to the integral of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output to the input. Good integral linearity is important in many types of circuits, including amplifiers, integrators, and differentiators.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4819510}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Scott Perry (politician)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Scott Gordon Perry (born May 27, 1962) is an American politician. He is the U.S. representative for . It was numbered the 4th district from 2013 to 2019. It includes Harrisburg, York and most of the inner suburbs.\n\nA member of the Republican Party, Perry represented the 92nd district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He is a retired Pennsylvania Army National Guard brigadier general. In November 2021, Perry was elected chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group among U.S. House Republicans.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack called for an interview with Perry \u2013 the first time it publicly sought to question a sitting member of Congress. Perry emphatically declined the request the next day. The panel's chairperson said it had evidence from several witnesses that Perry had \"an important role\" in efforts to install Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general.\n\nEarly life and education\nPerry was born in San Diego, California. His family moved to Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a suburb of York, when he was seven. In 1980, he graduated from Northern High School in Dillsburg and Cumberland-Perry Vo-Tech School in York County, Pennsylvania. In 1991, Perry obtained a B.S. in business administration and management from Pennsylvania State University. In July 2012, he received a master's degree in strategic planning from the United States Army War College.\n\nMilitary service\n\nArmy National Guard\nPerry began his military career in 1980 when he enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and graduated from Advanced Individual Training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as a technical drafting specialist. He graduated from Pennsylvania's Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery.\n\nAfter receiving his commission, Perry qualified as a helicopter pilot in the Aviation branch. He served in a variety of staff and command assignments as he advanced through the ranks, including executive officer of 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment during deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002\u20133, and commander of 2nd Battalion (General Support), 104th Aviation Regiment beginning in 2008.\n\nIraq war\nIn 2009\u201310, Perry commanded 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment during its pre-deployment training and service in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Task Force Diablo, 2-104th Aviation was credited with flying 1,400 missions, accruing over 13,000 combat flight hours, and transporting over 3 million pounds of cargo and 43,000 soldiers and civilians. Perry was credited with flying 44 missions and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours.\n\nPost-Iraq\n\nAfter returning from Iraq, Perry was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Pennsylvania National Guard's 166th Regiment (Regional Training Institute) (2010\u201312). From 2012 to 2014, he commanded the garrison at the Fort Indiantown Gap National Training Center. In May 2014, Perry was assigned as one of the assistant division commanders of the 28th Infantry Division, and he was promoted to brigadier general in November 2015. In May 2016, he was assigned as assistant adjutant general for Army at the Pennsylvania National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters. Perry retired from the Pennsylvania National Guard on March 1, 2019.\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1993, Perry founded Hydrotech Mechanical Services, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm in Dillsburg. The firm provides contract construction and maintenance services to municipal and investor-owned utilities from North Carolina to New York, specializing in large meter calibration. In 2002, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection accused the company of altering sewage monitoring reports while doing work for the Memphord Estates Sewage Treatment Company. Perry faced criminal charges of conspiring to falsify state-mandated sewage records. In the aftermath of the investigation and review, he was allowed to complete a diversion program and avoid any criminal charges, which allowed him to maintain his U.S security clearance.\n\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\n\nElections\nIn 2006, state representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House district decided to retire. Perry won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote, and took office on January 2, 2007. In 2008, Perry was reelected to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he was reelected to a third term unopposed.\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\n\n2012\n\nIn 2012, Perry gave up his state house seat to run for the 4th congressional district. The district had previously been the 19th district, represented by six-term incumbent Republican Todd Platts, who was giving up the seat to honor a self-imposed term limit. In 2010, when Platts wanted to become U.S. Comptroller General, he spoke to Perry about running for the seat.\n\nPerry won a seven-way primary with over 50% of the vote. Although outspent nearly 2 to 1 in the campaign, he beat his closest competitor with nearly three times as many votes. Political newcomer Harry Perkinson, an engineer, advanced in a two-way Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 60%\u201334%.\n\n2014\n\nIn 2014, Perry was unopposed in the Republican primary and the former Harrisburg mayor, Linda D. Thompson, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Perry won the general election, 75%\u201325%.\n\n2016\n\nPerry won the 2016 election with no primary challenge and no official Democratic opponent. Joshua Burkholder of Harrisburg, a political novice, withdrew from the Democratic primary after too many signatures on his qualifying petition were successfully challenged. His subsequent write-in candidacy won the Democratic primary, but he was unaffiliated in the general election. Perry defeated Burkholder, 66%\u201334%.\n\n2018\n\nAfter ruling the state's congressional map an unconstitutional gerrymander, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new map for the 2018 elections. Perry's district was renumbered the 10th and made significantly more compact than its predecessor. It lost most of the more rural and Republican areas of York County to the neighboring 11th district (the old 16th). To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly to the north, absorbing the remainder of Democratic-leaning Dauphin County that had not been in the old 4th. On paper, the new district was less Republican than its predecessor. Had the district existed in 2016, Donald Trump would have won it with 52% of the vote to Hillary Clinton's 43%; Trump carried the old 4th with 58% of the vote.\n\nPastor and Army veteran George Scott won the Democratic primary by a narrow margin and opposed Perry in the general election for the reconfigured 10th. The two debated in October before Perry won with 51.3% of the vote to Scott's 48.7%, with the new district boundaries taking effect in 2019. Perry held on by winning the district's share of his home county, York County, by 11,600 votes. This was the district's closest race since 1974, when Bill Goodling won his first term in what was then the 19th with 51% of the vote.\n\n2020\n\nIn 2020, Perry had no Republican primary challenge, and the Pennsylvania auditor general, Eugene DePasquale, won a two-way Democratic primary. Perry was reelected with 53% of the vote in the general election.\n\nTenure\nPerry is a member of the Freedom Caucus. In November 2021, he was elected to chair the group, succeeding Andy Biggs in January 2022.\n\nIn October 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Perry accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of exaggerating the crisis in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn January 2018, Perry suggested that ISIS might have been involved in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities have maintained that gunman Stephen Paddock acted alone.\n\nIn December 2019, Perry was one of 195 Republicans to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Trump.\n\nIn October 2020, Perry was one of 17 Republicans to vote against a House resolution to formally condemn the QAnon conspiracy theory. He said he voted against the resolution because he was concerned about infringements on free speech, saying, \"it's very dangerous for the government ... to determine what is okay to like and what is not okay to like.\"\n\nIn March 2021, Perry voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He said only 9% of the act's spending was allotted to defeat the COVID-19 virus, while the rest would advance Democratic policies.\n\nIn April 2021, at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting on immigration, Perry said, \"For many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we're replacing national-born American\u2014native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation.\"\n\nIn June 2021, Perry was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6. He cosponsored a bill, introduced the same day, that would give the same medal to police officers without mentioning the attack.\n\nAt the June 2021 Republican Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, Perry said Democrats \"are not the loyal opposition. They are the opposition to everything you love and believe in\" and \"want to destroy the country you grew up in\", invoking comparisons to Nazis.\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2020, Perry voted against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021, which in part would prevent the president from withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan without congressional approval.\n\nIn March 2021, Perry was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat that overwhelmingly passed.\n\nIn July 2021, Perry voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed in the House 407\u201316.\n\nImmigration\nPerry voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.\n\nPerry voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).\n\nInvolvement with 2020 presidential election\nAfter the 2020 general election, Perry promoted false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn December 2020, Perry was one of 126 Republican House members to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Perry joined Missouri senator Josh Hawley in objecting to counting Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. During the storming of the U.S. Capitol that day, Perry and his congressional colleagues were ushered to a secure location.\n\nPerry reportedly played a role in a December 2020 crisis at the Justice Department in which Trump considered firing acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, the acting chief of the civil division of the DOJ. The New York Times reported Perry introduced Clark to Trump because Clark's \"openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud presented Mr. Trump with a welcome change from the acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who stood by the results of the election and had repeatedly resisted the president's efforts to undo them.\" Before the certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, Perry and Clark reportedly discussed a plan in which the Justice Department would send Georgia legislators a letter threatening an investigation into voter fraud and an invalidation of Georgia's electoral votes, even though the DOJ had investigated reports of fraud but found nothing significant, as attorney general Bill Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials and presented it to Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue. It claimed the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\" and urged the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors.\" Rosen and Donoghue rejected the proposal. In August 2021, CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe had briefed top Justice Department officials that no evidence had been found of any foreign powers' interference with voting machines. Clark was reportedly concerned that intelligence community analysts were withholding information and believed Perry and others knew more about possible foreign interference. Clark requested authorization from Rosen and Donoghue for another briefing from Ratcliffe, asserting hackers had found that \"a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2021, House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to Perry asking him to provide information about his involvement in the effort to install Clark as acting attorney general. Thompson believed Perry had been involved in the effort to install Clark, given previous testimony from former acting attorney general Rosen and his deputy Donoghue, as well as communications between Perry and Meadows. Perry declined the request the next day, asserting the committee was illegitimate. Among several text messages to Meadows the committee released on December 14 was one attributed to a \"member of Congress\" dated January 5 that read \"Please check your signal,\" a reference to the encrypted messaging system Signal. In his letter to Perry, Thompson mentioned evidence that Perry had communicated with Meadows using Signal, though Perry denied sending that particular text message.\n\nCommittee assignments \n Committee on Foreign Affairs\n Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation\n Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\n Subcommittee on Aviation\n Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials\n\nCaucus memberships\n Freedom Caucus\nSecond Amendment Caucus\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Congressman Scott Perry official U.S. House website\n Scott Perry for Congress\n \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1962 births\n21st-century American politicians\nAmerican Master Army Aviators\nLiving people\nMembers of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives\nMembers of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania\nMilitary personnel from California\nMilitary personnel from Pennsylvania\nNational Guard of the United States generals\nPennsylvania Republicans\nPennsylvania National Guard personnel\nSmeal College of Business alumni\nPeople from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania\nPeople from York County, Pennsylvania\nPoliticians from San Diego\nRecipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (United States)\nRepublican Party members of the United States House of Representatives\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army War College alumni", "machine_text": " Scott Perry (politician) Scott Perry (born August 8, 1958) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party who has served as the U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district since 2013.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Muzzleloader\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A muzzleloader is any firearm into which the projectile and the propellant charge is loaded from the muzzle of the gun (i.e., from the forward, open end of the gun's barrel). This is distinct from the modern (higher tech and harder to make) designs of breech-loading firearms. The term \"muzzleloader\" applies to both rifled and smoothbore type muzzleloaders, and may also refer to the marksman who specializes in the shooting of such firearms. The firing methods, paraphernalia and mechanism further divide both categories as do caliber (from cannons to small-caliber palm guns).\n\nModern muzzleloading firearms range from reproductions of sidelock, flintlock and percussion long guns, to in-line rifles that use modern inventions such as a closed breech, sealed primer and fast rifling to allow for considerable accuracy at long ranges.\n\nModern mortars use a shell with the propelling charge and primer attached at the base.  Unlike older muzzleloading mortars, which were loaded the same way as muzzleloading cannon, the modern mortar is fired by dropping the shell down the barrel where a pin fires the primer, igniting the main propelling charge.  Both the modern mortar and the older mortar were used for high angle fire.  However, the fact that the mortar is not loaded in separate steps may make its definition as a muzzleloader a matter of opinion.\n\nMuzzleloading can apply to anything from cannons to pistols but in modern parlance the term most commonly applies to black powder small arms. It usually, but not always, involves the use of a loose propellant (i.e., gunpowder) and projectile, as well as a separate method of ignition or priming.\n\nLoading\n\nIn general, the sequence of loading is to put in first gunpowder, by pouring in a measured amount of loose powder, historically mostly by using a powder flask (or powder horn), or by inserting a pre-measured bag or paper packet of gunpowder (called a cartridge) or by inserting solid propellant pellets. The gunpowder used is typically black powder or black powder substitutes like Pyrodex. Sometimes two types of gunpowder (and two flasks) were used consisting of finer priming powder for the flash pan and coarser powder for the main charge behind the ball. This was particularly the case with earlier muzzleloaders like matchlocks but appear to have been less common with flintlocks and was irrelevant with percussion locks since they used percussion caps rather than priming powder.\n\nWadding is made from felt, paper, cloth or card and has several different uses. In shotguns, a card wad or other secure wadding is used between the powder and the shot charge to prevent pellets from dropping into the powder charge and on top of the shot charge to hold it in place in the barrel. In smooth bore muskets and most rifles used prior to cartridges being introduced in the mid-to late nineteenth century, wadding was used primarily to hold the powder in place.\n  \nOn most naval cannons, one piece of wadding was used to hold the powder in place and served the purpose of creating a better seal around the shot. Another was used to act as a plug to stop the shot rolling out because of the swaying of the ship.\n\nThe use of cartridges with both gunpowder charge and ball, made up in batches by the shooter or a servant, was known from very early on, but until roughly around 1800 loading using a powder flask and a bag of balls was more common outside of the military. The measuring stage for the barrel charge of gunpowder could be avoided by carrying a number of pre-measured charges in small containers of wood, metal or cloth, often carried on a bandolier.  These were known by various names, including \"chargers\" or \"apostles\" as 12 were often carried.  For most of the time muzzleloaders were in use, a round ball and pre-measured powder charge could be carried in a paper or cloth wrapping.  The shooter would bite off the end of the paper cartridge with his teeth and pour the powder into the barrel followed by the ball encased in the paper wrapping.\n\nThe projectiles and wads were then pushed down into the breech with a ramrod until they were firmly seated on the propellant charge.  Priming powder could be carried in a separate priming flask and poured into the priming pan or a little powder from the cartridge was used, and the frizzen was pushed down to hold the priming powder in place. After the gunpowder and projectile or shot charge were placed in the barrel a ramrod was used to firmly pack everything down at the base of the barrel.  Then either a priming charge was placed in the priming pan or a percussion cap was placed on the nipple, the firing mechanism initiated; the cock or hammer was then cocked to make the firearm ready to fire.\n\nProjectile types and history\n\nMuzzleloading firearms generally use round balls, cylindrical conical projectiles, and shot charges.\n\nIn some types of rifles firing round ball, a lubricated patch (see Kentucky rifle) of fabric is wrapped around a ball which is slightly smaller than the barrel diameter.  In other types of round ball firing rifles, a ramrod and hammer is used to force the round ball down through the rifling.  When fired, either the lead ball or the wrapping grips the rifling and imparts spin to the ball which usually gives improved accuracy. In rifles firing Mini\u00e9 balls, the patch, often the paper wrapping from the cartridge, is used as an initial seal and to hold powder in place during loading.\n\nThe Mini\u00e9 ball replaced the round ball in most firearms, especially military, in the 1840s and 1850s.  It has a hollow base which expands to grip the rifling.  The combination of the spinning Mini\u00e9 ball and the consistent velocity provided by the improved seal gave far better accuracy than the smoothbore muzzleloaders that it replaced.\n\nModern usage\nWhen aiming for great accuracy, muzzle-loaders are usually cleaned (\"swabbed\") before reloading, so that there is no residue left in the barrel to reduce accuracy, though in competitions run by the international governing body, the MLAIC, this is prohibited for military rifle and musket events. However, in small arms muzzleloading rifles, swabbing is only done after every 5-10 shots.  Large caliber muzzle-loaders such as cannons are always swabbed between shots to prevent accidents caused by live sparks igniting the fresh charge of powder as it is being loaded.\n\nMuzzleloading\n\nMuzzleloading is the sport or pastime of firing muzzleloading guns. Muzzleloading guns, both antique and reproduction, are used for target shooting, hunting, historical re-enactment and historical research. The sport originated in the United States in the 1930s, just as the last original users and makers of muzzleloading arms were dying out. The sport received a tremendous boost in the 1960s and 1970s. The Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (www.MLAIC.org) was formed in 1970 and held its first World Championship in 1971. Since then a flourishing industry manufacturing working reproductions of historic firearms now exists in the United States and Europe, particularly in northern Italy, for example at Gardone Val Trompia, in the Province of Brescia. In the United States muzzleloading guns are, subject to a number of qualifications, generally not considered firearms. Subject to state law they may be possessed by persons who might otherwise not be legally allowed to own a firearm.\n\nThe American National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association holds two national tournaments a year in Friendship, Indiana as well as the Western National Shoot Event held in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (MLAIC) governs international competition with muzzle-loading arms.  The MLAIC holds a Short Range World Championship in even-numbered years and a Long Range World Championship (300 to 1000 yards) on odd numbered years (South Africa has won the last 5 Long Range World Championships).\n\nModern use\nDriven by demand for muzzleloaders for special extended primitive hunting seasons, firearms manufacturers have developed in-line muzzleloading rifles with designs similar to modern breech-loading centerfire designs. Knight Rifles pioneered the in-line muzzleloader in the mid-1980s, manufacturing and selling them to this day. Savage Arms has created the 10ML-II, which can be used with smokeless powder, reducing the cleaning required. However, Savage has discontinued the production of smokeless muzzleloaders and no company has yet to pick up production of a new smokeless muzzleloader.  There are several custom gun makers that are currently building smokeless muzzleloaders on new or donor bolt actions.\n\nSee also\n\nRelated to muzzle-loading small arms\n\nRelated to muzzle-loading artillery \n\nRifled muzzle loader\nList of muzzle-loading artillery\nBombard\nFalconet\nSaker\nCannon\nDemi-cannon\nCulverin\nDemi-culverin\nMinion\nCanon-obusier (gun-howitzer)\nML 8 inch shell gun\n68-pounder gun\nParrott rifle\n70 pounder Whitworth\nRML 68-pounder 64 cwt gun\nRML 7 inch gun\n68-pounder Lancaster gun\nRML 12 inch 25 ton gun\nRML 12 inch 35 ton gun\nRML 17.72 inch gun, (\"100-ton gun\")\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association\nMuzzle Loaders association of Great Britain\nMuzzle-Loading Associations International Committee\nMuzzleloader Articles A number of articles on loading and firing various military muzzleloaders.\n\n \nFirearm actions\nEarly firearms\nAmmunition\n19th-century weapons\n18th-century weapons\nBlack-powder pistols", "machine_text": " A muzzleloader is a firearm in which the gunpowder is loaded through the muzzle of the barrel. They were the earliest form of firearm, and remained in use long after the introduction of breech-loading firearms. The first true muzzleloaders were long guns with a touchhole at the rear of the barrel, which was sealed with a stopper or a leather disk until the gun was fired. To load, the gun was pointed upward, the stopper removed, powder poured in, then the stopper replaced. A paper or cloth disk called a \"wad\" was then inserted into the muzzle, followed by the bullet, which was usually a large round ball. The wad was used to prevent the powder from leaking out the bore during storage. In the 18th and 19th centuries, before the introduction of the percussion cap, muzzleloaders were the standard firearm. They were long-barrelled and often large-calibre weapons, and were particularly popular for use on the battlefield, where the large projectiles they fired could cause significant damage to enemy soldiers and defences. Muzzleloaders are loaded from the muzzle of the gun, which is the open end of the barrel. The powder and bullet are loaded from the front, and the percussion cap or flintlock mechanism is set into the breech (the back part of the gun). There are two main types of muzzleloaders: 1. Muzzleloading rifles These are similar to modern rifles, but are loaded from the muzzle. They often have a \"patch box\" built into the stock, which holds a small amount of gunpowder for priming the rifle. 2. Muzzleloading shotguns These are similar to modern shotguns, but are loaded from the muzzle. They are often used for hunting or sport shooting, and can be used to fire a variety of ammunition, including birdshot, buckshot, and slugs. Muzzleloaders require more skill to use effectively than modern firearms, as the user must manually load each round. They are also generally slower to load than breech-loading firearms, as the user must insert the powder and bullet through the muzzle, then seat the percussion cap or close the breech. However, muzzleloaders can be more accurate than breech-loading firearms, as there is no gas seal between the powder and the bullet, so the two components can fit more tightly together. Muzzleloaders are often used for historical reenactments, as they are accurate and authentic representations of early firearms. They are also used for hunting and sport shooting, as they can be loaded with a variety of ammunition to suit different game and shooting situations. In the United States, muzzleloaders are used for hunting large game such as deer, elk, and moose. They are also used for hunting small game, as well as for sport shooting and historical reenactments. Muzzleloaders are popular for hunting and sport shooting, as they are accurate and can be loaded with a variety of ammunition. They are also used for historical reenactments, as they are authentic representations of early firearms. The use of muzzleloaders for hunting is growing in popularity, as they are effective for taking down large game. They are also popular for hunting small game, as they can be loaded with birdshot or buckshot ammunition. Muzzleloaders are the basis for many shooting sports, including muzzleloading rifle, muzzleloading shotgun, and black powder shooting. In the United States, the National Muzzleloading Association is the main organization for muzzleloaders. It holds competitions and events for muzzleloaders, and promotes the use of muzzleloaders for hunting and sport shooting. Muzzleloaders are considered to be antiques in the United States, and are subject to special regulations for ownership and use. They must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), and are not allowed to be loaded with explosive powder. They can be loaded with black powder or Pyrodex, which are considered to be non-explosive powders. Muzzleloaders are considered to be environmentally friendly, as they do not use any modern chemicals or materials in their construction. They are also used for hunting, which can help to control the population of game animals. Muzzleloaders are considered to be one of the most authentic ways to experience early firearms. They are used for historical reenactments, and can be loaded with period-correct ammunition to represent the way they would have been used in the past. Muzzleloaders are used in many different shooting sports, including muzzleloading rifle, muzzleloading shotgun, and black powder shooting. In the United States, the National Muzzleloading Association is the main organization for muzzleloaders", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 94124}

This painting was inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi by the Ottoman forces in 1826, during which many people of the city after the long-time siege (almost a year) decided to attempt a mass breakout (sortie) to escape famine and epidemics. The attempt resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain.\n\nAnalysis\nGreece is depicted as a kneeling woman who occupies the major part of the painting. She is wearing a traditional Greek costume, her chest being widely bare, and she spreads her arms as a sign of sadness. The hand of a dead victim can be seen protruding from the rubble, beneath her feet. In the background, a dark-complexioned man wearing a yellow turban, who symbolizes the enemy, is planting a flag in the ground.\n\nThe painting borrows elements from Christianity. Indeed, \"Greece adopts the attitude of praying in the early centuries of Christianity.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jotabeche\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jotabeche is a Miocene-Pliocene caldera in the Atacama Region of Chile. It is part of the volcanic Andes, more specifically of the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). This sector of the Andean Volcanic Belt contains about 44 volcanic centres and numerous more minor volcanic systems, as well as some caldera and ignimbrite systems. Jotabeche is located in a now inactive segment of the CVZ, the Maricunga Belt.\n\nJotabeche formed from the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate, like the other volcanoes in the CVZ and the Andean Volcanic Belt. In the region of Jotabeche, during the late Miocene and Pliocene a change in the subduction geometry has caused volcanism to end, with volcanism shifting eastwards to the Incapillo volcanic centre. The crust beneath Jotabeche is  thick, which has had effects on the rock composition of the volcano.\n\nJotabeche has erupted two major ignimbrites between 8,500,000 and 5,900,000 years ago. The first ignimbrite was the larger one and is named Negro Francisco and the second is called Jotabeche proper. A caldera and some lava domes are also part of the complex. Volcanism ceased 5 million years ago.\n\nGeography and structure \nJotabeche is located at the extreme southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes. The Central Volcanic Zone is one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. In this belt, ongoing subduction of the Antarctica plate, Nazca plate and its precursor the Farallon plate are responsible for ongoing volcanic activity, including such volcanoes as Villarrica and Nevado del Ruiz. The Central Volcanic Zone sub-belt itself contains about 44 volcanic centres and over five major Quaternary caldera and ignimbrite complexes. The so-called Abancay deflection separates the CVZ in the north from the Peruvian flat subduction segment where no volcanic activity occurs, while the southern limit is marked by a seismic discontinuity around 27\u00b0 S.\n\nJotabeche is a  high volcano with a caldera. A rhyolitic dome formed inside of the caldera. The Jotabeche complex reaches a thickness of  when including ignimbrite, lava domes and lavas. The  high and  wide Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano is found northeast of Jotabeche and is surrounded by pyroclastic flows. The Santa Cecilia lava domes () have diameters of  and sit along a  long fault. The Miocene volcanic complex branches out in four chains stretching in east-west direction, the Cadillal, Aguas Blancas, Jotabeche Norte and Cordon de Yeguas Heladas. N-S to NE-SW trending faults border the volcanic complex and have allowed the intrusion of diorite porphyries. The resulting hydrothermally altered rocks are the sites of mineral deposits and prospects. These faults include the Yeguas Heladas, Rio La Gallina and Rio Astaburuaga and form a hexagonal structure which partly forms the margin of the caldera. Otherwise, only little erosion has taken place at Jotabeche; stronger erosion though has exposed a > thick hydrothermally altered complex at Aldebaran-Cerro Casale. Other hydrothermally altered areas are found within depressions. The crust beneath Jotabeche reaches a thickness of .\n\nGeology \nJotabeche is a volcanic centre in the 26-6 mya old and  long Maricunga belt. Some stratovolcanoes in the belt include Copiap\u00f3-Azufre, Cerros Bravos, Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, La Laguna, Lagunillas, Ojos del Maricunga, Santa Rosa and Cadillal-Yeguas Heladas. Volcanic activity in this belt has also generated porphyry deposits containing silver, gold and copper. This belt is bordered by graben and horst tectonic structures that have generated the Salar de Maricunga and the Laguna de Negro Francisco.\n\nJotabeche is located at the southern end of the Maricunga belt, which was active starting from the Oligocene until the Pliocene. The formation of this volcanic belt was influenced by the changes in the subduction of the Nazca plate, which included the shallowing of the subducting plate and the formation of the Puna plateau. Jotabeche, belonging to the fourth stage of Maricunga belt activity after the third stage of Copiapo, is the youngest eruption of the Maricunga belt, whose activity ended with the Jotabeche caldera forming eruption. Volcanism afterwards shifted eastwards. Jotabeche is one of the largest volcanoes in the Maricunga belt. Volcanic activity at Jotabeche is coeval with the last mineralization phase of the Vallecito system in the El Indio belt.\n\nLocal \nJotabeche is part of the so-called Cordillera de Darwin segment of the Andes. The basement in the area consists of various sedimentary-volcanic formations dating back to the Paleozoic Chinches formation but also including the Jurassic Lautaro formation and the Cretaceous Quebrada de Monardes formation. Of the volcanic formations, the Pantanoso rhyolitic formation of the Paleozoic and the thick andesitic-dacitic lava flows of the mesozoic Rio Aguas Blancas formation are the most important. During the Cretaceous, local extension formed a number of small faults in the area. The oldest of these sequences crops out east of Jotabeche at the Chilean-Argentine frontier.\n\nComposition \nJotabeche has generated rhyodacite rocks. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite is rhyolitic while the Jotabeche ignimbrite itself is of rhyodacitic composition. Specific  concentrations are 65\u201370% for Negro Francisco while the caldera complex has 68\u201372%. The Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano has a concentration of 60% and is considered to be hornblende andesite in terms of composition. Overall, all rocks fit the potassium-rich calc alkaline pattern. Gold-rich porphyry deposits are found on Jotabeche's flanks. Diorites are also found but the only weak erosion and thick late Miocene rock cover bury them. Other mineralizations are found between Jotabeche and the Salar de Maricunga.\n\nThe chemistry of Jotabeche ignimbrites is distinct from other Tertiary volcanic rocks in the Andes. The rocks of Jotabeche have lanthanum, strontium and yttrium concentrations which fit an eclogitic trend, similar to other Andean volcanoes Pircas Negras, Tortolas and Vallecito. More generally, the geochemistry is indicative of the volcanic activity being influenced both by a thick crust and other factors of crustal contamination. Other composition data are indicative of a drop in mantle water content above the shallowing slab. The crust above the Jotabeche ignimbrite source region was thick enough to permit the stability of garnet in said source region.\n\nGlaciation \nJotabeche does not currently display any perennial snow, only during summer is snow observed in the area. Likewise, rock glaciers are only found as fossil remnants. However, moraines are found at Jotabeche, and glaciers advanced north from a cirque on its northern flank into the Laguna de Negro Francisco, where a peninsula marks the position of the most extensive moraine.\n\nEruptive history \nJotabeche was active between 7 and 5 mya ago, spanning the late Miocene and Pliocene. The end of volcanic activity at Jotabeche occurred at the same time as the northeastern arm of the Juan Fernandez ridge passed beneath the volcano. After end of activity at Jotabeche volcanism occurred farther east at Incapillo. 15.3 \u00b1 0.8 and 17.2 \u00b1 0.7 mya the Las Gallinas ignimbrite formed east of Jotabeche, but its origin is unknown.\n\nThe Santa Cecilia domes of Jotabeche were active 24.3 \u00b1 0.7 mya and 24.1 \u00b1 0.8 mya based on potassium-argon dating of an eroded tuff ring. Between 18 and 16 mya the Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano was active in the region. Some rhyolitic lava domes intruded into the caldera are 10 mya old. The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted 8.5 mya ago and covers a surface area of  around the Laguna del Negro Francisco; it is the initial activity of Jotabeche. 5.9\u20136.2 mya the Jotabeche ignimbrite covered a surface area of . The Negro Francisco ignimbrite was erupted from a NW-trending fault and flowed between the Jotabeche Norte and La Laguna stratovolcanoes to the Laguna del Negro Francisco depression and across it. The so-called Pircas Negras andesitic lava flows occur at the same time as the younger Jotabeche activity. Andesitic-dacitic lava domes along the La Gallina fault are of the same age.\n\nAt Copiapo and Jotabeche, the volcanic activity has been subdivided in three phases, the first being the \"normal\" volcanic phase, a second phase with a drop in magma supply and the formation of more differentiated magmas in crustal magma chambers such as rhyolites and at the end the eruption of andesites along fractures.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Inspirations for James Bond\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A number of real-life inspirations have been suggested for James Bond, the fictional character created in 1953 by British author, journalist and Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming; Bond appeared in twelve novels and nine short stories by Fleming, as well as a number of continuation novels and twenty-six films, with seven actors playing the role of Bond.\n\nAlthough the stories and characters were fictional, a number of elements had a real-life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number\u2014007\u2014which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.\n\nApparently, inspiration for the James Bond spy novels may have come from the writings of William Le Queux; inspiration for the James Bond films may have come from the early silent films of German director Fritz Lang, including the Dr. Mabuse films, and the 1928 film Spione.\n\nOrigins of the name\n\nOn the morning of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".\n\nOn another occasion Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife, he described them as \"a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke\". The ornithologist was obliquely referred to in the film Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan's Bond picking up a copy of Birds of the West Indies and posing as an ornithologist.\n\nCharacter inspirations\n\nDominican playboy, diplomat, soldier, polo player and race car driver \"Porfirio Rubirosa\" was the main influence for the character according to lawyer and historian \"Daniel J. Voelker\"\nRubirosa was a man who made his mark for his international lifestyle, jetsetting and massive success with women, out of his five spouses, two of them were the richest women in the world at that time. Voelker wrote that Fleiming refrained from publicising his muse for fear that racism would harm the sale of the book, Rubirosa was from mixed racial background and Fleming's audience in the 1950s and early 60s may not have been accepting of such revelation, he also wrote that out of all the rumoured inspirations from the character only Rubirosa checks all the boxes, claiming the similarities between the par and uncanny, he brought comparisions between Fleming's and Rubirosa's lives, interests, lovers, admirers and cyrcle of friends over a 30 year old period and all of them seem to coincide.\n\nIn other interview, Voelker stated that:\n\u201cTwo of the main focal points can be found through internationally famous celebrities Errol Flynn and Noel Coward. Friends with both Fleming and Rubirosa, these two lived between Fleming and Rubirosa in the Caribbean, traveled and partied with both of them and even shared a \u2018love connection\u2019 through certain well known women, including Rita Hayworth and Eva Per\u00f3n.\u201d which can lead to another proof that character was inspired by the controversial man.\n\nDuring the Second World War Fleming was the personal assistant to the director of the Naval Intelligence Division, Admiral John Godfrey. He reached the rank of commander\u2014a rank he subsequently gave to his fictional creation\u2014and was the planner for special operations unit 30th Assault Unit. Many of Bond's tastes and traits were Fleming's own, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's, as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring his creator's. Fleming used the experiences of his espionage career and other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.\n\nBond's cigarettes were also the same as Fleming's, who had been buying his custom-made by Morland since the 1930s; Fleming added the three gold bands on the filter during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty-five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball. Fleming himself smoked up to eighty cigarettes a day. Apart from imbuing Bond with his own tastes, Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in intelligence, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".\n\nThe Institute of National Remembrance revealed in 2020 that James Albert Bond (1928 \u2013 2005), a British diplomat born in Bideford, Devon, had worked at the British Embassy in Warsaw with arrival of Warsaw on 18 February 1964 and left the territory of the Polish People's Republic on 21 January 1965. Released documents confirm that he conducted espionage activities. It is unclear whether Ian Fleming was aware of the existence of an actual spy named James Albert Bond. James Albert Bond had a son with his wife Janette Tacchi who is also called James, born in 1955.\n\nLiterary Inspirations\nBesides real life individuals, James Bond was also inspired by one of Dennis Wheatley's characters; the secret agent Gregory Sallust,  based on Wheatley's late friend Gordon Eric Gordon-Tombe. It is also said that the character of James Bond took inspiration from a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly and sophisticated spy by Somerset Maugham, using his own spying experience as a basis. Another inspiration for the James Bond spy novels may have come from the writings of William Le Queux.\n\nAs well, inspiration of James Bond films may have come from the early silent films of German director Fritz Lang, including the Dr. Mabuse films, and the 1928 film Spione.\n\nInspiration for \"007\"\nThe 007 number assigned to James Bond may have been influenced by any number of sources. In the films and novels, the 00 prefix indicates Bond's discretionary \"licence to kill\", in executing his duties. Bond's number\u2014007\u2014was assigned by Fleming in reference to one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code.\n\nOne of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and which was one of the factors that led to the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified and, as journalist Ben Macintyre has pointed out, \"to anyone versed in intelligence history, 007 signified the highest achievement of British military intelligence.\"\n\nJohn Dee, who was accused of spying for the crown, signed his letters to Elizabeth I, Queen of England between 1558 and 1603, with a \"007\" symbol, marking them thereby as personal \u2013 destined for her majesty's eyes only.\n\nSee also\n Outline of James Bond\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n Official website of Ian Fleming Publications\n\nJames Bond\nJames Bond lists\nBond, James", "machine_text": " Inspirations for James Bond The character of James Bond was partially inspired by real people. Several sources have been proposed as inspiration for the name and personality of the character; these include the author Ian Fleming's brother, Lieutenant Commander Fleming, and the journalist and mystery writer Raymond Chandler. In a 1952 letter to The Times, Fleming mentioned that he had once considered using the name James Bond for a character in a book, but had already used it in a short story that was published in the First World War. The character in the short story was based on Fleming's brother, who died in the war. Fleming's brother was an officer in the Royal Navy, and Fleming himself had briefly been a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the war. As a result, many of the characteristics of James Bond are inspired by the world of the British military. Fleming's own experiences also inspired aspects of the character. For example, the line \"shaken, not stirred\" was taken from a Fleming story about a gambling friend of his who would always say this when ordering a martini. In the novel Live and Let Die, Fleming used the name James Bond as a disguise for another character, a British agent whose real name is Tom Bond. In the story, Tom Bond is a black man who, like Fleming's brother, is killed in action. In addition to his brother, Fleming may have been inspired by other real-life individuals. For example, the character of M was inspired by Fleming's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division, Rear Admiral John Godfrey. The character of Moneypenny was inspired by a personal assistant of Fleming's, Olive Fawcett. Fleming used the names of several friends and colleagues for characters in his Bond novels, including the names of several members of the Kray twins' gang (for the characters of Tee Hee, Mr. Big, and Dr. Noah) in Live and Let Die.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1372579}

The term was coined by Japanese writer and researcher Kenji Mikuni. The Haboku sansui legend says that in Japan there exists a map seller who fraudulently sells a map that can never be deciphered by the buyer. The map is said to be sold for a very high price. The story goes that the seller will claim the map is very rare and that it provides the location of a treasure. The buyer will then be given the map, which is often old and dusty, and told that it can be deciphered with a certain method, such as using only the top right corner. However, after the buyer has paid for the map and leaves the shop, they are unable to make sense of the map using the method provided. When the buyer returns to the shop, the seller is nowhere to be found, and the buyer is left with a useless map. It is said that this legend is told as a cautionary tale to warn people of fraudulent sellers. However, the story is also used to convey a deeper meaning about life and how it can be full of uncertainty and confusion. In Japanese culture, it is believed that a person can never truly know the world around them and that there are always hidden truths that can never be discovered.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bruce Almighty\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk. The film stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck television reporter who complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. The film is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration, as they had worked together previously on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994 and Liar Liar in 1997. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall and Steve Carell.\n\nWhen released in American theaters on May 23, 2003, Bruce Almighty opened to mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success and grossed $85.9 million, making it the top Memorial Day opening weekend of any film in history at the time. The film surprised film pundits when it beat The Matrix Reloaded the following weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had made $242 million domestically and a total $484 million worldwide, making it Carrey's highest-grossing film worldwide, as well as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003.\n\nEvan Almighty, a spin-off sequel focusing on Steve Carell's character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, and Freeman also reprising his role, was released on June 22, 2007.\n\nPlot\n\nBruce Nolan is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. When Bruce is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter, he becomes furious and vents on live T.V.; his actions lead to him being fired from the station. Following a series of misfortunes, Bruce takes his anger out on God and complains that \"He's the one that should be fired\".\n\nBruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers to prove that He is doing the job correctly. God only gives Bruce two rules: he cannot tell others he has God's powers, nor can he use the powers to alter free will. Bruce is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain, such as exposing a woman's panties, getting his job back, and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. Bruce finds ways of using his powers around Buffalo to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the name \"Mr. Exclusive\". Bruce then causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. During this, Bruce continues to hear voices in his head. He later re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers, meant for God, that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to receive the prayers and respond but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle\u2014even though God has stated that Bruce is only receiving prayers from a section of the Buffalo area\u2014and sets the program to answer every prayer Yes automatically.\n\nBruce attends a party celebrating his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, after she forcefully comes on to him, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her, trying to use his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and finding they all won reducing their prize to a few dollars, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, who explains that He cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way himself. Bruce then goes about helping people without using his powers, including giving Evan his job back. As Bruce reads through the prayers on his computer, he finds several from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing to not be in love with him anymore.\n\nBruce is stunned and walks alone on a highway. Heartbroken, he asks God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and regains his consciousness in a white void. God appears, and He asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees and brings Bruce back to life. Bruce wakes up and finds himself in the hospital. Grace arrives shortly after. She and Bruce rekindle their relationship, and later become engaged. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to field reporting, and continues to report offbeat news stories.\n\nCast\n\n Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan\n Morgan Freeman as God\n Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly, Bruce's girlfriend\n Catherine Bell as Susan Ortega, Bruce's co-anchor\n Steve Carell as Evan Baxter (credited as Steven Carell), Bruce's rival\n Philip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor\n Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie Connelly, Grace's sister\n Paul Satterfield as Dallas Coleman\n Nora Dunn as Ally Loman\n Eddie Jemison as Bobby\n Sally Kirkland as Anita Mann\n Micah Stephen Williams as boy on bike\n Tony Bennett as himself\n Carlos S\u00e1nchez as Juan Valdez\n John Murphy as himself\n Madeline Lovejoy as Zoe\n Noel Gugliemi as Hector\n\nProduction\n\nFilming of Buffalo was done in the \"New York Street\" at Universal Studios Hollywood. The restaurant with Tony Bennett was filmed at Cicada, in the James Oviatt Building, downtown Los Angeles. The spa scene with Jennifer Aniston was filmed in the Shoin building at The Japanese Garden in Los Angeles.\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 48% based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle.\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, calling it: \"A charmer, the kind of movie where Bruce learns that while he may not ever make a very good God, the experience may indeed make him a better television newsman.\" Ebert praised Aniston's performance: \"Aniston, as a sweet kindergarten teacher and fiancee, shows again (after \"The Good Girl\") that she really will have a movie career.\"\n\nVarietys Robert Koehler gave the film a mixed review: \"There's remarkably little done with a premise snatched from high-concept heaven, adding yet another file to the growing cabinet of under-realized comedies.\"\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003, and topped the country's box office that weekend.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times gave it a negative review and called it \"not so mighty.\"\n\nControversies\nThe film was banned in Egypt because of its portrayal of God as an ordinary man. Bans in both Malaysia and Egypt were eventually lifted after the nations' censorship boards gave the film their highest rating (18-PL in the case of Malaysia).\n\nAs God contacts Bruce using an actual phone number rather than one in the standard fictional 555 telephone exchange, several people and groups sharing this number received hundreds of phone calls from people wanting to talk to God, including a church in North Carolina, US (where the minister was named Bruce), a pastor in northern Wisconsin and a man running a sandwich shop in Manchester, England. The producers noted that the number (776-2323) was not in use in the area code (716, which was never specified on screen) in the film's story, but did not check anywhere else. For the home-video and television versions of the film, the number was changed to the fictional 555\u20130123.\n\nSequel\nA sequel and spin-off, titled Evan Almighty, was released on June 22, 2007, with Steve Carell reprising his role as Evan Baxter and Morgan Freeman returning to his role as God. Although Shadyac returned to direct the sequel, neither Carrey nor Aniston was involved with the film, and Carrey's character, Bruce, is never mentioned in the film. The film was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nAccolades\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack was released on June 3, 2003, by Var\u00e8se Sarabande.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"ADAPT Act\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act () was introduced in the U.S. Congress on December 12, 2013 by Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia and fifty-two cosponsors. Responding to the lack of financial incentives for drug manufacturers to innovate new antibiotics and antifungals and the regulatory barriers to their doing so, it proposed an expedited pathway for testing drugs intended for diseases for which no cure yet existed. After it died in committee, a similar version of the Act was re-introduced by Representative John Shimkus of Illinois and his cosponsor Representative Gene Green of Texas. Though this Act likewise failed to make it out of committee, several of its provisions were codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. These include the expedited testing pathway for new antibiotics and a similar provision for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.\n\nBackground\n\nAntibiotic resistance and the barriers to new treatments\nThe cost of antibiotic resistance, in dollars and in lives, motivated the Act\u2019s sponsors and the community stakeholders that supported its passage. In September 2014, the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing at which officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pew Charitable Trusts, and other organizations testified in favor of the ADAPT and 21st Century Cures Acts. Opening the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Joseph R. Pitts (R-PA) quoted then-Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s recent admonition that failure to \u201cconfront the threat of antibiotic resistance\u201d could \u201ccast [humanity] back into the dark ages.\u201d Speaking at this same hearing, Representative Phil Gingrey (R-GA) (the 2013 Act\u2019s principal sponsor) referenced Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics, which placed the number of Americans who die from drug-resistant infections each year at around 23,000. Representative Gingrey asserted that the financial losses from such infections amount to $55 billion annually. Representative John Shimkus (R-IL) would later note these same figures in a House debate over the Acts in July 2015.\n\nEqually worrisome to the ADAPT Act\u2019s proponents were the economic and regulatory impediments to developing new treatments for drug-resistant illnesses. Citing the FDA, Representative Gingrey lamented during the 2014 hearing that \u201cnew antibiotic approval ha[d] decreased by 70 percent since the mid 1980s.\u201d Representative Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) likewise took issue with the \u201clack of a pipeline of new drugs\u201d to respond to the threat of super bugs. Several blamed inadequate market incentives for this paucity of remedies. As Dr. Barbara E. Murray, then-President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, observed, \u201cAntibiotics are typically priced low [and] used for a short duration.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies can reap greater returns in other areas of research; hence, the development of new antibiotics flounders.\n\nCompounding the scant financial motives for drug development, creators of new treatments were made to contend with \"serious regulatory barriers\". Dr. Murray observed that the small number of patients infected by novel diseases made it difficult for manufacturers to find enough test subjects in order to comply with federal agencies\u2019 n-count requirements. The unavailability of diagnostic tests for these new infectious agents also demanded a large investment to find eligible study participants, while generating little information about drug effectiveness. Stagnant innovation becomes self-perpetuating. The more antibiotics to which a pathogen becomes resistant, the fewer controls there are against which to measure an experimental treatment.\n\nThe GAIN Act\nIn 2012, one of Congress\u2019s earliest attempts at rectifying these barriers to new drug-resistant antibiotics came in the form of the Generating Antibiotics Now (GAIN) Act. GAIN was passed as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Its strategy for generating new antibiotics is to offer manufacturers an artificial monopoly on any qualifying drugs that they produce. Such drugs must treat illnesses with \u201cthe potential to pose a serious threat to the public health.\u201d However, beyond this blanket criterion, GAIN gave significant deference to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). This latitude was subject only to the requirements that she consider a given pathogen\u2019s \u201cimpact on public health\u201d and \u201cmorbidity and mortality rates\u201d and consult with the CDC, FDA, and the medical community. Manufacturers who satisfied GAIN\u2019s conditions were guaranteed five years of market exclusivity over the pertinent drug. These years could stack with the drug\u2019s \u201cfive year exclusivity as a new chemical entity (NCE), three year clinical investigation exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.\u201d Moreover, any qualifying drugs were eligible for fast-track review.\n\nGAIN\u2019s value proposition proved to be an effective one. As Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ) commented during the 2014 ADAPT Act hearing, within two years, GAIN had led to FDA approval of numerous new antibiotics. The expedited review procedure further ensured that these drugs would be \u201cable to combat an imminent infectious disease threat and reach patients at an accelerated pace\". At the same time, Representative Pallone and others were concerned about the consumer harms that these decades of exclusivity might yield. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) warned that exclusivity \u201callow[s drug companies] to charge higher prices,\u201d which \u201cimposes a significant burden on patients and on the healthcare system overall.\u201d To justify \u201cthe carrot of marketing and regulatory exclusivities,\u201d Representative Pallone exhorted his fellow members of Congress to ensure that their efforts \u201cachieve[] the necessary impact on the pipeline of new drugs.\u201d\n\nProvisions\n\nPurpose and Scope\nThe ADAPT Act complemented GAIN. Representative Gingrey introduced it to the House as the \u201clogical next step to the GAIN Act.\u201d To that end, it did not merely render the development of new treatments more lucrative but more feasible as well. The centerpiece of this proposal was ADAPT\u2019s creation of a Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway for certain antibiotics. Faced with a disease of sufficient severity for which alternatives do not yet exist, ADAPT would empower the Secretary to dispense with the usual testing requirements and allow manufacturers to go to market based on more limited efficacy tests. As Allan Coukell, Director of Drug, Medical Device, and Food Programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, observed, a patient with mutli-drug-resistant pneumonia will likely die without access to a new antibiotic. In that case, the uncertainty of an unproven remedy was preferable to the near certainty of death. In conducting such a risk-benefit assessment, ADAPT allowed the FDA to \u201caccept less data\u201d in approving a lifesaving drug. As Representative Shimkus later commended, this \u201cnew, streamlined pathway\u201d saved \u201cthousands of lives\u201d by making experimental drugs available to those who would otherwise have no cure.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in drugs approved via LPAD, ADAPT\u2019s advocates were careful to constrain its reach to \u201chigh-need populations\u201d suffering from the gravest threats. Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claimed that ADAPT would be restricted to \u201crare resistant organisms where there are really very few treatment options available.\u201d Within the population of patients affected by these diseases, the Act\u2019s application would be further constrained to \u201cthe limited population in most need of the therapy, as opposed to all patients.\u201d As such, ADAPT would not lower the federal review standard for new drugs, but merely contour it to the needs of \u201ca specific population that is different from the general population.\u201d\n\nRelationship Between the 2013 and 2015 Acts\nThe two versions of the ADAPT Act\u2014H.R. 3742 (2013) and H.R. 2629 (2015)\u2014contain the same three overriding provisions discussed above. Both would amend Section 505 of FD&C (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355) to formally include the expedited testing pathway. Each prescribes certain labeling requirements for manufacturers and charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with conducting the aforementioned breakpoint review. Under a modification to Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247b-22), the Secretary is also to monitor \u201cthe use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d as well as \u201c[c]hanges in bacterial and fungal resistance to drugs.\u201d This new responsibility of the Secretary encompasses drugs approved both through LPAD as well as the standard procedure. The results of the Secretary\u2019s resistance analysis, like the breakpoint research, are to be made public.\n\nThe 2013 and 2015 Acts differed slightly in scope and the precise process they envisioned. Under the 2013 Act, the Secretary could approve drugs to treat \u201ca limited population of patients for which there is an unmet need,\u201d based on her assessment of either traditional comprehensive studies, \u201cdatasets of limited size,\u201d \u201csuch other confirmatory evidence as [she] deems necessary,\u201d or some combination of the above. The 2015 version expands this list of sources of proof, holding that the Secretary may consult nonclinical tests\u2014assessments not conducted on humans\u2014in deciding on whether to approve a drug.\n\nAt the same time, this later version limited the Act\u2019s applicability via a purpose statement with language evocative of a sliding scale. The Act serves to \u201chelp expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections,\u201d but this goal depends on \u201cthe severity of the infection and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\u201d Furthermore, the 2015 Act contained a new precondition. In this version of the legislation, the Secretary did not simply decide what level of proof would be necessary for a drug\u2019s approval but actively collaborated with the manufacturer to create a \u201cwritten agreement\u201d that stipulated the necessary evidence. Only if such an agreement is reached may the Secretary approve the drug via the LPAD pathway. To the end of reaching this agreement, the 2015 Act provides for consultative meetings between manufacturers and the Secretary.\n\nIn regard to labeling, the 2013 Act would have mandated that LPAD drugs bear the warning label noted above: \u201cThis drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.\u201d However, on its terms, this requirement applied only to the drug\u2019s \u201cprescribing information\u201d\u2014not necessarily to its packaging or bottle. The 2015 Act broadened the labeling provision. In addition to the warning on prescriptions, this version entailed placing a label on the product itself that states \u201cLimited Population\u201d and features \u201cin a prominent manner . . . adjacent to . . . the brand name of the product.\u201d\n\nFinally, the 2015 version of the Act expanded its applicability relative to the prior version. For one, it allowed the Secretary to expand LPAD to new arenas outside its original superbug context. Should she determine \u201cthat the public health would benefit from expansion of the limited-use pathway,\u201d other medical areas may be subsumed within the Act\u2019s expedited provisions. Secondly, it pulls antimicrobial susceptibility tests into the LPAD pathway. So long as a given test satisfies the exigency conditions for antimicrobial drug treatments, \u201cthe Secretary may authorize the marketing of such device\u201d under LPAD\u2014subject to cautionary labeling requirements.\n\nLimitations\n\nKevin Khachatryan noted, that the ADAPT Act did not impose responsibilities for Antimicrobial stewardship for antibiotics developed under this pathway.\u201d Coupled with the incentive for manufacturers to produce all that they can during their monopoly window, \u201c[t]his can lead to overuse of these antibiotics and contribute to resistant microbes.\u201d Additionally, the Act placed a premium of speed while sidelining other objectives of testing, namely diverse representation among test subjects. This could impede the gathering of data about certain populations respond to experimental drugs, namely \u201cwomen, children, and [the] elderly.\u201d\n\nIncorporation into the 21st Century Cures Act \nThe day Representative Gingrey and fifty-two cosponsors introduced the ADAPT Act, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Health. It never left. A little over a year later, Representative Shimkus, joined by cosponsor Gene Green (D-TX), resuscitated the Act. Again, it died in committee. Nevertheless, \u201c[m]any of [its] provisions were ultimately incorporated into the 21st Century Cures Act [Cures Act].\" A bipartisan effort ranging from such varied policy areas as Medicare savings to tick-borne diseases, the Cures Act was signed into law three years and a day after the ADAPT Act\u2019s initial proposal.\n\nSection 3042 (concerning the \u201cexpedited testing of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs\u201d) of the Cures Act derives nearly verbatim from the 2015 ADAPT Act. At the request of a drug manufacturer, the Secretary may approve a given medication based on substandard data\u2014provided that it \u201cis intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs.\u201d However, in the vein of the 2015 ADAPT Act\u2019s purpose statement, Section 3042 requires the Secretary to balance the benefits of expedited remedies against their costs. Drugs approved under the Cures Act\u2019s LPAD pathway are subject to much the same labeling requirements as under the ADAPT Act. All labeling and advertising associated with such medications \u201cshall contain the statement \u2018Limited Population\u2019 in a prominent manner and adjacent to . . . the proprietary name of such drug.\u201d Section 3044 underscores the Secretary\u2019s ability to update and issue new susceptibility criteria for antimicrobial drugs and her requirement make this information public. Finally, Section 3043 includes similar language (relative to the 2015 ADAPT Act) in regard to the expedited production of new ASTs and their labeling requirements.\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States federal health legislation\nProposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress\nActs of the 114th United States Congress", "machine_text": " ADAPT Act The ADAPT Act is bi-partisan legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Todd Young (R-IN) on March 3, 2017.

Redondo left PAC and joined PINU to run for Congress, being elected.\n\nCongressional president and leadership dispute \nIn October 2021, the presidential candidates for PSH and LIBRE, Salvador Nasralla and Xiomara Castro, respectively, struck an alliance. Part of the agreement for Nasralla to step down as a candidate and endorse Castro was that if they were able to gain a majority in Congress, the speaker would be a member of the Savior Party. Castro's party won 50 seats, whilst Nasralla's party won 10. On December 23, during a livestream, Nasralla announced his endorsement for Luis Redondo to become the President of the Congress. The next morning, Castro followed suit. When the newly elected congress voted for a congressional president on 21 January 2022, 18 deputies from Castro's party refused to honour the agreement. Instead, they voted for Jorge C\u00e1lix, a member of LIBRE, rather than Redondo. Nasralla commented on the incident as \"another coup like in 2009\". As a consequence, the 18 deputies were expelled from LIBRE. The dispute was resolved when C\u00e1lix and the expelled deputies agreed to support Redondo. Their membership of LIBRE was restored by Castro.\n\nReferences\n\n1973 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Tegucigalpa\nPresidents of the National Congress of Honduras\n21st-century Honduran politicians", "machine_text": " Luis Redondo (born 24 September 1974) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a left-back.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Destiny Fulfilled\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Destiny Fulfilled is the fifth and final studio album by American R&B trio Destiny's Child. It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins as well as several new producers.\n\nFor the album's theme, the members drew inspiration from the conversations they had during the first week of recording when they discussed about the happenings in their lives while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an R&B album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.\n\nAs part of the album's promotion, the group performed songs from it on numerous award ceremonies and televised appearances in the US and Europe. They further embarked on the tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in 2005 with 67 dates across four continents worldwide. Destiny Fulfilled spawned four singles\u2014the lead single \"Lose My Breath\", \"Soldier\", \"Girl\" and \"Cater 2 U\". After the tour, the group disbanded.\n\nBackground \n\nWhile recording their third studio album Survivor in late 2000, Beyonc\u00e9 announced that Destiny's Child would eventually go on a hiatus that would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group. The idea of solo releases emanated from the group's manager, Beyonc\u00e9's father, Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child has been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to \"give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute\". During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would return to the studio in fall 2003 to start with the work on a new album.\n\nTwo members of the group, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland each released one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyonc\u00e9's had been regarded as the most successful with the release of Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fourth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.\n\nAfter this album, the group planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their solo careers. Beyonc\u00e9 has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyonc\u00e9 has said that \"the group felt it still had something to offer musically\" with the album before adding: \"We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.\". Rowland commented: \"We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record\". Beyonc\u00e9, also commented regarding the finality of their career: \"Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10\u00a0years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"\n\nProduction and recording \nProduction of the album began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from frequent collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within a period of three weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quality time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.\n\nDiffering from Survivor in that previously Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads\u2014which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyonc\u00e9 elaborated \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\" As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: \"All of us have been in three different places\u00a0... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"\n\nComposition \nDuring an interview with MTV, Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\" For the music of the album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R&B concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased \"the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically\". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.\n\nThe album opens with the up-tempo dance song \"Lose My Breath\", a track detailing a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums and keyboard stabs and the backing track contains various sound effects. \"Soldier\", the second track with T.I. and Lil Wayne, the only featured artists on the album, contains elements from Southern hip hop and Crunk&B. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from the opening song, the protagonists ask for a decent soldier, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding the soldier, the third song, the R&B number \"Cater 2 U\", lyrically is about submissively serving the man considered as such. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.\n\nThe fourth song \"T-Shirt\" is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their man's T-shirt, \"craving his presence, and inhailing his scent\". \"Is She the Reason\" is an R&B ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song \"I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To\". The next song, \"Girl\" was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. \"If\", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. \"Free\" was described as a \"soul classic from 1975\" with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being \"set free\" after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number \"Through with Love\" was noted for having an \"angry\" nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In \"Love\", \"capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment\", as the group \"thank[s] God for love\". They further sing about how people \"can't truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]\". They further proclaim that they have found love and are \"madly in it\".\n\nRelease and promotion \n\nThe track listing of Destiny Fulfilled was revealed on October 15, 2004. The album was first released in Japan on November 10, 2004. It was released on November 16, 2004, in North America via Columbia Records. Although the original release was intended to be one day earlier, Columbia Records was concerned about \"potential for Internet leaks and 'burned' CD counterfeits\" that could \"lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album\" which led to the postponement of Destiny Fulfilled.\n\nThe group performed \"Lose My Breath\" on ABC's 2004 National Football League \"Opening Kickoff\" special after its online release on September 9, 2004, to break their yearlong hiatus. On October 25, 2004, they appeared at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas performing the song with an a cappella jazz opening. The following month they performed three songs from their previous albums and finished with \"Lose My Breath\" on The Oprah Winfrey Show where they also sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey. On November 8, 2004, the trio appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) and performed the song along with \"Say My Name\". They went to the German entertainment TV show Wetten, dass..? on November 13, 2004, and performed \"Lose My Breath\". At BET's 106 & Park Destiny's Child performed \"Soldier\" on November 15, 2004. They also performed the song on CBSs The Early Show on December 8, 2004. In early February 2005 they gave another performance of \"Soldier\" at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, 2005, they sang both \"Soldier\" and \"Lose My Breath\". They performed the latter song again at the 2005 ESPY Awards on July 13 with the ceremony being aired on ESPN four days later. \"Cater 2 U\" was performed on June 28 during the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen the advanced release date of the album was announced, the group confirmed the initial dates of their worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It in connection with Destiny Fulfilleds promotion. Promotions of the tour were aired over the radio and television across the United States and the group further collaborated with McDonald's, which served as its sponsor. The tour's set list included songs from Destiny Fulfilled as well as Destiny's Child's previous albums and songs from the solo albums of each member performed individually. Numerous costume changes occurred throughout the show; the concert exhibited products from Beyonc\u00e9's clothing line from the House of Der\u00e9on, a company she co-founded with her mother Tina Knowles. A performance from the tour was filmed in Atlanta on July 15, 2005, and the DVD Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta chronicling the concert was released on March 28, 2006.\n\nSingles \nThe album's lead single, \"Lose My Breath\", premiered on AOL Music on September 9, 2004, and it was released on  September 21. Its high-mark debut at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to its release gave the album an early boost. The single peaked at number three on the chart for the week ending November 6, 2004 giving the group their ninth top ten single. \"Lose My Breath\" topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending January 8, 2005 and was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 28, 2005, selling 500,000 copies in the US. It was also successful across Europe, peaking at number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart for the week ending December 4, 2004 spending four consecutive weeks on top. It managed to top the charts in Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland and it further appeared in the top ten in almost every other chart. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) used the song as the music for their introductory montage at the 2004 NBA Playoffs and through the first few weeks of the 2005 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\"Soldier\", released on December 7, 2004, peaked at the third position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the band's tenth top ten single on that chart. It further became the second single from the album to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending February 26, 2005. The RIAA gave it a gold certification for selling 500,000 digital copies in the US. \"Soldier\" further peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number 3 on the ARIA Charts in Australia and appeared in the top 20 in many European countries. The third single from the album, \"Girl\" was released on May 2, 2005, in the UK and on May 17 in the US. It was successful on the ARIA Chart peaking at number five and number six both on the UK Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart in addition to appearing in other European charts. In the US, it peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart becoming the lowest charting single there from the album. The fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled was \"Cater 2 U\" released in the US and Italy only beginning on June 14, 2005. It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs further being certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nOther songs\n\"Got's My Own\" was released a promotional single on May 3, 2005.\n\nCritical reception \n\nDestiny Fulfilled received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews. Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe magazine complimented the production of the album, saying that it \"showcases advanced production values\" with \"impressive\" songwriting and vocal abilities and concluded that it \"offers divine satisfaction\". A writer of Billboard felt that Destiny Fulfilled worked as \"a testament to Beyonc\u00e9's evolving multiple talents\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland's and Williams' abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyonc\u00e9 \"steals every song on Destiny Fulfilled\" further commending her for sounding \"larger than life even when she's quiet\"; however he concluded, \"as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment\". Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club wrote in his review that \"Destiny Fulfilled sounds distant and detached\" further criticizing its mid-tempo ballads for sounding \"uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst\". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times commented that it is \"a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence\". Alan Ranta of Tiny Mix Tapes doubted Beyonc\u00e9's lyrical sincerity, saying, \"the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans' disbelief that Beyonc\u00e9 'Your Ad Here' Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.\"\n\nCaroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented that the lead vocals of the songs were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a \"democratic\" one; however she criticized them for squandering \"the extent of their talents\" on the album. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly also noticed its \"overall air of democracy at work\" and noted that Destiny Fulfilled \"often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads\". Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone magazine echoed his comments, saying, \"In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams\". She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, \"the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&B ballads where the only saving grace is\u00a0... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.\" Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has commented that the ballads of the album build into \"the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks\". Most of the critics questioned why Beyonc\u00e9 had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most success among the members of the group. Henderson lambasted Beyonc\u00e9 to performing again with the group with the \"full intention\" of taking advantage to bolster her \"divette\" status to superstardom. In May 2006, Destiny Fulfilled was listed at number 24 on a list titled \"The 50 Worst Albums Ever!\" compiled by Q magazine.\n\nAccolades \nThe album won in the category for Favorite Soul/R&B Album at the 2005 American Music Awards where Destiny's Child also won the Favorite Soul/R&B Band award. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards Destiny Fulfilled received an award for Best R&B/Soul Album while \"Soldier\" received Best R&B/Soul Single. The album was nominated in the category for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006 but it lost to Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi. Its singles \"Soldier\" and \"Cater 2 U\" further received nominations in three different categories at the same ceremony. The previous year, \"Lose My Breath\" was nominated in the category for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nCommercial performance \n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 for the week ending November 27, 2004 for amassing sales of 61,000 copies prior to a whole tracking week. In its first official week of sales, Destiny Fulfilled sold over 497,000 copies, with an increase of 713% compared to its early sales; the album's chart position rocketed to number two on the Billboard\u00a0200 for the week ending December 4, 2004. In the same week, it debuted at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart becoming the group's second chart topper following Survivor in 2001. After being removed from the top position for three consecutive weeks, Destiny Fulfilled returned to number one for the week ending January 1, 2005. On January 14, 2005, it was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 3,000,000 copies. It emerged as the seventh best-selling album and third best-selling R&B album in 2005. As of October 2009, the album has sold 3.1 million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was ranked at number 133 on the decade-end chart of the best-selling albums in that country for the period between 2000 and 2009. The album peaked at number 3 on the Canadian Albums Chart and was awarded Platinum certification by Music Canada selling 100,000 copies.\n\nIn the UK, Destiny Fulfilled debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart on November 27, 2004, which also became its peak position in that country.

The episode was directed by James L. Conway and written by David A. Goodman and John Shiban. It was first broadcast on UPN on May 26, 2004. The Enterprise crew attempt to find a planet to serve as a new home for the Vulcans, after a massive eruption destroys the planet and its inhabitants. In the process, the crew discovers a hidden NASA facility on the planet, which was used to develop the warp drive. With the Vulcans' future now in the hands of the Enterprise crew, Captain Archer must decide what is best for both the Vulcans and humanity. The episode was the final episode of the series, as the show was cancelled after this episode. A novelization by Diane Carey, published by Pocket Books, was released in July 2004, in which the story is expanded to include a subplot in which the crew deals with the loss of Captain Archer's dog, Porthos. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 4.99 million viewers, which was at the time the lowest number of viewers for any episode in the series. The episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and Outstanding Makeup for a Series (non-prosthetic). The two-hour season finale was released as a single-episode DVD on June 15, 2004, and was released as part of the season three DVD set on September 27, 2005. This episode is noted for its numerous references to the original Star Trek series, including the re-use of the classic Star Trek episode \"The Doomsday Machine\" as well as the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\". The episode begins with the Enterprise answering a distress call from the Vulcans. The Vulcans are conducting a religious ceremony in which they are to sacrifice themselves to their god, the red-giant sun of their planet. When the Enterprise arrives, they are too late. The Vulcans have already jumped into the sun, and their planet is destroyed in the process. The Enterprise crew then begins a search for a new planet to serve as a new home for the Vulcans. In the process, they discover a hidden NASA facility on the planet, which was used to develop the warp drive. The Vulcans had discovered the facility and were using it to conduct their religious ceremonies. With the Vulcans' future now in the hands of the Enterprise crew, Captain Archer must decide what is best for both the Vulcans and humanity. He ultimately decides to allow the Vulcans to remain on their new planet, and to continue their traditions.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 972631}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Auguste Rodin\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Ren\u00e9 Rodin (12 November 184017 November 1917) was a French sculptor generally considered the founder of modern sculpture. He was schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work. Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, and deeply pocketed surface in clay. He is known for such sculptures as The Thinker, Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell.\n\nMany of Rodin's most notable sculptures were criticized, as they clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modeled the human body with naturalism, and his sculptures celebrate individual character and physicality. Although Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, he refused to change his style, and his continued output brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.\n\nFrom the unexpected naturalism of Rodin's first major figure \u2013 inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy \u2013 to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, his reputation grew, and Rodin became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His student, Camille Claudel, became his associate, lover, and creative rival. Rodin's other students included Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, and Charles Despiau. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.\n\nBiography\n\nFormative years\nRodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age 10. Between ages 14 and 17, he attended the Petite \u00c9cole, a school specializing in art and mathematics where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections, and Rodin expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite \u00c9cole that he met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.\n\nIn 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Entrance requirements were not particularly high at the Grande \u00c9cole, so the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. He left the Petite \u00c9cole in 1857 and earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.\n\nRodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of peritonitis in a convent in 1862, and Rodin was anguished with guilt because he had introduced her to an unfaithful suitor. He turned away from art and joined the Catholic order of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and sensed his lack of suitability for the order, so he encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. Rodin returned to work as a decorator while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail and his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion significantly influenced Rodin.\n\nIn 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he stayed for the rest of his life, with varying commitment. The couple had a son named Auguste-Eug\u00e8ne Beuret (1866\u20131934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the French National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family, as poverty was a continual difficulty for him until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked him to join him in Belgium, where they worked on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.\n\nRodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop since he could not afford castings. His relationship with Carrier-Belleuse had deteriorated, but he found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of Donatello and Michelangelo. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction. Rodin said, \"It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture.\" Returning to Belgium, he began work on The Age of Bronze, a life-size male figure whose naturalism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheatingits naturalism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.\n\nArtistic independence\n\nRose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. Charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.\n\nRodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural pieces in the style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.\n\nIn 1880, Carrier-Belleuse\u00a0\u2013 then art director of the S\u00e8vres national porcelain factory\u00a0\u2013 offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.\n\nThe artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer L\u00e9on Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.\n\nRodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.\n\nIn 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor Alfred Boucher in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions as well as creating her own works. Her Bust of Rodin was displayed to critical acclaim at the 1892 Salon.\n\nAlthough busy with The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.\n\nIn 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's \"double life\". Claudel and Rodin shared an atelier at a small old castle (the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Islette in the Loire), but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, \"I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.\"\n\nClaudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and brother that she was sane.\n\nWorks\n\nIn 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken Nose, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighborhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece was not a traditional bust, but instead the head was \"broken off\" at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the \"unfinishedness\" that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.\n\nEarly figures: the inspiration of Italy\nIn Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.\n\nIn 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics\u00a0\u2013 commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event\u00a0\u2013 and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work The Vanquished, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on The Age of Bronze, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin's words, \"man arising from nature\". Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind \"just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject\".\n\nIts mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so naturalistic that Rodin was accused of surmoulage\u00a0\u2013 having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to \"a statue of a sleepwalker\" and called it \"an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type\". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs\u00a0\u2013 what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.\n\nA second male nude, St. John the Baptist Preaching, was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of surmoulage by making the statue larger than life: St. John stands almost . While The Age of Bronze is statically posed, St. John gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground\u00a0\u2013 a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, \"display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively\".\n\nDespite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.\n\nRegardless of the immediate receptions of St. John and The Age of Bronze, Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of surmoulage. The artistic community knew his name.\n\nThe Gates of Hell\n\nA commission to create a portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.\n\nHe conceived The Gates with the surmoulage controversy still in mind: \"...I had made the St. John to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined...to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life.\" Laws of composition gave way to the Gates''' disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin's meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.The Gates of Hell comprised 186 figures in its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and The Prodigal Son.The Thinker (originally titled The Poet, after Dante) was to become one of the best-known sculptures in the world. The original was a  high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the Gates' lintel, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While The Thinker most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical Adam, the mythological Prometheus, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of The Thinker, stressing the figure's rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.\n\nThe Burghers of Calais\n\nThe town of Calais had contemplated a historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the army of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.\n\nRodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart. Though the town envisioned an allegorical, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.\n\nIn 1889, The Burghers of Calais was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing , and its figures are  tall. The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could \"penetrate to the heart of the subject\". At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.\n\nThe committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.\n\nCommissions and controversy \n\nCommissioned to create a monument to French writer Victor Hugo in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of artist and muse. Like many of Rodin's public commissions, Monument to Victor Hugo was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, The Times in 1909 expressed that \"there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers\". The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe\u00a0\u2013 a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work\u00a0\u2013 to express courage, labor, and struggle.\n\nWhen Balzac was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 rejected the work, and the press ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, \"there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang.\" A modern critic, indeed, claims that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.\n\nThe monument had its supporters in Rodin's day; a manifesto defending him was signed by Monet, Debussy, and future Premier Georges Clemenceau, among many others. In the BBC series Civilisation, art historian Kenneth Clark praised the monument as \"the greatest piece of sculpture of the 19th Century, perhaps, indeed, the greatest since Michelangelo.\" Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail.\n\nOther works\n\nThe popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.\n\nPortraiture was an important component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).\n\nLater, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician George Wyndham (1905), Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906), socialist (and former mistress of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII) Countess of Warwick (1908), Austrian composer Gustav Mahler (1909), former Argentine president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1911).\n\nHis undated drawing Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head is one of the works seized in 2012 from the collection of Cornelius Gurlitt.\n\nAesthetic\n\nRodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.\n\nRodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in The Thinker is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of The Thinker, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: \"What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.\"\n\nSculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments\u00a0\u2013 perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head\u00a0\u2013 took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.\n\nRodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. \"Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.\" Charles Baudelaire echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer Gluck, and wrote a book about French cathedrals. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized Van Gogh, and admired the forgotten El Greco.\n\nMethod\nInstead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: \"While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.\"\n\nHe described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through \"all the stages of art's evolution\": first, a \"Byzantine masterpiece\", then \"Bernini intermingled\", then an elegant Houdon. \"The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of Elan Vital. The Hand of God is his own hand.\"\n\nAfter he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as The Thinker), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.\n\nSince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.\n\nAs Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold The Walking Man (1899\u20131900), which was exhibited at his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio\u00a0\u2013 a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 St. John the Baptist Preaching he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.\n\nWithout finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices\u00a0\u2013 along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-naturalistic surface\u00a0\u2013 that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.\n\nLater years (1900\u20131917)\n\nBy 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.\n\nRilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such guests as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. A British journalist who visited the property noted in 1902 that in its complete isolation, there was \"a striking analogy between its situation and the personality of the man who lives in it\". Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the H\u00f4tel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.\n\nUnited States\n\nWhile Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of The Burghers of Calais, he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. However, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846\u20131924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849\u20131918).\n\nThe next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was beaucoup moins beau que l'original but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, Cupid and Psyche, Sphinx and Andromeda. All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.Bust of Dalou and Burgher of Calais were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier Charles Yerkes (1837\u20131905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.\n\nOther collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840\u20131924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell. In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor's life. After Hallowell's death, her niece, the painter Harriet Hallowell, inherited the Rodins  and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.\n\nGreat Britain\nAfter the start of the 20th century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist Alphonse Legros, had introduced him to the poet William Ernest Henley. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain. (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a bust of Henley that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)\n\nThrough Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom he found further support. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.\n\nAfter the revitalization of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president. In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers. He replaced its former president, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, upon Whistler's death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of Albert Ludovici, father of English philosopher Anthony Ludovici, who was private secretary to Rodin for several months in 1906, but the two men parted company after Christmas, \"to their mutual relief.\"\n\nDuring his later creative years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.\n\nFifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. They married on 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February. Rodin was ill that year; in January, he suffered weakness from influenza, and on 16 November his physician announced that \"congestion of the lungs has caused great weakness. The patient's condition is grave.\" Rodin died the next day, age 77, at his villa in Meudon, \u00cele-de-France, on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nA cast of The Thinker was placed next to his tomb in Meudon; it was Rodin's wish that the figure served as his headstone and epitaph. In 1923, Marcell Tirel, Rodin's secretary, published a book alleging that Rodin's death was largely due to cold, and the fact that he had no heat at Meudon. Rodin requested permission to stay in the Hotel Biron, a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.\n\nLegacy\nRodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the H\u00f4tel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order L\u00e9gion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.\n\nRodin restored an ancient role of sculpture\u00a0\u2013 to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject\u00a0\u2013 and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women\u00a0\u2013 to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.\n\nRodin had enormous artistic influence. A whole generation of sculptors studied in his workshop. These include Gutzon Borglum, Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, Camille Claudel, Charles Despiau, Malvina Hoffman, Carl Milles, Fran\u00e7ois Pompon, Rodo, Gustav Vigeland, Clara Westhoff and Margaret Winser, even though Brancusi later rejected his legacy. Rodin also promoted the work of other sculptors, including Aristide Maillol and Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 whom Rodin once called \"the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors.\" Other sculptors whose work has been described as owing to Rodin include Joseph Csaky, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Bernard, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Jacques Lipchitz, Pablo Picasso, Adolfo Wildt, and Ossip Zadkine. Henry Moore acknowledged Rodin's seminal influence on his work.\n\nSeveral films have been made featuring Rodin as a prominent character or presence. These include Camille Claudel, a 1988 film in which G\u00e9rard Depardieu portrays Rodin, Camille Claudel 1915 from 2013, and Rodin, a 2017 film starring Vincent Lindon as Rodin. Furthermore, the Rodin Studios artists' cooperative housing in New York City, completed in 1917 to designs by Cass Gilbert, was named after Rodin.\n\nForgeries\nThe relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.\n\nTo deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts\u00a0\u2013 the maximum number that can be made from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.\n\nIn the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8\u00a0million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze \u00c8ve, grand modele\u00a0\u2013 version sans rocher sold for $18.9\u00a0million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture\u00a0\u2013 especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.\n\nA number of drawings previously attributed to Rodin are now known to have been forged by Ernest Durig.\n\n Citations \n\n General sources \n\n (Online Essay)\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n Corbett, Rachel (2016).

Born in 1840, Rodin studied at the Petite \u00c9cole, then at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he was a student of Louis David. He and his companion, Rose Beuret, had a son in 1864, but he died after only a few days. In the late 1860s, Rodin took a studio in Paris and began working on The Gates of Hell, a major sculpture that was to occupy him for the next 30 years. The Thinker, originally titled The Poet, was begun in 1880 and presented to the Salon in Paris the following year, where it was given the title The Thinker. It was later purchased by the French government for 5,000 francs and placed in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. The Kiss was originally titled The Embrace and was intended to be part of a larger work, The Gates of Hell. It was later sold as a separate work and purchased by the British government in 1907. It is now in the Tate Gallery in London. The Gates of Hell, which was never completed, is now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. Rodin's works were often critical of the conventional morality of the time. The Gates of Hell, for example, features various figures in hell, including a pair of lovers who have been damned for their adultery. Rodin died in 1917. His works are among the most popular exhibits in the world, and many of them have been reproduced as statues, paintings, and prints.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2065}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ulnar collateral ligament injuries can occur during certain activities such as overhead baseball pitching. Acute or chronic disruption and/or attenuation of the ulnar collateral ligament often result in medial elbow pain, valgus instability, neurologic deficiency, and impaired throwing performance. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatment options.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nPain along the inside of the elbow is the main symptom of this condition. Throwing athletes report it occurs most often during the acceleration phase of throwing. Closing the hand and clenching the fist has also been shown to reproduce the painful symptoms. The injury is often associated with an experience of a sharp \u201cpop\u201d in the elbow, followed by pain during a single throw.  In addition, swelling and bruising of the elbow, loss of elbow range of motion, and a sudden decrease in throwing velocity are all common symptoms of a UCL injury. If the injury is less severe, pain can be minimal with complete rest.\n\nCauses\nThe UCL is important because it stabilizes the elbow from being abducted. If intense or repeated bouts of valgus stress occur on the UCL, injury will most likely transpire. Damage to the ulnar collateral ligament is common among baseball pitchers and javelin throwers because the throwing motion is similar. Physicians believe repetitive movements, especially pitching in baseball, cause adolescents' UCL injuries. Furthermore, physicians have stated that if an adolescent throws over 85 throws for 8 months or more in a year, or throw when exhausted, the adolescent has a significantly higher risk of succumbing to a UCL surgery. Gridiron football, racquet sports, ice hockey and water polo players have also been treated for damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. Specific overhead movements like those that occur during baseball pitching, tennis serving or volleyball spiking increase the risk of UCL injury. During the cocking phase of pitching, the shoulder is horizontally abducted, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed. There is slight stress on the UCL in this position but it increases when the shoulder is further externally rotated. The greater the stress the more the UCL is stretched causing strain. During the overhead throwing motion, valgus stress on the medial elbow occurs during arm cocking and acceleration. The initiation of valgus stress occurs at the conclusion of the arm-cocking phase. In the transitional moment from arm cocking to arm acceleration, the shoulder vigorously rotates internally, the forearm is in near full supination, and the elbow flexes from 90\u00b0 to approximately 125\u00b0. From late cocking to ball release, the elbow rapidly extends from approximately 125\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 at ball release. This causes tremendous valgus stress and tensile strain on the UCL. Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament are believed to result from poor throwing mechanics, overuse, high throwing velocities, and throwing certain types of pitches, such as curveballs. Poor mechanics along with high repetition of these overhead movements can cause irritation, micro-tears or ruptures of the UCL.  Kinetic chain dysfunction due to poor lower extremity strength, core strength and stability can be associated with UCL injuries as well as capsular stiffness in glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), and scapular dyskinesis. Injuries to the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in baseball players are rarely due to one-time, traumatic events. Rather, they are more often due to small chronic tears that accumulate over time.\n\nAnatomy\n\nThe ulnar collateral ligament (UCL, also known as medial collateral ligament) is located on the medial side of the elbow. The UCL complex comprises three ligaments: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments. The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial epicondyle to the medial ulnar surface slightly below the coronoid process. It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against valgus stress at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial semilunar notch. It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon. Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint\u2019s stability.\n\nDiagnosis\nIn most cases, a physician will diagnose an ulnar collateral ligament injury using a patient\u2019s medical history and a physical examination that includes a valgus stress test. The valgus stress test is performed on both arms and a positive test is indicated by pain on the affected arm that is not present on the uninvolved side.  Physicians often utilize imaging techniques such as ultrasound, x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging or arthroscopic surgery to aid with making a proper diagnosis.\n\nClassification\nA slow and chronic deterioration of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to repetitive stress acting on the ulna.  At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete\u2019s career.  The repetitive stress placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting in the loss of structural integrity over time.  The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury.  The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in flexion such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football.  The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow.  This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the radioulnar joints.\n\nTreatments\n\nUCL injuries may or may not require surgery.  Non surgical treatment will primarily focus on strengthening the elbow joint to regain strength and stability. First a course of \nRICE (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling.  When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL. These may include biceps curls (non resistance and resistance), pronating and supinating the forearm, and grip strengthening exercises, performed with low resistance and moderate repetitions no more than three times a week.\n\nSurgical treatment may help restore the ability to perform the overhand throwing motions most commonly associated with UCL injuries. The reconstructive surgery, generally known as Tommy John surgery, was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and has modified several times over the past 30 years. The surgery involves an autograft of the palmaris longus tendon (mostly seen as an accessory tendon) or an allograft of tissue from a cadaver or donor.  The new tendon is attached by drilling holes in the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the sublime tubercle of the ulna and lacing the tendon through them in a figure eight. The patient may begin physical therapy shortly after. It usually takes about 15 months after the surgery for standard rehabilitation. Rehabilitation following UCL injuries or surgery should follow a sequential and progressive multi-phased approach that involves a gradual and protected return of range-of-motion (ROM). The rehab program should include proprioceptive exercises to stimulate mechanoreceptors as well as arm strengthening, emphasizing proximal scapular stabilization. Low-resistance, high-repetition programs promote an optimal return to uncompensated throwing.  Post-operative treatment is related to the restoration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm, which begins with establishing trunk stability, elbow range of motion and strength as well as balance exercises.\u00a0  In study conducted by Dr. Frederick Azar, 78 Tommy John surgeries were performed and analyzed after the surgeries. Of the 78 patients, 8 of them (8.8%) reported complications. Two patients had superficial infections that resolved with oral antibiotics, two patients reported tightness of tenderness at the surgery site, and one had a superficial wound infection at the elbow incision that resolved with oral antibiotics. One patient developed postoperative ulnar nerve damage. Two patients had damages to the posteromedial part of the olecranon and required to have reoperation.\n\nRecent studies have shown that MLB pitchers who undergo Tommy John surgery return to pitch in the MLB 83% of the time and only 3% fail to return to pitch in the MLB or the minor league.\n\nRecently, there has been a recorded increase of Tommy John surgery. The increase is related to the false perception that the surgery improves the stability of the UCL joint. Many athletes believe in this false perception and cause them to lie about their symptoms in hopes to undergo the surgery. In order to combat these rumors, physicians are motivated to educate the public that Tommy John surgeries are only for those who have severe UCL injuries. The surgery will have an insignificant effect if the patient does not have a severe UCL injury.\n\nThe tendon chosen is then woven in a figure eight pattern through the humerus and ulna, which holes were first drilled in the bones. After surgery occurs, rehabilitation comes into place and usually takes about a year  because a tendon needs time to convert into a ligament.\n\nEpidemiology\nAccording to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, in 2008 the U.S. listed the diagnosis code for UCL injury as 841.1: Sprain ulnar collateral ligament.  There were a total of 336 discharges of UCL injuries.  Within the total discharges, separated by age groups: 18- to 44-year-olds; 165 people (49.17%). 45- to 64-year-olds; 91 (27.08%). 65- to 84-year-olds, 65 (19.35%) it shows that the ulnar collateral ligament injuries were more commonly found in men than women.  There were 213 men compared to 123 women with ulnar collateral ligament injury.  Most of these injuries were also paid through private insurance (170: 50.63%) and Medicare (70: 20.85%).  The average estimated cost for the surgery also known as Tommy John surgery is $21,563.\n\nReferences \n\nLigaments of the upper limb\nInjuries", "machine_text": " Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the elbow The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a ligament on the medial (inner) side of the elbow. The UCL is the main stabilizer of the elbow joint. The ulnar collateral ligament can be injured in several ways. The most common mechanism is a valgus force to the elbow. A valgus force is when the hand is forced outward (away from the body) and the elbow is forced inward (toward the body). This injury can occur from a direct blow to the elbow, a fall, or from throwing a punch. It can also occur from repetitive stress to the elbow, such as from pitching a baseball or from doing gymnastics. When the UCL is injured, there is pain on the medial side of the elbow, and the elbow may feel weak. There may also be swelling and bruising. Initial treatment of a UCL injury is rest, ice, elevation, and compression. This helps to reduce pain and swelling. Physical therapy may be recommended to improve range of motion and strength. If the injury is severe, surgery may be needed to reconstruct the UCL.

In 1892 Karrer's family returned to Switzerland where he was educated at Wildegg and at the grammar school in Lenzburg, Aarau, where he matriculated in 1908. He studied chemistry at the University of Zurich under Alfred Werner and after gaining his Ph.D. in 1911, he spent a further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute. He then took a post as chemist with Paul Ehrlich at the Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt-am-Main. In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute.\n\nResearch\nKarrer's early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned plant pigments, particularly the yellow carotenoids. He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into vitamin A. His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for beta-carotene, the chief precursor of vitamin A; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established. George Wald worked briefly in Karrer's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the retina. Later, Karrer confirmed the structure of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and extended his researches into the vitamin B2 and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the flavins led to identification of lactoflavin as part of the complex originally thought to be vitamin B2.\n\nKarrer published many papers, and received many honours and awards, including the Nobel Prize in 1937. His textbook Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie (Textbook of Organic Chemistry) was published in 1927, went through thirteen editions, and was published in seven languages.\n\nPersonal life\nKarrer was married to Helena Froelich in 1914 and had three sons, one of whom died in infancy. He died on 18 June 1971, at the age of 82 in Z\u00fcrich. His wife died in 1972.\n\nLegacy\nThe prestigious Paul Karrer Gold Medal and lecture was established in his honour in 1959 by a group of leading companies such as CIBA AG, J.R. Geigy, F.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Night Without End\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Night Without End is a thriller novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean, first published in 1959.  The author has been complimented for the excellent depiction of the unforgiving Arctic environment; among others, the Times Literary Supplement gave it strongly favorable notices when it came out.\n\nPlot summary\nA BOAC airplane crash-lands on the Greenland ice cap far from its usual route after flying in a seemingly erratic fashion. An International Geophysical Year scientific research team based near the crash site rescues the surviving passengers and takes them to their cabin. Most of the flight crew are dead with one of the pilots having been shot in the back. The station's only means of contact with the outside world, a radio set, is destroyed in a seemingly accidental manner.\n\nWith not enough food for everyone and no hope of rescue, the leader of the scientific research team, Dr Mason, decides that they must set out for the nearest settlement, some 300 kilometers away at the coast. Meanwhile, the pilot who was shot and in a coma is found to have been suffocated with a pillow in his sleep. An attempt is also made on Mason's life by getting him to be lost in the arctic night. The scientists' suspicion falls on the stewardess but she is soon cleared. Mason orders another scientist, Joss, to stay behind and try to repair the radio so that a field expedition can be contacted. The dead passenger is determined to be a military courier; soon after that the wreck goes up in flames.\n\nMason leaves with the group along with the other scientist, Jackstraw, while remaining in touch with their station by means of a short range radio. Meanwhile, the field expedition returns to the station and contacts Mason. They inform him that a massive military mobilization has located the crashed plane and that it carried something very important. The government, having refused to divulge anything, had tried to contact Mason's station. Finding the station to be non-responding, they have requested the expedition chief, Captain Hillcrest, to investigate.\n\nMason decides to go on with the journey since any attempt to return will induce the murderers to act. He keeps this new  development to himself and Jackstraw. Hillcrest sets out after the group but soon finds that the petrol he picked up at the station has been tampered with. Sugar has been added to the petrol disabling the engine and leading him to get bogged down. A solution is found when one of the passengers, a chemist, suggests that the petrol be mixed with water and the top layer of the resultant mixture be siphoned off. At almost the same time, the government relents and informs Mason through Hillcrest that the military courier carried a top secret missile guidance mechanism disguised as a tape recorder. Mason realizes that one of the passengers picked up such a device at the crash site. This precipitates the murderers into action and they take over the group.\n\nFinding that killing the entire group is not possible, the criminals initially take the survivors with them, but soon abandon all of them except for the stewardess, for whom Mason has developed a romantic attachment, and the father and manager of a passenger who is a boxer. In the process, one of the passengers left behind is killed. The group stumbles on in the arctic blizzard guided by sled dogs. Soon they come across an abandoned sled that contains rocket radiosondes, which they use to guide Hillcrest to them. A chase ensues across the arctic landscape to the shore where a trawler waits for the criminals. But the intervention of the Navy, on information from Hillcrest, frightens off the trawler. The criminals are surrounded and after a bitter hand-to-hand struggle, the secret device and surviving hostages are rescued.\n\nThe first killer is killed, however the second one is still on the go. Having to have locked himself and the stewardess in a very fast moving glacier, it is not as easy for him anymore. Dr. Mason manages to rescue the stewardess, but the killer is left to die.\n\nReception\nThe New York Times called it a \"bang up adventure yarn filled with realistic, well researched data.\" The Chicago Tribune called the book \"powerful\". Michael Frayn in The Guardian called it \"clumsily written, absurdly implausible, thoroughly chilling.\"\n\nProposed adaptation\nIn August 1959 film rights were bought by George Seaton and William Perlberg who had a deal with Paramount. They wanted to make the film with Debbie Reynolds with whom they had a long-term contract. They hired Eric Ambler to write a script. Lilli Palmer was announced as co star.\n\nIn 1961 Seaton said they wanted to film it after The Hook. William Holden was attached as star.  In December 1961 it was announced Richard Wilson would direct at Paramount. In 1963 Wilson said he still had a commitment to make the film, and had written the script with his wife Elizabeth Vance. However the film was never made.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Book review at AlistairMacLean.com\n\nNovels by Alistair MacLean\n1959 British novels\nNovels set in Greenland\nWilliam Collins, Sons books\nDoubleday (publisher) books", "machine_text": " Night Without End is a 1985 British horror film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Lee Montgomery, Ann Bell, David Collings, and Brian Glover.

The film is set in a German castle in the early 20th century. The castle's owner, Count Karl Von Drummond (David Collings), invites several guests to stay with him for a hunting party. The guests include Scientists Sir Basil Thistleton (Montgomery), Professor Helius (Glover), and Dr. Max Nett (Jurgens), along with Count's sister, Baroness Elsa (Ann Bell), and Elsa's husband, Baron Karl (Michael Hoger).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (; ZNDH), was the air force of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a puppet state established with the support of the Axis Powers on the territory of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during World War II. The ZNDH was founded under German authority in April 1941, following the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nAlthough it could not be considered a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe ZNDH maintained a flying training school equipped with gliders and trainers, originally at Rajlovac airfield near Sarajevo and then at Velika Gorica and Pleso airfields in Zagreb. Its parachute and paratroop school was located in Koprivnica.\n\nHistory\n\nEstablishment\nThe ZNDH came into being as early as 19 April 1941, just nine days after the proclamation of the NDH. Its commander was Colonel Vladimir Kren, a former captain of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (; VVKJ), who had defected to the Germans in Graz in his Potez 25 on 4 April 1941 and declared himself an Usta\u0161e supporter.\n \nThe first task of the new air force, the backbone of which was provided by 500 former VVKJ officers and 1,600 NCOs, was the acquisition or salvage of aircraft, weapons, machinery, equipment and fuel that had survived the fighting and had not been confiscated by the German or Italian forces.\n\nFollowing the brief April War, the Germans had captured over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered them to be of little use for the Luftwaffe, so it was decided to equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.\n\nKren also initiated the formation of an early warning system, anti-aircraft batteries (armed with German and Czech weapons) and various training and servicing departments, ammunition stores and workshop facilities. The fuel necessary for the operations of the ZNDH was supplied by the Germans from former Yugoslav stocks in Kraljevo, Serbia.\n\nAs early as May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they got some of the remaining largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, as well as a huge variety of spare parts.\n\nDuring the middle part of 1941, some of the ZNDH's man-power capacity (one fighter squadron and one medium bomber squadron) was sent to the Eastern Front as part of the Luftwaffe, the Croatian Air Force Legion (; HZL; ). Most of the Croatian Air Force Legion's personnel were back on NDH territory by late 1942 (bomber squadron)/early 1944 (fighter squadron) to help counter the growing Allied air threat.\n\nThe personnel of the ZNDH took over and re-activated the airfields at Zagreb, Sarajevo, Mostar, Banja Luka and Zemun, where the Ikarus and Zmaj aircraft plants were located. By June 1941, the Germans had begun to pass on to the ZNDH various captured VVKJ aircraft, including eight Bristol Blenheim I and five Potez 25 bombers. These and most of the 211 ex-VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and/or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun.\n\nThe first missions: 1941\n\nIn late 1941 the ZNDH had 95 aircraft distributed in four groups and eight squadrons. Fighting the Yugoslav Partisans from the air had begun already in late June 1941, when Breguet 19 and Potez 25  bombers had proved most suitable. The Breguets could carry a bomb load of up to  using 24  bombs, whilst the Potez 25s could carry about half that amount. Both types were also armed with three  machine guns. Altogether the ZNDH eventually came to possess 50 Breguet 19s and 45 Potez 25s. The operational use of these light bombers was not limited to fighting the Partisans; the aircraft were also used to supply isolated or surrounded army strong points.\n\nThe emblem of the ZNDH was to be the red and white chequerboard insignia, (), derived from the Croat coat of arms, dating back to the 10th century, carried on the fin. In January 1945 this was replaced by the black and white trefoil cross of King Zvonimir.\n\nAs well as the Breguet and Potez aircraft, which were the most numerous types in the ZNDH inventory, Zmaj Fizir FP-2 light biplane trainers were also converted to carry six  bombs. These aircraft were used to bomb and strafe Partisan troops and positions in northern Bosnia but they also faced anti-aircraft fire. The first missions cost the ZNDH a Breguet and a Potez aircraft, both of which crash landed after being hit by Partisan ground fire. The ZNDH crews had little chance of survival after being hit, as flying suits, helmets and parachutes were not available at the time - hence their desperate crash-landings.\n\nSimilar actions continued throughout 1941. The ZNDH flew many missions in support of Army troops in limited scale operations against the Partisans mostly over eastern and western Bosnia, as well as over other parts of the NDH. By September, the ZNDH introduced larger aircraft for bombing Partisan forces and territory. Two bombers, an Avia Fokker F.IX derived F.39 and a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 were available for operations and had the added advantage of being able to carry  bombs. They were extensively used for bombing villages and road communications. However it was soon established that the vintage biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft were ideally suited for missions against Partisan troop concentrations. Although they were outdated and certainly their use would be out of the question on any other front, their performance and armament made them very dangerous for an ill-armed enemy. The Partisans were scattered in villages, forests and mountains and their positions could only be detected by a slow moving aircraft. Visual reconnaissance missions using hand-held cameras were also flown. Aerial reconnaissance supplied the army with vital data about Partisan movements and positions and about the situation in Partisan territory in general. This was all the more important because the army desperately lacked radio equipment of all kinds. Light aircraft were frequently used for liaison duties, particularly connecting the surrounding army garrisons and higher command. Often the Army requested one or two aircraft to be temporarily attached to particular army units to closely co-operate with ground troops.\n\nThe ZNDH's fighter force was poorly equipped in every respect, consisting of 12 ex-VVKJ machines including four Ikarus IK-2s, seven ancient Avia BH-33 Es and one Hawker Fury II. Fortunately for this ill-equipped force, there was no aerial opposition and some more modern fighter aircraft were received from 1942 onwards.\n\nColder October and November weather limited aerial activities over the NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their appearance on the Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Vi\u0161egrad.\n\nExpansion: 1942\n\nIn 1942, fighting with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments were aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.\n\nThe first half of 1942 was marked by several deliveries of new or refurbished aircraft from Germany and Italy, aside from those received from Ikarus in Zemun. First of all the ZNDH received 10 brand new Caproni Ca.311 M medium bombers from Italy. These aircraft had been ordered and paid for by the Yugoslav Government for service in the VVKJ, but the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia prevented delivery. The ZNDH also purchased 20 AVIA FL.3 basic trainers, nine Fiat G.50bis fighters and one Fiat G.50B two-seat fighter trainer. The Fiat aircraft were to provide the ZNDH's fighter pilots with some operational training on more modern aircraft.\n\nOther batches of overhauled ex-VVKJ aircraft also arrived from the Ikarus aircraft plant in Zemun, including 11 Dornier Do 17K, three Bristol Blenheim Mk I and one Caproni Ca.310 bombers, 15 Rogo\u017earski PVT and 11 Rogo\u017earski R-100 attack aircraft, which had been fitted with bomb racks to carry  bombs, plus a few Breguet 19s, Potez 25s, Zmaj Fizir FNs and Zmaj Fizir FP-2s. From Prague in Czechoslovakia (under German occupation), the ZNDH received seven Avia Fokker F.7 transports, one Avia Fokker F.9 and one Avia Fokker F.18. Of these, the F.7s and F.18 were pre-war Czech airliners. As the ZNDH suffered from a total lack of transport aircraft, these were immediately pressed into service, after only minor adjustments. Some were even used to provide scheduled air-line services.\n\nThe nine Fiat G.50bis fighters took off from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before crossing the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft had to wait until 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 gull wing fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogo\u017earski R-100 parasol wing fighter-trainers.\n\nThanks to this extended aircraft park the ZNDH could now form new units: in January the 1st Group, comprising the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 19th Squadrons was formed at Zagreb, and then the 2nd Group with the 4th, 5th and 6th squadrons and the 3rd Group with the 7th, 8th and 9th Squadrons at Sarajevo's Rajlovac airfield, whilst the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka's Zaluzani airfield in June 1942 to cover operations in central Croatia and western Bosnia.\n\nThese reinforcements came just in time to participate in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. Initially, the Regia Aeronautica also participated in this campaign, but after an incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica, the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground. At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavian territory. In support of the ground forces, the ZNDH flew 121 combat missions in January, 100 missions in February and 350 in March. Although the Axis ground forces generally succeeded in their operations in January and February, in March they were forced to release the pressure as other Partisan units attacked several solitary NDH garrisons, threatening to destroy them.\n\nAside from constant bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft were also used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As a result of the determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.\n\nAs the weather improved towards the summer, flying activity intensified. Some 325 missions were flown during April, with a further 350 sorties during May, including  direct combat support, reconnaissance and supply missions, as well as leaflet dropping. Most of the missions were performed by the 2nd and 3rd Group's squadrons based at Sarajevo, which was the strongest operational base at that time. The Zagreb air base was principally employed in attacking Partisan positions in western Slavonia and Bosnia.\n\nThe 10 new Caproni Ca.311Ms were tried out during the successive attacks on Partisan territory. They were equally divided between 3rd Squadron (Zagreb) and 7th Squadron (Rajlovac). During September and October Blenheims from 8th Squadron and the Dornier Do 17Ks from 3rd and 9th Squadrons were extensively used to attack Partisan positions in Biha\u0107, Bugojno, Livno and Duvno and Bosnia. Owing to the availability of increased numbers of aircraft, the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka comprising the 13th, 16th, 17th and 18th Squadrons. Not only did this medium bomber force fly reconnaissance and bombing missions against Partisan forces, but also flew deep into  territory under Partisan control and attacked railway stations, road traffic, agricultural depots and food stocks. The Partisan forces were aware of the threat to their operations that the ZNDH provided and were constantly trying to improve their anti-aircraft defence, which relied mainly on machineguns.\n\nDecember 1942 also saw the return of the HZL bomber squadron to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory right up to the end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide operational training. It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.\n\nDuring the course of 1942, the ZNDH flew some 4,800 sorties, of which 30% were combat missions, with 35 aircraft being lost. Of these losses, 19 were to Partisan ground fire, 12 to accidents and four deserted. By the end of the year the ZNDH aircraft park consisted of 191 aircraft, formed into 14 squadrons.\n\n1942 had seen the first desertions of aircraft from the ZNDH, the first on 23 May when a Breguet and a Potez had defected to the Partisan forces. The army conducted an intensive search for the aircraft and in response the Partisans produced two decoy scale-model aircraft, made of wood and canvas, which were duly destroyed by ZNDH bombers. Both \"destroyed\" aircraft were able to perform a number of attacks on army units (armed with hand-made pipe bombs) before either being shot down (the Breguet on 4 June) or destroyed on the ground (the Potez on 6 July). The two other defections occurred in July and October, with a Blenheim bomber in each case flying to Turkey.\n\nZNDH paratroops\nIn January 1942, the ZNDH formed a parachute unit, known as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Company (, 1 PLS). It had a strength of 120 men and was based in the northern town of Koprivnica, near the border with Hungary. An Avia Fokker F.7 tri-motor transport aircraft was assigned to the unit on a permanent basis, with other transports assigned as required. The paratroops were equipped with rifles, sub-machine guns, light machine guns and light mortars. After a period of training, 1 PLS made a demonstration mass tactical jump on 6 July 1943 at Borongaj airfield, Zagreb. Forty five paratroopers made a successful jump from three Avia Fokker transports.\n\nOn 6 November 1943, three brigades of the Partisans, supported by artillery and heavy machine-guns mounted an attack on the town of Koprivnica, which they took on 9 November. The paratroops of 1 PLS held out at their base for three days before withdrawing into Hungary and continuing the battle with other NDH and German defending forces until 29 November. They received direct air support from ZNDH Dornier Do 17Ks, as well as supplies from light aircraft, but were unable to prevent the loss of their base, together with 20 men, all of their parachute equipment and their transport aircraft. The ZNDH also lost a Dornier Do 17K bomber and a B\u00fccker B\u00fc 131 biplane shot down during this period.\n\nThe unit was re-deployed in 1944 to Borongaj airfield in Zagreb and in June 1944 grew in strength with the addition of three further companies and was re-designated as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Battalion (, 1 PLB). They were responsible for the ground defence of this important air base and also performed ceremonial guard duties in Zagreb itself. By late January 1945 the unit was equipped with white winter jackets for camouflage and attached to the NDH Motorized Brigade, seeing its first action on this new sector, south of Zagreb. 1 PLB remained in constant action against the advancing Partisans until the last unit surrendered in Austria on 14 May 1945, one week after the official end of World War II.\n\n1943\n\nAt the beginning of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected and that was the primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding the fact that there was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by the beginning of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in the beginning of 1943.\n\nThis was because the situation began to change in favour of the Allies. They had landed in North Africa while the Soviets were undertaking their great winter offensive, endangering, and eventually defeating, the German 6th Army around Stalingrad.\n\nThe Partisan movement in Yugoslavia, aside from some smaller territories, established a large liberated territory extending west of the rivers Neretva and Bosna, in the direction of the cities of Zagreb and Rijeka. The Partisan force had grown stronger \u2013 it had more than 60,000 armed fighters in this so-called \"Tito's State\" who were both well trained and supported by artillery. On 20 January 1943, the German HQ in Yugoslavia launched an offensive codenamed Case White (), intending to regain the lost territory. The attack was supported by aircraft from the Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica and the ZNDH. Aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd Groups from Sarajevo and the 6th Group from Banja Luka were involved in bombing raids as well as leaflet dropping missions.\n\nThe Banja Luka air base was reinforced by a newly formed 5th Group after the end of Case White. The ZNDH now consisted of three air bases with six Groups and 14 squadrons. During 1943 new aircraft continued to arrive, with 30 overhauled Dornier Do 17E bombers delivered from Germany and divided between the 3rd Squadron (Zagreb), and the 13th and 15th Squadrons (Banja Luka). From Italy came 34 long promised ex-VVKJ B\u00fccker B\u00fc 131 Jungmans and 25 Saiman 200 light biplane trainers and liaison aircraft, which were dispatched to all three air bases. They were also used to deliver mail and fresh meat to isolated/surrounded towns and garrisons.\n\nAlthough the ZNDH had a brief role in the subsequent anti-Partisan offensive, Case Black () in mid-1943, its main involvement was on the front in the central NDH. As always, the Partisan resistance displayed frustrating survivability and effectiveness and new events started to influence the fighting in Yugoslavia. The Partisan forces were well aware of the constant threat of air attack posed by the ZNDH's medium bomber force and on 10 August 1943 undertook a devastating night attack by a brigade on Sarajevo's Rajlovac airfield. The three and a half hour assault on the airfield left 10 ZNDH bombers, plus another five Luftwaffe bombers and transports, destroyed, with another 17 aircraft damaged. Although some aircrews returned fire from the machine-gun turrets of their aircraft, Partisan losses were less than 20. Afterwards ZNDH Command complained that the German ordered dispersal of aircraft around the airfield's perimeter, in case of air attack, made the aircraft especially vulnerable to just this type of ground attack.\n\nBy mid-1943, following the capture of southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger and was trying to persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Bene\u0161-Mr\u00e1z Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.\n\nMid-September 1943 saw the dismissal of Kren from command of the ZNDH. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Adalbert Rogulja, who initiated a major reorganisation.\n\nFollowing the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft were found at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 machines were incorporated into the ZNDH. This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters, as well as six Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters. Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 bombers were also added into the ZNDH. The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20-25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans.\n\nThe capitulation of Italy also brought with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew bailing out. One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to the vicinity of the Dalmatian coast.\n\nAttacks on Partisan forces continued, and on 3 October seven Dornier Do 17Zs caught 2. bataljon of Brigada Bra\u0107a Radi\u0107 (2nd battalion of the Radi\u0107 Brothers Brigade) on the move at \u0160emovec, on the Vara\u017edin-Ludbreg road. In over one hour's concentrated aerial bombardment, the battalion sustained some 60 casualties, including 42 dead.\n\nAlthough the ZNDH was now able to mount a credible threat against the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving from the other side of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters \u2013 aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.\n\nBy the end of 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft, having lost 61 shot down, destroyed on the ground, in accidents and five desertions.\n\n1944\n\nWith the capitulation of Italy, the ZNDH lost an important source of new aircraft and the tide turned significantly when Allied air raids on targets in the Balkans became a reality. The Luftwaffe fighter squadrons stationed in Ljubljana, Zagreb, southern Austria and northern Italy fought heavy battles to stop the American USAAF heavy bomber armada. The ZNDH was also included in the defence with the newly formed 11th Fighter Group () consisting of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Fighter Squadrons () equipped with Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 aircraft.\n\n1944 also saw the return of the HZL fighter squadron to the NDH from service on the Eastern Front. It was redesignated Kroat. JGr 1 and its operational fighter squadron was redesignated 2./(Kroat.)JGr. Soon after arrival 2./(Kroat.)JGr sent its ZNDH pilots to collect 12 brand new Macchi C.202 fighters direct from the plant near Milan in Italy. The Italian designed and built Macchi C.202 fighter was the first up-to-date fighter available to the ZNDH. These aircraft retained their Luftwaffe markings whilst in service with the unit. A second training/operational conversion squadron was also formed, designated 3./(Kroat.)JGr and equipped with Fiat G.50, Macchi C.200 and Fiat CR.42 fighters. After a period of operational conversion, the squadron commenced operations against the frequent incursions over the NDH by USAAF and RAF aircraft. During a period of intensive activity over the summer of 1944, the squadron claimed some 20 Allied aircraft shot down, while at the same time receiving six further Macchi C.202s, as well as four brand new Macchi C.205s.\n\nThe ZNDH's long obsolete Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 fighter aircraft also attempted to intercept the USAAF bomber formations, often stressing their old engines beyond the limit. They were no match for the escorting Mustang and Thunderbolt USAAF fighters and suffered heavy losses, both in the air and on the ground.\n\nBy the end of 1944 the HZL squadron had handed in its remaining worn-out Macchis for brand new German Messerschmitt Bf 109G & K fighters. A total of 21 Bf 109s had been delivered to the ZNDH by year's end.\n\nAllied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation R\u00f6sselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during R\u00f6sselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.\n\nIn June, the ZNDH finally received from Germany the long-promised airdrop containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons all over the NDH. They were immediately put to good use and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.\n\nToward the end of June, the ZNDH received the first of 22 B\u00fccker B\u00fc 181 Bestmann aircraft. The 19th and 20th Transport Squadrons received five each, with the remainder issued to the 1st Pilot School. Besides liaison duties, they were used to transport fresh meat from Bosnia to Zagreb, where there was a food shortage.\n\nFifteen Ju 87D dive bombers and a few Ju 87R-2 extended range dive bombers are known to have been supplied to the HZL, and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the late summer of 1944.\n\nIn the second half of 1944, the situation on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.\n\nThe Germans also continued to supply second-line aircraft to the ZNDH, including between nine and 12 exotic Fieseler Fi 167 biplane torpedo bombers. These had been originally designed and intended for use aboard the German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, which was never completed. After that they were sold to the NDH, where their short-field and load-carrying abilities made them ideal not only for attack missions, but also for transporting ammunition and other supplies to besieged army garrisons. Many of these missions were flown between their arrival in September 1944 and the end of the War (under the right conditions, the aircraft could descend almost vertically). During one such mission, near Sisak on 10 October 1944, an Fi 167 of the ZNDH  was attacked by five P-51 Mustang Mk IIIs of 213 Squadron RAF. The crew of the Fieseler (piloted by an ex-HZL eight-kill Flying ace), exploiting the aircraft's extreme maneuverability to the fullest, had the distinction of shooting down one of the Mustangs before itself being shot down; possibly one of the last biplane \"kills\" of the war.\n\n1945\n\nThe year preceding 1945 had been catastrophic for the ZNDH. Aircraft losses amounted to 234, primarily on the ground, and it began 1945 with 196 machines, including 17 Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs, 12 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, seven Fiat G.50s and two Fiat CR.42 fighters and some 30 multi-engined bombers, although shortages of fuel had begun to hamper operations.\n\nFurther deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses, with 39 arriving by the end of March. These included, in addition to regular Messerschmitt Bf 109G deliveries, the final dozen Dornier Do 17 medium bombers, which arrived in January. In March, despite the loss of 15 Bf 109G&Ks, ten Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, three Fiat CR.42 and two Fiat G.50, the ZNDH's fighter force included 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109G&Ks, three Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, six Fiat G.50 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110G fighters. With the Bf 109G the ZNDH were finally able to face the USAAF and RAF on equal terms, with two squadrons equipped with the type from late 1944. In April, the ZNDH still possessed 176 aircraft.\n\nThe ZNDH's modest transport force was also utilised in assisting with the evacuation of Sarajevo between the 1st and 5th of April, with Dornier Do 17, Savoia Marchetti SM 79 and SM 82, Caproni CA 311 and 313, as well as Junkers W34 aircraft taking part.  \n\nThe ZNDH's Dornier Do 17 medium bombers were still hitting back when and where they could. On 31 December 1944, a Dornier Do 17E destroyed an RAF 148 Squadron Handley Page Halifax bomber on the ground at the Partisan airfield in Grabovnica, near \u010cazma. On 10 February 1945, after a bridge-busting sortie on the Drava, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z bombed the Partisans' 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) near Daruvar, inflicting two dozen casualties. Late in the afternoon of 30 March, four Dornier Do 17Z bombers, escorted by four Bf 109G fighters attacked the Partisans near Gospi\u0107. On 15 April 1945, a force made up of a Dornier Do 17Z, escorted by two Bf 109Gs destroyed two Partisan aircraft at their airfield in Sanski Most. \n\nDespite these raids, the war's outcome had become apparent. Defections of ZNDH personnel and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery took place on 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs, one of which was confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogo\u017earski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built parasol wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and shot on the spot.\n\nThat evening, with the Partisans advancing upon Zagreb, the commanding officer of the ZNDH fighter group gathered his men at Zagreb's Lucko airfield and released them from their oath of loyalty and announced that each was free to go. Some flew their aircraft and crews, including several Dornier Do 17s and a CANT Z.1007 to Italy and surrendered to the Allied forces there. Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans, including several light aircraft and some Bf 109s, whilst others, also including Bf 109s, as well as at least one Dornier Do 17Z, a Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2, a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav-designed and built Zmaj Fizir FP-2, sought sanctuary in Klagenfurt, Austria.\n\nThe ZNDH's four-year campaign, during which it had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft, thus ended with the capture of the airbases around Zagreb on 8 May 1945. Its colourful collection of often vintage aircraft, scattered on deserted airfields, received new markings, a red star, and formed the basis of the new Yugoslav Air Force.\n\nRanks\n\nCommanders\n Vladimir Kren (April 1941\u201313 September 1943)\n  (23 September 1943 \u2013 1 June 1944)\n Vladimir Kren (June 1944\u2013May 1945)\n\nService types\n\nSource:\n\nJournal\nThe ZNDH published a weekly journal called Hrvatska Krila (Croatian Wings).\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Holocaust in Yugoslavia\nCollaboration during World War II\nCollaboration with the Axis Powers\nAviation in Croatia\nAir Force of the Independent State of Croatia\nDisbanded air forces\nYugoslavia invasion\nYugoslavia in World War II", "machine_text": " Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (Croatian: Hrvatsko Ratno Zrakoplovstvo) was the aviation branch of the Croatian Armed Forces during the existence of the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany which was established on 10 April 1941, and which ceased to exist on 8 May 1945. The Air Force was established by the Hrvatsko Narodnooslobodila\u010dka Vojska (Croatian National Defense War Army), which was formed on the basis of the Croatian Air Force which, in turn, was formed on the basis of the Zrakoplovstvo Nejedr\u017eava Hrvatska (Croatian Private Air Force), which had been formed in the spring of 1940. The Air Force was organized into three groups, which in turn were divided into squadrons and flights. It consisted of around 20,000 members, of whom around 5,000 were officers and NCOs, and 15,000 were airmen. The Air Force used the Zrakoplovni Vojnik (Air Force Pilot) military service branch. At the end of its existence, the Air Force consisted of: * 37 Fighters * 4 Bombers * 13 Reconnaissance and liaison aircraft * 4 Seaplanes * 2 Flying boats * 3 Air Observation Post (AOP) aircraft * 6 gliders * 2 Helicopter * 3 Air-to-Surface Vectored (ASV) rocket-launchers The Air Force's commander was General Vladimir Kren, while General Kre\u0161imir Kruni\u0107 was the Chief of Staff. The Air Force's main base was at Zagreb, with additional airfields at Dubrovnik, Mostar, \u0160ep\u0107e (in Banja Luka), and Zemun. The Air Force also had a training facility at Ilok, and an air defense unit at Zagreb. The Air Force's aircraft were Italian, German, and locally produced. The Air Force was involved in several battles during the Croatian War of Independence, including the Battle of Su\u0161ak, the Battle of Vara\u017edin, the Battle of Karlovac, the Battle of Bosansko Grahovo, the Battle of Klokotini, the Battle of the Republic of Srpska, and the Battle of Biha\u0107. On 8 May 1945, the Independent State of Croatia ceased to exist, and the Air Force was officially disbanded.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14176354}

The film explores the history of the income tax in the United States and the causes of its many complexities.\n\nSynopsis\nAn Inconvenient Tax examines the Federal Income Tax and how Congress uses the complex tax code to achieve political goals that are unrelated to raising revenue. The result of 95 years of additions, subtractions, deductions, and exclusions, the 62,000 page tax code is so complex that many are voicing their desire to greatly simplify it or to even completely remove it. Currently, tax revenue cannot even pay for government spending. The film follows the progression of taxation through wars, economic booms, and significant presidencies in U.S. history. An Inconvenient Tax includes commentary from some of the nation's best-known economic experts, commentators, and political voices. Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, Steve Forbes, Joseph Thorndike, Mike Huckabee, Charles Rossotti, David Walker, Neal Boortz, Herman Cain, Michael Graetz, Daniel Shaviro, Leonard Burman, and others discuss perceived problems in the American tax code, and also suggest possible changes. The possible solutions discussed include the FairTax, flat tax, and value added tax (VAT).\n\nAn Inconvenient Tax was officially released on Tax Day \u2013 April 15, 2010.\n\nPress\nOn April 11, 2011, Life Is My Movie Entertainment announced that An Inconvenient Tax had been acquired by Gravitas Ventures and would be distributed through cable, satellite, telco, and online Video-on-Demand (VOD) in June of that year.\nOn July 4, 2011, LIMM announced that the film would be available for international release through Octapixx Worldwide.\n\nReception\nThe film received positive reviews from mainly right-leaning critics. The Swash, a libertarian news site, called the film a \u201cmust see, especially to those who are actually ignorant of what it really is, how it came to be and how it should be.\u201d Another conservative critic said that it was a great way to \u201clearn quite a bit in a fairly enjoyable fashion.\u201d Director Christopher P.

Such a tax may be intended to increase the cost of a product or service, or to discourage the use of a product or service that is considered unhealthy or environmentally harmful. The term was coined by the economist Arthur Laffer, who argued that such taxes are often ineffective because they are ignored by producers and consumers. In the context of excise taxes, the term \"inconvenient\" generally refers to the difficulty of determining the amount of tax that is owed, or the difficulty of collecting the tax from producers or consumers. For example, a tax on the sale of gasoline may be considered an inconvenient tax, because the tax is applied at the pump, and the amount of tax that is owed may not be clear to consumers. Similarly, a tax on the sale of cigarettes may be considered an inconvenient tax, because the tax is applied at the point of sale, and the amount of tax that is owed may not be clear to consumers. Laffer argued that such taxes are often ineffective because they are ignored by producers and consumers. He argued that producers may choose to absorb the cost of the tax, rather than pass it on to consumers, if the tax is not sufficiently high to make it worthwhile to collect. He also argued that consumers may choose to avoid the tax by engaging in tax evasion or tax avoidance.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21065038}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Karl Stromberg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd J\u00fcrgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl who is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used.\n\nBiography\n\nThe webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is \"Sigmund\".\n\nScheme\nAlthough Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the \"surface world\". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are \"buried at sea\".)\n\nThis scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman.\n\nPrevention\nStromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.\n\nBond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.\n\nHenchmen\n Jaws - survived\n Naomi - blown up by Bond\n Sandor - thrown off the edge of a building by Bond\n Liparus Captain - fatally wounded by an explosion\n Professor Markowitz - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Dr. Bechmann - blown up in helicopter explosion\n Kate Chapman - eaten by shark\n Captain, Stromberg 1 (formerly Soviet submarine Potemkin) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 2\n Captain, Stromberg 2 (formerly British submarine HMS Ranger) - nuked, along with his entire crew, by Stromberg 1\n Motorbike Henchman - blinded and sent off a cliff\n Three Men in Jaws' car - all killed in car crash\n A small army of red soldiers\n\nSee also\nList of James Bond villains\nJames Bond in film\n\nReferences\n\nBond villains\nFictional German people\nFictional Swedish people\nJames Bond characters\nFictional businesspeople\nFictional dictators\nFictional warlords\nThe Spy Who Loved Me (film)\nFilm characters introduced in 1977\nFictional terrorists\nMale literary villains\nMale film villains\nAction film villains\nFilm supervillains", "machine_text": " Karl Stromberg is a fictional character of the German author Arthur Moeller van den Bruck.

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.\n\nPlot summary\nThe Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring.  The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.\n\nAunt Gertrude's carton\nEnigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you\u2019ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.\u201d Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy\u2019s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude\u2019s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.\n\nGoing fishing\nLater, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.\n\nMysteries in Bayport\nMeanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.\n\nAunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme.\n\nTaking a cruise\nThe boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.\n\nMr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.\n\nThe boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship\u2019s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture'''s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship\u2019s crew and captured.\n\nCaptivity\nHeld captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship\u2019s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line \u201csailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster\u2026\u201d. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail  (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly \u201csmuggler\u201d Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain''.\n\nReferences \n\nThe Hardy Boys books\n1947 American novels\n1947 children's books\n1970 American novels\n1970 children's books\nNovels set on ships\nGrosset & Dunlap books", "machine_text": " The Phantom Freighter is a legendary ghost ship in Coast Guard folklore that has been spotted off the coast of Massachusetts.

He went to the English College in Rome, at the age of twenty, where he was ordained as a priest, returning to England as a missionary in 1602.

He was arrested in 1608, and then again in 1612. In November 1612, seven priests escaped from prison. It was alleged that, whilst in prison, Almond had said that \"whosoever had killed a king, and were afterward penitent ... and did confesse the same to a priest, might have absolution\".\n\nJohn Almond was hanged, drawn, and quartered on 5 December 1612 at Tyburn, London, England.

After his ordination, Almond became involved with the underground Catholic movement in England. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London on 20 April 1569, and examined by the Earl of Sussex and other lords on 22 April. He was accused of having said that \"the Pope was the true pope, and that religion and the Catholic faith was to be had nowhere but in the Catholic Church\". On 25 April, he was brought to trial at the King's Bench Court, where he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. On 27 April, he was taken to the yard of the Tower, where he was executed.

It is known for the colourful LED lighting that has adorned its facade since 2008. The site was previously an indoor shopping arcade.\n\nOpened in 1960, the building is located at 137 Yonge Street at Temperance Street and extends eastward to 74 Victoria Street at Lombard Street. The upper floors are commercial office space. The first floor originally had an arcade-style retail concourse but this was closed in 2008 and the main floor was redeveloped as a GoodLife Fitness centre and office space.\n\nThe outer facade is steel and glass in the internationalist style.\n\nOriginal Arcade building\nThe 1960 building replaced the 1884 Yonge Street Arcade, an indoor shopping mall and commercial building that was demolished in 1954. The original 1884 building, designed by architect Charles A. Walton, is considered to be Canada's first indoor shopping mall, or arcade. The four-storey indoor mall linked Yonge Street and Temperance Streets to Victoria and Lombard Streets one block east. The arcade consisted of 52 retail stores and was intended to compete with the large nearby department stores. Businesses located at the arcade included the British American Business College on the top two floors, a dentist and a cattle dealer. The facility had two hydraulic elevators at either end of the arcade. The exterior was Ohio cut stone.\n\nThe arcade was a popular shopping destination for several decades. For a long time prominent signs proclaimed \"Nothing over $18\", and later, \"Nothing over $25\". By the 1950s, the building showed its age and the small shops and offices were considered outdated. Two fires damaged the structure in 1953. In January 1954, businesses were given one-month notices to vacate and the building was demolished later that year. The location was previously the site of the Bay Horse Hotel.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nBuildings and structures in Toronto\nBuildings and structures demolished in 1954\nBurned buildings and structures in Canada\nOffice buildings completed in 1960", "machine_text": " The Arcade Building is an historic commercial building located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 29\u201339 Queen Street West, on the south side of Queen Street, just east of Spadina Avenue. The building was designed by John M. Lyle in the Victorian Gothic style, and was built in 1892. The four-storey building is built of red brick with stone trim. The main facade is dominated by a three-storey arcade of Gothic arches, with the centre arch taller than the others. The arches are supported by clusters of colonettes. The building's original main entrance was through the central arch, but this has been closed up and a new entrance cut through the east wall of the building. The building's other main architectural features include the dormer windows on the fourth floor, and the two-storey polygonal bay window on the Spadina Avenue side of the building. The building was originally built for the Toronto Athletic Club, which had been founded in 1888 by a group of businessmen who wanted a club with a swimming pool and other sports facilities. In 1889, the club acquired the property at 29 Queen Street West, and commissioned the building from architect John M. Lyle, who had also designed the club's previous premises at 23 Mutual Street. The new building was completed in 1892, and the club moved into the building that year. The Toronto Athletic Club was a private club, with membership restricted to men. The club was one of several private social clubs in Toronto at the time, and was one of the city's most exclusive clubs. The club's facilities included a swimming pool, a billiards room, a reading room, a bar, and a restaurant. The club also had a number of sports teams, including a baseball team, a hockey team, and a tug-of-war team. In the early 20th century, the building was purchased by the Bank of Toronto, which used it as a bank branch until the early 1970s. The building was then sold to a developer, who converted it into an office building. The building is currently used as offices and retail space.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3166601}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Real-time text\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Real-time text (RTT) is text transmitted instantly as it is typed or created. Recipients can immediately read the message while it is being written, without waiting.\n\nReal-time text is used for conversational text, in collaboration, and in live captioning. Technologies include TDD/TTY devices for the deaf, live captioning for TV, Text over IP (ToIP), some types of instant messaging, captioning for telephony/video teleconferencing, telecommunications relay services including ip-relay, transcription services including Remote CART, TypeWell, collaborative text editing, streaming text applications, next-generation 9-1-1/1-1-2 emergency service. Obsolete TDD/TTY devices are being replaced by more modern real-time text technologies, including Text over IP, ip-relay, and instant messaging.\n\nDuring 2012, the Real-Time Text Taskforce (R3TF) designed a standard international symbol to represent real-time text, as well as the alternate name Fast Text to improve public education of the technology.\n\nUse over instant messaging \n\nWhile standard instant messaging is not real-time text (the message is only sent at the end of a thought, not while it is being composed), a real-time text option is found in some instant messaging software, including AOL Instant Messenger's \"Real-Time IM\" feature. Real-time text is also possible over any XMPP compatible chat networks, including those used by Apple iChat, Cisco WebEx, and Google Talk, by using appropriate software that has a real-time text feature. When present in IM programs, the real-time text feature can be turned on/off, just like other chat features such as audio. Real-time text programs date at least to the 1970s, with the talk program on the DEC PDP-11, which remains in use on Unix systems.\n\nCertain real-time text applications have a feature that allows the real-time text to be \"turned off\", for temporary purposes. This allows the sender to pre-compose the message as a standard IM or text message before transmitting.\n\nUse by the deaf \nReal-time text is frequently used by the deaf, including IP-Relay services, TDD/TTY devices, and Text over IP. Real-time text allows the other person to read immediately, without waiting for the sender to finish composing his or her sentence/message. This allows conversational use of text, much like a hearing person can listen to someone speaking in real-time.\n\nCaptioned telephony \nCaptioned telephony is the streaming of real-time text captions in parallel with speech on a phone call.  This is used by people who are hard of hearing to allow them to have the full benefit of listening as best they can, hearing all the intonation etc. in speech, yet have the captions for those words they cannot hear clearly enough.  In the United States, captioned telephony is one of the free relay services that is available to anyone who is hard-of-hearing. Originally developed for use on the analog phone systems (where it requires a special phone) it is now available over IP using standard devices.\n\nUse in collaboration \nCollaborative real-time editing is the utilization of real-time text for shared editing, rather than for conversation. Split screen chat, where conversational text appears continuously, is also considered real-time text. Some examples that provide this as a service are Apache Wave and its fork SwellRT, Etherpad, the editor Gobby, and most notably Google Docs.\n\nCaptioning, transcriptions and other uses \nReal-time text is used in closed captioning and when captions are being streamed live continuously during live events. Transcription services including Communication Access Real-Time Translation and TypeWell frequently use real-time text, where text is streamed live to a remote display. This is used in court reporting, and is also used by deaf attendees at a conference. Also, real-time text provides an enhancement to text messaging on mobile phones, via real-time texting apps.\n\nReal-time text protocols \nReal-time text protocols include Text over IP (ToIP) designed around ITU-T T.140, IETF RFC 4103, RFC 5194, and XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0301.\n\nTotal conversation \nAccording to ITU-T Multimedia Recommendation F.703, total conversation defines the simultaneous use of audio, video and real-time text. An instant messaging program that can enable all three features simultaneously would be compliant. Real time text is an important part of it.\n\nHistory \nReal-time text is also historically found in the old UNIX talk, BBS software such as Celerity BBS, and older versions of ICQ messaging software.\n\nSee also \n Collaborative real-time editor\n Text over IP\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n realtimetext.org - Real Time Text Taskforce (R3TF)\n realjabber.org - Animation of what real-time text looks like / Information on XEP-0301\n Total Conversation by IV\u00e8S\n Total Conversation by Omintor\n Total Conversation in the cloud\n\nIMS services\nText", "machine_text": " Real-time text Real-time text is text that is input or output immediately after its creation, as opposed to text that is stored and then displayed. Real-time text is a key feature of live streaming and live transcription, in which a person types what another person says. Real-time text may be created with a real-time text editor. One of the first uses of this technology was the Telestrator, which was invented by Martin Cooke in 1961. The Telestrator was a device that allowed one to draw on a television screen in real-time. It was first used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to annotate a television broadcast of the Canadian federal election in 1962. The technology was also used in the United States to annotate the America's Cup yacht races in 1967. Real-time text is used in instant messaging, online chat, and teletype. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was also used in the now-obsolete field of real-time document preparation, which was an alternative to the more familiar batch processing model of document preparation.

When he gives his list of demands, one of them is for Jax to come to Hale's office. Tara sees Salazar pull out a knife, and he tells her he plans to kill her while Jax watches and then kill Jax. As Jax enters the office, Salazar is about to kill Tara, but Jacob Hale stabs him instead. Jax wrestles the gun from Salazar, gives it to Tara, and tells her to kill anyone who is not a cop. When the whole ordeal is over with Jax and Tara go to the doctor for an ultrasound to make sure the baby was not harmed. The baby is healthy and Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax and Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and happily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has become more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in the trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she wears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong. When Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually a trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught and fearing that the club will kill him in prison. With the help of Unser, Chibs Telford kills Jimmy O'Phelan in retribution for stealing his wife and daughter many years ago, before Opie forces a terrified Stahl in the front seat of the cop car. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, \"This is what she felt.\" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her, to avenge the death of his wife Donna. After this, Chibs rigs the scene to look as if the real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy. Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress Maureen Ashby, implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death should it happen. The rest of SAMCRO, enroute to prison, celebrate their victory over Jimmy and Stahl.\n\nReception\nIGN voted Agent Stahl's death #10 in their list of the biggest deaths, They said: \"The ending of Season 3 was one of the more gratifying twists the show ever had. Things seemed bleak when Agent Stahl informed the club that Jax had made a deal and ratted them out. But what she didn\u2019t know was that it was all a setup, one that ended with her dead as Opie got his revenge for her setting him up and getting his wife killed. The season ended on an unexpectedly up note as Clay and Jax smiled and the rest of the guys in the prison van shared a laugh. Sure they were on their way to prison, but Jax wasn\u2019t a rat and Stahl was out of the picture for good.\"\n\nZach Handler of The A.V. Club gave \"NS\" an A- rating, stating; \"What worked the best about 'NS' and what allows me to be optimistic about next season's potential, even while having largely mixed feelings on this season overall, is the ending. The episode doesn't manage to make all the IRA stuff feel organic, and Hal Holbrook doesn't pop back in to remind us about that basically innocent housekeeper that got murdered a while back, but it does introduce a new threat to the Sons, and, unlike Cameron and his Disappearing Baby Trick, this threat fits in beautifully with the context of the show overall. Maureen smuggled John's letters to her in Jax's backpack, and Tara found them. Reading them, while Jax and Clay grin at each other in triumph and while Gemma sits with her grandson in her arms, propped up like a queen on her throne, we hear Teller's voice-over again. It's long been hinted at that Clay and Gemma had something to do with John's death. This is a Hamlet riff, after all. And now Tara, the outsider who finally found her way to belonging, has reason to be suspicious. Makes you wonder what else is in those letters.

The album was recorded at the same sessions as the album Speakin' My Piece, by the same musicians, but with the addition of Landsbury Hill, which was originally issued on the ZBS Foundation label as part of the Cassette Box Set, ZBS Foundation Recordings. The Roland Kirk Quintette had been together for four years, having formed in 1956. The members were George Bell, a jazz musician and educator who had previously played with Lionel Hampton, Roosevelt \"Baby\" Dodds, and others; Joe Roland, who had played with Johnny Hodges, Lucky Millinder, and others; Herbie Steward, who had played with John Coltrane and others; and Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown, who had played with Joe \"Mr. Piano\" Johnston and others. In addition to the group's usual five members, the sessions featured an unknown musician, who was described in the liner notes as \"a very talented bass player\". The musician was probably Richard Evans, who was the only other person to have been involved in both the 1959 and 1960 sessions.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58795847}

At different times, it could be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor, by the Imperial Diet, or by courts like the League of the Holy Court (Vehmgericht) or the Reichskammergericht.\n\nPeople under imperial ban, known as Ge\u00e4chtete (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as Vogelfreie, lit. \"free as a bird\"), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the excommunication of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.\n\nThose banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The Aberacht, a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed.\n\nThe imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole Imperial Estates. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its Imperial immediacy and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor.\n\nFamous people placed under the imperial ban included:\n\n 1180 Henry the Lion, for refusing military support to Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor against the cities of the Lombard League.\n 1225 Count Frederick of Isenberg, for killing his uncle Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne.\n 1235 King Henry (VII) of Germany, for his rebellion against his father the Emperor Frederick II.\n 1276 King Ottokar II of Bohemia, for his capture of imperial lands from Rudolph I.\n 1309 John Parricida, for the murder of his uncle King Albert I of Germany.\n 1415 Frederick IV, Duke of Austria for aiding the flight of Antipope John XXIII from the Council of Constance.\n 1512 and 1518 G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, the first time for robbery, the second for kidnapping.\n 1521 Martin Luther and his supporters, for claiming that some doctrines practiced by the Catholic Church were contrary to the Bible or had no biblical basis.\n 1546 John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, for leading the Schmalkaldic League.\n 1566 Wilhelm von Grumbach, for insurgency.\n 1621 Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and his supporters Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg and Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim, for seizing power in Bohemia.\n 1706 Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Joseph Clemens, Elector of Cologne, for supporting France in the War of the Spanish Succession (ban reversed in 1714)\n 1793 Georg Forster, for collaboration with the French Republic.\n\nThe imperial ban imposed by the Emperor Rudolf II on the city of Donauw\u00f6rth after an anti-Catholic riot was one of the incidents leading to the Thirty Years' War.\n\nAn imperial ban on Bremen preceded the 1654 Swedish attack on Bremen.\n\nSee also \n King's ban, a royal order or prohibition in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nReferences \n\nPunishments\nLegal history of the Holy Roman Empire", "machine_text": " Imperial ban An imperial ban was a form of punishment in the Holy Roman Empire. A person who committed a crime could be \"banished from the Empire\" (Latin: Reichs Bann, German: Reichs Bann). The person was then considered to be outside the law, and no one was allowed to give him aid or shelter. This could also be enforced against entire families or tribes. Sometimes an imperial ban was issued with the reasoning that the person or group was believed to be in league with the devil. In this case, the person was banned from the Holy Roman Empire, the Christian community, and the Catholic Church. The imperial ban was not only a punishment, but also a way to ensure that the person would not be able to commit further crimes. The imperial ban was not a penalty that could be enforced by a single sovereign. It had to be enforced by the entire Empire. For this reason, the imperial ban was only used very rarely, and only for the most serious crimes. An imperial ban could be imposed by the Emperor alone or by an Imperial Diet (assembly of the Imperial Estates). The imperial ban was most commonly used to punish those who had betrayed the Empire or who had tried to weaken it. For example, after the Thirty Years' War, the imperial ban was imposed on the king of Sweden, Gustav II Adolf, who had broken the peace, and on the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian I, who had betrayed the Empire. The imperial ban could also be used as a preventive measure, to ensure that a person or group did not commit a crime. For example, the imperial ban was imposed on the margravine of Bayreuth, Marie, who was believed to be plotting against the Empire. The imperial ban could also be used as a way to remove a person or group from the Empire. For example, the imperial ban was imposed on the margravine of Bayreuth, Marie, who was believed to be a threat to the Empire. The imperial ban was not only used against people, but also against entire territories. For example, the imperial ban was imposed on the margravate of Bayreuth, which was believed to be a threat to the Empire. The imperial ban was not only used against people and territories within the Empire, but also against people and territories outside the Empire. For example, the imperial ban was imposed on the king of Sweden, Gustav II Adolf, who was believed to be a threat to the Empire.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1962927}

Some breeds from outside the country were introduced in the 1950s but did not bring beneficial results, so the Guizhou is still bred in pure form and is classified as a native breed.\n\nUses\n\nIn plantation areas the horses were used mainly for cultivation and transport. In hilly regions this breed has always been a good pack horse, somewhat smaller than the type used for agricultural purposes. The Guizhou horse is active and vigorous, good for travel in hilly regions, and can trot at a steady speed for long distances. This breed is the main power source for the mountain farmers.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nApproximately half of the Guizhou horses are bay or chestnut, others being gray, black, and dun. This horse is compact and short bodied with a solid build. The head has a straight profile, ears small and set up. In the riding type the neck tends to be sloped, while the pack type has a level neck. The withers are medium in height and length; the chest is of good width and depth; the rump is short and sloping but well muscled; the shoulder is short and tends to be straight. The forelegs have good posture while the hind legs are often sickled; the hoof is solid and tough and shoes are unnecessary even in the mountains. The skin is thin; mane and tail are think. Guizhou horses are willing and obedient and have a kind, patient temperament.\n\nSee also\n\n Chinese Guoxia\n Heihe (horse)\n Lijiang pony\n\nReferences\n\n Hendricks, Bonnie.

The term is used to distinguish these animals from the larger, draft-oriented Chinese breeds. The Guizhou breeds are bred for riding, pack work, or both. The Guizhou pony is a small, compact, and agile horse. The head is relatively large, with a straight or slightly convex profile. The neck is of medium length, and the shoulder is fairly upright. The body is short and stocky, with a broad, flat back and a deep, narrow chest. The legs are short and sturdy, with small, tough hooves. The mane and tail are often sparse. The Guizhou pony is found in several colors, including bay, black, brown, and gray. Some individuals may be dappled. The coat is usually short and sleek, and may be either straight or curly. The Guizhou pony is indigenous to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. It is used for both riding and pack work, and is known for its sure-footedness, endurance, and willingness to work. The Guizhou pony is also used for racing and other performance events. The Guizhou pony is generally considered to be a healthy and robust breed, but it is susceptible to the same diseases and health problems as other horses, including colic, laminitis, and hoof problems. The Guizhou pony is generally kept on a grass-based diet, although some supplemental feeding may be necessary during periods of drought or low grass growth. The Guizhou pony is typically bred by private farmers and breeders, rather than by large-scale commercial operations. Breeding stock is often selected for conformation, color, and performance. Some selective breeding may be done to improve the breed, but the primary goal is usually to produce animals that are suitable for riding or pack work.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15149947}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Third Mind Records\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Third Mind Records was a British independent record label, founded in February 1983 by Gary Levermore.\n\nName\nThe label derived its name from the book The Third Mind, a work compiled by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and artist Brion Gysin using the cut-up technique.\n\nHistory\nThird Mind originated from the group and fanzine Tone Death that Levermore had founded in the middle of 1982 together with two friends. During that time Levermore started contacting bands he had discovered through diverse media and on concerts which would finally be featured in Tone Death. While writing the editorial for the second issue of the fanzine, to be released around February 1983, Levermore \"began considering the possibility of releasing a cassette containing contributions by some of the groups that had been featured in the two issues to date.\" His considerations led to the double cassette release Rising From The Red Sand Vols. I&II which was followed by volumes III and IV in 1983. The compilations featured a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial bands some of which would be later on the label's roster, and sped up Levermore's \"transition from zine enthusiast into label owner.\"\n\nThe Rising From The Red Sand series was met with stronger demands than Levermore had anticipated. Sending promo copies to some shops and getting a five star review in Sounds magazine led to a great number of order requests. The London-based shop of Rough Trade ordered a substantial number of copies. \"Those compilations sold quite well\", remembered Levermore, \"and more or less provided the fund base to actually put out three or four albums.\"\n\nAfter this initial success Third Mind developed slowly, with an annual quantity of seven or eight records in the first years. Levermore had to deal with tight budgets, the label's artists recorded \"for very, very low sums of money.\" Signing Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly and British singer-songwriter Bill Pritchard in 1987 meant a major step forward for the label making them the label's flagships in different markets and entailing also further post-Third Mind management duties.\n\nAll of the label's releases until after Front Line Assembly's 1990 album Caustic Grip were licensed to American independent label Wax Trax.\n\nThird Mind started off with Rough Trade as distributor which changed between 1987 and 1988 when the label switched to Play It Again Sam. Due to \"policy differences\" Third Mind and Play It Again Sam terminated their partnership and in 1992 Levermore moved on to partner with American metal label Roadrunner Records. In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore \"a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases.\" Before Roadrunner, Levermore said, \"there's been many occasions over the years when I've seen a band that I wanted to work with go somewhere else and have a bit of success.\"\n\nLevermore and Roadrunner ended their collaboration in April 1994. When Third Mind ended its business activities in the same year, it had released more than 100 titles. The rights to all releases passed over to Roadrunner.\n\nFourth Dimension Records\nIn 1983 Levermore started Fourth Dimension Records as an offshoot of Third Mind. After two releases he handed over business to Richard Johnson from British fanzine Grim Humour. The second release was born out of collaboration between Levermore and Johnson as flexi disc for Grim Humour. Johnson had already thought about starting a label by himself and \"when Gary told me he wouldn\u2019t be operating FD after this second release, it just made sense for me to continue with the name.\"\n\nArtists\n\nSee also \n List of record labels\n\nReferences\n\nBritish independent record labels\nRecord labels established in 1983\nIndustrial record labels\nElectronic music record labels\nNew wave record labels\nCassette culture 1970s\u20131990s", "machine_text": " Third Mind Records is an American independent record label, founded in 1993 in San Francisco, California, by Gary Richards, a former employee of 415 Records.

Third Mind was originally conceived as a vehicle for releasing experimental music. Its first release was an album by the band Swingin' Neckbones, entitled Hot Box, which was released in 1993. In 1995, the label released a series of albums by Spacemen 3, a band from Rugby, Warwickshire, England, which was the first of several bands to sign to Third Mind from the UK. The Spacemen 3 releases were repackaged and re-released by Sony Music's Epic Records in 1996. The label released The Brian Jonestown Massacre's first three albums, and their self-titled album is often considered to be Third Mind's most well-known release. In 1996, Third Mind released the first Jesus and Mary Chain album since their original breakup, entitled Stoned & Dethroned. The label also released the first new Electric Prunes material since the band's original breakup, a single entitled \"Shine on Me\" in 1996. The Electric Prunes subsequently released a full-length album, Martinis and Bikinis, on Third Mind in 1998. In 1997, Third Mind released an album by The Bevis Frond, and a live album by The Church.

The council amalgamated with the City of Geraldton in 2007 to form the City of Geraldton-Greenough. On 1 July 2011 it became part of the City of Greater Geraldton.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Shire of Greenough originated as the Geraldton-Greenough Road District, which was established on 21 December 1951 with the amalgamation of the Geraldton Road District and the Greenough Road District. It was declared a shire as the Shire of Geraldton-Greenough with effect from 1 July 1961 following the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires.

The shire was created on 30 January 1955 out of the former Greenough Road Board. Greenough is located in the heart of the Wheatbelt, approximately 220 kilometres (140 mi) south-east of Perth, the state capital. It is bounded to the north by the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu, to the south by the Shire of Brookton, to the west by the Shire of Quairading and to the east by the shires of Bruce Rock and Westonia. The Greenough River flows through the shire from west to east, and the Avon River forms part of the shire's southern boundary. The economy of the shire is based on agriculture, with the main activities being wheat farming and sheep farming. The area was settled by farmers in the early 1900s after the Western Australian Government offered land to immigrants. The first wheat farm in the area was established in 1908 by Charles Cross. The shire has two main population centres, Greenough and Wandering. Greenough, the larger of the two, is situated on the coast and is the location of the shire's administration. It is also the location of the Greenough Museum and Gallery, and the Dr E.J. Aquinas College. Wandering is situated on the railway between Kellerberrin and Albany, and is the location of Wandering Primary School. The Greenough Shire has a number of historic buildings, including the Federation style Greenough Hotel, the Greenough Road Board Office (1903), and the Greenough Wheat Sheaf Hotel (1905), which was moved to the site in 1908. The Greenough area was first settled in the 1830s, and was the site of several murders and conflicts between the British and Aboriginal people. A number of the area's early settlers were Irish, and the area is the location of a number of Irish-themed events which are held annually.

He was the leading baritone of the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO) from 1896\u20131918, and thereafter sang roles periodically with the company until his last stage performance in 1938. From 1923-1939 he served as the director of the RSO. He also sang leading roles as a guest artist with opera companies internationally, drawing particular acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni.\n\nIn 1899, Forsell was awarded the Litteris et Artibus and, a decade later, he was named a Hovs\u00e5ngare. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music awarded him membership in 1906.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Stockholm, Forsell was the son of Carl August Forsell, a sea captain, and Axeline Forsell (n\u00e9e \u00c5berg). Before his singing career, he served in the Swedish Army; becoming a second lieutenant in 1890 and lieutenant in 1896. In 1897 he requested and was granted an honorable dismissal from the army, but continue to serve as a member of the Uppland Regiment reserves through 1901.\n\nWhile serving in the army, he pursued voice studies with Julius G\u00fcnther (1818\u20131904) at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm from 1892-1894. After graduating from college he studied singing further in Paris in 1895-1896 and later in Stockholm with Hedvig Willman (1841\u20131887) and Signe Hebbe (1837\u20131925).\n\nSinging career\nForsell made his operatic debut at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, in 1896 as Figaro in The Barber of Seville. He would remain that opera house's premier baritone through 1918, and thereafter appeared only periodically at that theatre up until his retirement from the stage in 1938. He sang in several world premieres with the company, including Wilhelm Stenhammar's Tirfing (1898) and Andreas Hall\u00e9n's Valdemarskatten (1899, the title role of Valdemar IV of Denmark). He also appeared in the Swedish premieres of Eugene Onegin (1903, title role), Tosca (1904, Scarpia), and Salome (1909, Jochanaan).\n\nForsell also established an international career. From 1902-1906 he sang regularly at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. In 1909-1910 he appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, performing such parts as Tonio in Pagliacci, Amfortas in Parsifal, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Telramund in Lohengrin, Germont in La traviata and Yeletsky in the United States premiere of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades.\n\nThe title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni was probably his most famous interpretation. He sang the part numerous times, including during the 1909 season at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, and at the 1930 Salzburg Festival. Other major opera houses in which Forsell sang the Don and various leading parts were the Berlin State Opera, the Dutch National Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. In 1915 he portrayed the role of the Foreigner/Francesco del Giocondo in the world premiere of Max von Schillings's Mona Lisa at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.\n\nOpera director, teacher, and later life\nForsell become the Director (Intendant) of the Royal Swedish Opera at the start of the 1923-1924 season, and performed less frequently on stage as a consequence. His voice, however, remained in fine condition. His final opera performance was on his 70th birthday when he sang the role of Count Almaviva in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the RSO. He retired from his director's position in May 1939 and died in Stockholm two years later. His wife, soprano Gurli Carlstr\u00f6m (married 1901), pre-deceased him in 1935. Their son, Bj\u00f6rn Forsell, was also a successful opera singer.\n\nIn addition to his administrative duties at Stockholm's opera house during the 1920s and '30s, Forsell taught voice as a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. His pupils included Joel Berglund, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling, Magna Lykseth-Scherfven, Aksel Schi\u00f8tz, Hj\u00f6rdis Schymberg, Set Svanholm, and Inez Wassner.\n\nRecordings\nForsell's gramophone legacy consists of several batches of acoustic 78-rpm discs of arias and songs (made initially by the Gramophone & Typewriter Company prior to World War I) and some subsequent electrical recordings of live stage performances. Many of these recordings are available on modern CD reissues, most notably a four-disc anthology produced in 1994 by Caprice Records (CAP 21586).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Adityavarman (Chalukya dynasty)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Adityavarman (r. c. 643\u2013645\u00a0CE) was a king of the Chalukya dynasty of Vatapi in southern India. He was a son of Pulakeshin II, who was defeated and probably killed when the Pallavas invaded and captured the Chalukya capital Vatapi. The immediate history of the dynasty after Pulakeshin's death is not clear, but inscriptions of Adityavarman and his son suggest that Adityavarman ruled a weakened Chalukya kingdom for a short period, before his younger brother Vikramaditya I defeated the Pallavas and restored the Chalukya power.\n\nBackground \n\nAdityavarman was one of the sons of the Chalukya emperor Pulakeshin II. In 642\u2013643\u00a0CE, the Pallavas, who were the southern neighbours of the Chalukyas, invaded and captured the Chalukya capital Vatapi. Pulakeshin was probably killed in this conflict.\n\nThe history of the Chalukya dynasty over the next decade, when Pulakeshin's other son Vikramaditya I ascended the throne in c. 655, is not clear. It cannot be said with certainty if the Chalukya empire was divided among the various sons of Pulakeshin, or if his successor(s) ruled from other headquarter(s) while the Pallavas occupied Vatapi. Despite this uncertainty, Adityavarman's existence and his rule as the Chalukya king is attested by his Kurnool (Karnul) grant inscription, his son's Nelakunda grant inscription, Someshvara III's Vikramankabhyudaya, and Sarvajnatma's Samkshepa-Shariraka.\n\nThe Kurnool inscription does not mention Adityavarman's order of birth among Pulakeshin's sons, and does not mention Vikramaditya.\n\nThe 1009\u00a0CE Kantheru grant inscription of the later Chalukyas of Kalyani, who claimed descent from the Chalukyas of Badami, names Adityavarman as a son of Nedamari and a grandson of Pulakeshin II. However, this late account contains several inaccuracies, and cannot be considered as reliable.\n\nReign \n\nVikramankabhyudaya of the 12th century king Someshvara III, whose dynasty claimed descent from the Chalukyas of Vatapi, states that Adityavarman succeeded his father Pulakeshin.\n\nAccording to the Kurnool and Nelakunda inscriptions, Adityavarman bore the regnal titles Shri-prithvi-vallabha, Maharajadhiraja, and Parameshvara (\"Supreme Lord\").\n\nThe Kurnool inscription boasts that he possessed the \"supreme rule over the whole circuit of earth which had been overcome by the strength of his arm and prowess\".\n\nThe Kurnool grant inscription is dated to Adityavarman's first regnal year: historian D. P. Dikshit assumes that he may have ruled during c. 643\u2013645\u00a0CE, spending most of his time trying to regain the former Chalukya territory from the Pallavas and other enemies. Historian D. C. Sircar theorized that Vikramaditya I and Adityavarman ruled different parts of the Pulakeshin's former empire simultaneously.\n\nIdentification as Vikramditya I \n\nHistorian T. V. Mahalingam theorized that Adityavarman was simply a former name of Vikramaditya I. His theory is based on the following arguments:\n\n Adityavarman's Kurnool inscription and Vikramaditya's Gadval inscription feature similar phraseology.\n Adityavarman's Kurnool inscription states that he made the grant for \"the merit of his mother and father and himself\". Such a statement is found in Vikramaditya's Kurnool inscriptions as well, but is uncommon in the inscriptions of other Chalukya kings. The Navsari inscription of Vikramaditya's younger brother Jayasimha also mentions that Vikramaditya \"meditated on the feet of his mother and father\": such an expression is not found in other Chalukya records.\n The Chalukya inscriptions issued after the restoration of the Chalukya power mention that Vikramaditya acquired the title Parameshvara (\"Supreme Lord\") by subjugating the hostile kings. Adityavarman also bore the title Parameshvara.\n\nHistorian D. P. Dikshit disputes this identification based on the following arguments:\n\n The similarity between the inscriptions of the succeeding kings can be explained by the fact that such records were drafted by state officials on the lines of the previous records.\n The grant inscriptions only furnish a genealogy of the king, not a chronology of succession. This explains why Adityavarman's records do not mention Vikramaditya, and vice versa.\n The records of the later Chalukyas of Kalyani, although unreliable, mention Adityavarman. Had Adityavarman not been a distinct, sovereign king, he would have been forgotten by the time of the later Chalukyas.\n The Nelakunda inscription of Adityavarman's son Abhinavaditya suggests that both men were sovereign rulers, and that Abhinavadiya succeeded Adityavarman.\n\nSuccessor \n\nThe Nelakunda inscription of Adityavarman's son Abhinavaditya gives both men the imperial title Parameshvara, which suggests that Abhinavaditya succeeded his father as the Chalukya sovereign.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n\nEarly Chalukyas", "machine_text": " Adityavarman was a Chalukya king, who ruled in the early 6th century. He was the son of king Kirttivarman and queen Bhadrechi. According to the Chronicle of the Chalukya Kings, Adityavarman ruled for a very short period, as his predecessor, his father Kirttivarman, was a very old man at the time of his death. Adityavarman was succeeded by his brother, Mangalesa. The relationship of Adityavarman with his predecessors and successors is uncertain. The Bayyaram tank inscription, issued during the reign of his son Mangalesa, describes Adityavarman as a \"son of the daughter of the king of Vatsagulma\". The Vatsagulma kings were the ancestors of the Chalukyas, but Adityavarman was not the direct heir of the Vatsagulma family. The same inscription describes Mangalesa as a \"son of the daughter of the king of Ellam\". The identity of Ellam is uncertain, but it is possible that Mangalesa was a son of a king of the Western Ganga family, who had married a daughter of the Vatsagulma king. The Peddavaduguru inscription, issued during the reign of Adityavarman's grandson Mangalesha, states that Mangalesa's mother was a Vatsagulma princess. It is possible that Mangalesa's mother was Adityavarman's sister, rather than his wife. If this interpretation is correct, then Adityavarman married into the Vatsagulma family, and Mangalesa married into the Western Ganga family. The Peddavaduguru inscription further states that Adityavarman was the son of Kirttivarman, and that his grandfather was Avinita, who was the son of a king named Jayasena. The identification of Avinita is uncertain, but he could have been a brother of the Vatsagulma king.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59426574}

As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,428, making it the second-least populous county in Pennsylvania. Its county seat is Laporte. The county was created on March 15, 1847, from part of Lycoming County and named for Charles C. Sullivan, leader of the Pennsylvania Senate at that time.\n\nHistory\nThe land which became Sullivan County was originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. It was then part of Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Sullivan County itself was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847. It was the thirteenth and last county formed at least partly from Lycoming County (and the fifth entirely formed from it).\n\nAccording to the official state publication Pennsylvania Local Government, Sullivan County was named for Pennsylvania state senator Charles C. Sullivan, who \"took an active part in procuring passage of the bill\" establishing the county. However, according to Frederic A. Godcharles (1933), the county is named for General John Sullivan, who led the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois in 1779.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.6%) is water.\n\nElevation ranges from 2593\u00a0ft at North Mountain in Davidson Township to 779\u00a0ft on Loyalsock Creek at the Lycoming County line. The county is served by Pennsylvania Route 42, Pennsylvania Route 87, Pennsylvania Route 154, Pennsylvania Route 487, and U.S. Route 220. The major rivers in the county are Loyalsock Creek, Little Loyalsock Creek, Muncy Creek, and Fishing Creek. The majority of the land in Sullivan County is forest, but there is some farmland, especially in the northern part of the county. There are numerous river valleys in the southern and western parts of  Sullivan County.\n\nSullivan has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) and average monthly temperatures in Laporte range from 21.8\u00a0\u00b0F in January to 67.9\u00a0\u00b0F in July.\n\nAdjacent counties\nBradford County (north)\nWyoming County (east)\nLuzerne County (southeast)\nColumbia County (south)\nLycoming County (west)\n\nGeology\nSullivan County lies predominantly within the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province, which is characterized by gently folded and faulted sedimentary rocks of middle to late Paleozoic age. The southern border of the county is approximately at the Allegheny Front, a geological boundary between the Ridge and Valley province and the plateau. (PA Geologic Survey Map 13).  The mountains within the county are part of the Endless Mountains.\n\nThe stratigraphic record of sedimentary rocks within the county spans from the Devonian Lock Haven Formation (exposed only in Lick Creek valley) to the coal-bearing Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation.  Generally, the Catskill Formation underlies most of the lowlands, and sandstones of the Huntley Mountain, Burgoon, Mauch Chunk, or Pottsville Formations cap the mountains.  No igneous or metamorphic rocks exist within the county, other than possible glacial erratics.\n\nStructurally, the bedrock of Sullivan County is gently folded, with the axes of two major anticlines (including the Wilmot Anticline) and two major synclines (Bernice-Mehoopany Syncline and Noxen Syncline) each trending roughly east\u2013west.  There are three mapped faults in the Allegheny Formation between the towns of Murray and Ringdale.\n\nNearly all of Sullivan County was glaciated several times in the past, during the Pleistocene epoch, or \"Ice Age.\" (PA Geologic Survey Map 59).  Most of the county is covered by glacial till of Late Wisconsinan age.  Late Illinoian Stage deposits may underlie the Late Wisconsinan deposits, and these are exposed in the south central part of the county (roughly western Davidson Township).\n\nThe major rivers in Sullivan County are Loyalsock Creek and Muncy Creek.  Both flow into the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.  Some streams along the eastern border of the county flow into the North Branch of the Susquehanna River.  All of Sullivan county is thus within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\n\nSeveral small coal fields exist within Sullivan County. The fields contain either bituminous or semi-anthracite coal, and all occur within Pennsylvanian strata.\n\nNotable geologic features within Sullivan County include some of the following:\n The Haystacks (Huntley Mountain Formation), exposed along Loyalsock Creek south of Dushore, are sandstone mounds of unknown origin\n Ganoga Lake is the state's highest lake at 2265\u00a0ft above sea level\n Ricketts Glen State Park, with its many waterfalls\n Worlds End State Park, including an exposure of the Huntley Mountain Formation, and a \"rock city\" where cross-bedding is visible in the sandstone of the Pottsville Formation\n The Leberfinger Quarry (on Millview Mountain Rd northeast of Forksville), in the Lock Haven Formation where brachiopod fossils, trace fossils, and plant fossils can be observed\n Grand View, located at the southeast corner of the county on a knob of Red Rock Mountain, provides scenic views of the Allegheny Front\n\n Ticklish Rock, located near Glen Mawr up Rock Run Road, features a rock formation of the Devonian Catskill Formation.\n\nMountains\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 6,556 people, 2,660 households, and 1,752 families residing in the county.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harvey armor\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harvey armor was a type of steel naval armor developed in the early 1890s in which the front surfaces of the plates were case hardened. The method for doing this was known as the Harvey process, and was invented by the American engineer Hayward Augustus Harvey.\n\nThis type of armor was used in the construction of capital ships until superseded by Krupp armor in the late 1890s.  \n\nThe Harvey United Steel Company was a steel cartel whose chairman was Albert Vickers. The year 1894 would see the ten main producers of armor plate, including Vickers, Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, Carnegie and Bethlehem Steel, form the Harvey Syndicate.\n\nPredecessors \nBefore the appearance of compound armor in the 1880s, armor plating  was made from uniform homogeneous iron or steel plates backed by several inches of teak to absorb the shock of projectile impact.  Compound armor appeared in the mid-1880s and was made from two different types of steel, a very hard but brittle high-carbon steel front plate backed by a more elastic low-carbon wrought iron plate.  The front plate was intended to break up an incoming shell, while the rear plate would catch any splinters and hold the armor together if the brittle front plate shattered.\n\nCompound armor was made by pouring molten steel between a red-hot wrought iron backing plate and a hardened steel front plate to weld them together.  This process produced a sharp transition between the properties of the two plates in a very small distance. As  consequence, the two plates could separate when struck by a shell, and the rear plate was often not elastic enough to stop the splinters. With the discovery of nickel-steel alloys in 1889, compound armor was rendered obsolete.\n\nProduction process \nHarvey armor used a single plate of steel, but re-introduced the benefits of compound armor. The front surface was converted to high carbon steel by \"cementing\". In this process, the steel plate would be covered with charcoal and heated to approximately 1200 degrees Celsius for two to three weeks. The process increased the carbon content at the face to around 1 percent; the carbon content decreasing gradually from this level with distance into the plate, reaching the original proportion (approximately 0.1\u20130.2 percent) at a depth of around an inch. After cementing, the plate was chilled first in an oil bath, then in a water bath, before being annealed to toughen the  back of the plate. The water bath was later replaced with jets of water to prevent the formation of a layer of steam which would insulate the steel from the cooling effect of the water. The process was further improved by low temperature forging of the plate before the final heat treatment.\n\nWhile the American navy used nickel steel for Harvey armor (roughly 0.2 percent carbon, 0.6 percent manganese, 3.5 percent nickel), the British used normal steels since their tests had shown that ordinary steel subjected to the Harvey process had the same resistance to penetration as nickel steel, although it was not quite as tough.\n\nHarvey armor was taken up by all of the major navies, since  of Harvey armor offered the same protection as  of nickel-steel armor.  It was in turn rendered obsolete by the development of Krupp armor in the late 1890s.\n\nSee also\n\nCarburizing\n\nReferences\n\nGene Slover's US Navy Pages - Naval Ordnance and Gunnery\n\nNaval armour", "machine_text": " Harvey armor The Harvey armor (also known as the Harvey house) is a distinctive style of domestic architecture that developed in the United States during the early 20th century. The Harvey brothers, architect Royal Barry Wills and their associates, and later George Fred Keck and his associates, designed and built a series of homes in the style from the early 1920s through the early 1940s. The houses were constructed using a method called \"post and beam\" with exterior walls that were typically 1/2-inch-thick (12.7 mm) steel-cased windows; the name \"Harvey house\" also refers to this method of construction. The houses were usually two-story structures with a full basement. The style is characterized by a low-pitched roof, a balanced and symmetrical facade, and a front-facing gable. The Harvey brothers began their architectural career in the early 1920s, designing and building a series of single-family homes in the Chicago area. In the late 1920s, they began to expand their business, and their designs became more elaborate and luxurious. In the early 1930s, they opened offices in New York City and Los Angeles, and their work began to be published in national magazines. The Harvey brothers' most famous house is the so-called \"Harvey house\" in Los Angeles, which was built in 1934 and designed by George Fred Keck. The house is a three-story, 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) mansion with a two-story, glass-enclosed solarium. The house was featured in the 1938 movie The Harvey Girls, and was the inspiration for the popular \"Barbie doll\" house.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3989449}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jurisdiction stripping\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In United States law, jurisdiction-stripping (also called court-stripping or curtailment-of-jurisdiction), is the limiting or reducing of a court's jurisdiction by Congress through its constitutional authority to determine the jurisdiction of federal and state courts.\n\nBasis\nCongress may define the jurisdiction of the judiciary through the simultaneous use of two powers. First, Congress holds the power to create (and, implicitly, to define the jurisdiction of) federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court (i.e. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and various other Article I and Article III tribunals).  This court-creating power is granted both in the congressional powers clause (Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 9) and in the judicial vesting clause (Art. III, \u00a7 1). Second, Congress has the power to make exceptions to and regulations of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  This court-limiting power is granted in the Exceptions Clause (Art. III, \u00a7 2).  By exercising these powers in concert, Congress may effectively eliminate any judicial review of certain federal legislative or executive actions and of certain state actions, or alternatively transfer the judicial review responsibility to state courts by \"knocking [federal courts] ... out of the game.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton had this to say about the issue in The Federalist:\n\nFrom this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the system.  If some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences.\n\nTransfer of authority to state judiciaries\nFramers of the Constitution, such as Roger Sherman of Connecticut, did not envision jurisdiction stripping as invariably insulating a law from judicial review, and instead foresaw that state judiciaries could determine compatibility of certain types of state statutes with federal laws and the federal Constitution.  In 1788, Sherman publicly explained that,\n\nIt was thought necessary in order to carry into effect the laws of the Union, to promote justice, and preserve harmony among the states, to extend the judicial powers of the United States to the enumerated cases, under such regulations and with such exceptions as shall be provided by law, which will doubtless reduce them to cases of such magnitude and importance as cannot be safely trusted to the final decisions of the courts of particular states; and the constitution does not make it necessary that any inferior tribunals should be instituted, but it may be done if found necessary; 'tis probable that courts of particular states will be authorized by the laws of the union, as has heretofore been done in cases of piracy, &c. ...\n\nThus, there are two kinds of jurisdiction-stripping: one which changes the court that will hear the case (as Sherman envisioned), versus one which essentially insulates statutes from judicial review altogether.  Jurisdiction-stripping statutes usually take away no substantive rights but rather change the court that will hear the case.\n\nCongress has sometimes limited federal involvement in state cases, for example by setting a minimum amount in controversy in order to bar the lower federal courts from hearing diversity cases that involve less than that amount (currently $75,000), combined with precluding a right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Likewise, Congress has never required that state court cases involving federal questions be removed or appealed to federal court, and so the federal courts are unable to exercise power in many of those cases.\n\nLimits\nCongress may not strip the U.S. Supreme Court of jurisdiction over those cases that fall under the Court's original jurisdiction defined in the U.S. Constitution. Congress can limit only the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in, \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party. ... \"  This last state-shall-be-a-party language has not been interpreted by the Court as meaning that it has original jurisdiction merely because a state is a plaintiff or defendant, even if a provision of the U.S. Constitution is at issue. Rather, the Court has started that the controversy must be between two or more states, or between a state and citizens of another state, or between a state and foreigners.  Additionally, in 1892, the Court decided that it has original jurisdiction in cases between a state and the United States.\n\nStory's theory\nJustice Joseph Story, in his opinion in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee and in his other writings, wrote extensively about how Congress should ensure that the judicial power is properly vested in the federal courts.  Professor Akhil Amar credits Story with the theory that Congress may not concurrently remove the jurisdiction of inferior courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over certain categories of claims, as doing so would violate the Constitution's mandatory grant of jurisdiction over such claims to the judiciary as a whole.  Story wrote in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee:\n\nThe judicial power shall extend to all the cases enumerated in the constitution.   As the mode is not limited, it may extend to all such cases, in any form, in which judicial power may be exercised.  It may, therefore, extend to them in the shape of original or appellate jurisdiction, or both; for there is nothing in the nature of the cases which binds to the exercise of the one in preference to the other.\n\nAccording to Amar, Story's exposition of federal court jurisdiction \"has generated considerable confusion\" and furthermore, as Amar understands Story's theory, it \"simply cannot be right\".  Professor Henry M. Hart instead argued that Congress may strip the power of the federal judiciary to hear certain classes of cases. Hart wrote: \"In the scheme of the Constitution [state courts] are the primary guarantors of constitutional rights, and in many cases they may be the ultimate ones.\"\n\nCalabresi's theory\nIn 2007, law professors Steven Calabresi and Gary Lawson opined that Congress can strip the U.S. Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction only to the extent that Congress expands the Court's original jurisdiction.  Calabresi and Lawson acknowledged that their theory contradicts the holding of Marbury v. Madison, according to which the Constitution's description of the Court's original jurisdiction is exhaustive.\n\nAccording to Calabresi and Lawson, Congress has no ability to alter or make exceptions to the judicial power of the United States, or to do anything less than bring the full judicial power into execution.  The Calabresi theory finds support in a 2010 article by Washburn University Law Professor Alex Glashausser.  On the other hand, Judge William A. Fletcher wrote an article in 2010 taking the opposite point of view.\n\nRelated issues\nGenerally speaking, the word \"power\" is not necessarily synonymous with the word \"jurisdiction\".  For instance, courts will often assert a modest degree of power over a case for purposes of determining whether it has jurisdiction, or for purposes of receiving jurisdiction.\n\nThe Constitution vests the judicial power \"in one supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time establish\" (emphasis added).  Scholars have debated whether the word \"in\" means that the entire judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and is also vested entirely in the inferior courts; that possibility has implications for what the vesting of such power means.\n\nOther relevant Supreme Court cases\nDuring Reconstruction, Congress withdrew jurisdiction from a case the U.S. Supreme Court was then in the process of adjudicating.  In terminating the case Ex Parte McCardle, 74 US 506 (1869), the Justices acknowledged the authority of Congress to intervene.\n\nWe are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature.  We can only examine into its power under the Constitution; and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words. ... It is quite clear, therefore, that this court cannot proceed to pronounce judgment in this case, for it has no longer jurisdiction of the appeal; and judicial duty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws confer.\n\nIn 1882, the Supreme Court again conceded that its own \"actual jurisdiction is confined within such limits as Congress sees fit to describe.\"\n\nIn 1948, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter conceded in a dissenting opinion that \"Congress need not give this Court any appellate power; it may withdraw appellate jurisdiction once conferred.\"\n\nIn 1972, Chief Justice Warren Burger made it known, concurring with the denial of certiorari to Volpe v. D. C. Federation of Civic Associations, that he believed Congress could do anything in its power to make its intentions clear, \"even to the point of limiting or prohibiting judicial review of its directives in this respect.\" This was recorded in reference to a particular dispute with a court of appeal, which he accused of \"unjustifiably frustrat[ing] the efforts of the Executive Branch to comply with the will of Congress.\" However, 10 days earlier, President Nixon had made a statement indicating his opposition to school busing for racial integration. In that context, Burger's statement was interpreted at the time as suggesting that Congress prohibit busing with legislation and enforce that legislation with jurisdiction stripping.\n\nFurther federal statutes\nMore recent examples of jurisdiction stripping include the following:\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (inter alia, stripped the federal judiciary of its jurisdiction to review certain Immigration and Naturalization Service decisions),\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (restricting the remedies available to prison inmates),\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (limiting the number of habeas corpus petitions available to prison inmates),\nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, ruled as unconstitutional denial of the right of habeas corpus pursuant to the Suspension clause in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006).\nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006 (Strip all Federal Courts of the U.S. jurisdiction to hear appeal or cases from Guantanamo Bay Detainee) Ruled Unconstitutional in the case of Boumediene v. Bush (2008).\n\nThere have also been hundreds of unsuccessful bills in Congress to strip federal courts of jurisdiction.\n\nSee also\nOuster clause\nSeparation of powers under the United States Constitution\n\nReferences\n\nJurisdiction\nUnited States constitutional law\nFederal judiciary of the United States\nTerminology of the United States Congress\nPolitical terminology of the United States", "machine_text": " Jurisdiction stripping is the legal term for the set of tactics in which a state reduces the sovereignty of another state. The state that is the victim of jurisdiction stripping is typically a small state, and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping is typically a large state. The term was coined by Robert Jackson in a 1981 article entitled \"The New UN Law of Self-Determination\". Jurisdiction stripping can take many forms. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may announce, for example, that it no longer recognizes the independence of the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's territory. Jurisdiction stripping is often accomplished by the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping by simply declaring that the victim state is no longer independent. The victim state may have a very small military force and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have a very large military force. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its large military force to occupy the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its large military force to occupy the victim state's territory. Once the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping has occupied the victim state or the victim state's territory, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's tax laws. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. There are many variations on jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may strip jurisdiction from another state with which it has a territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its own legal system to adjudicate the territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes involving the victim state. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to settle disputes over tax payments or other financial matters. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes over the victim state's natural resources. There are also many variations on the types of states that are guilty of jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not take over the victim state's government. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it uses its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws, but does not use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. The legal consequences of jurisdiction stripping can be severe. If a state strips another state of its sovereignty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's debts and liabilities. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's natural resources. In addition, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's international legal obligations. For example, if the victim state has signed onto an international treaty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of the treaty. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's relationships with other states. For example, if the victim state has diplomatic relations with other states, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of those relationships.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7890213}

There were 200 silk-weaving units in the city in 1991 with around 80,000 people working in them.[34] The sarees produced in the villages surrounding Thanjavur are sold in Thanjavur and neighbouring towns.[34] Increasing production costs and competition from large-scale producers have reduced the number of people involved in the production\n\nTransport\n\nPeikkarumbankottai, in modern times, is well-connected with Chennai, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Vellore, Erode, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai, Kumbakonam, Pattukkottai, Dindigul Pudukkottai, Tirunelveli, Bangalore, Ernakulam, Nagercoil, Tirupathi, Thiruvananthapuram, Ooty and through regular bus services. Previously, Thanjavur had a single bus terminus located at the heart of the city. The National Highways 67,[40] 45C,[40] 226[40] and 226 Extn[40] pass through the city. An integrated bus terminus, called New Busstand has been constructed near the Serafoji College in order to handle the passenger traffic. Thanjavur also has a well-maintained sub-urban public transport system. Government and private buses operate frequently between the two bus termini and other towns and villages like Vallam, Budalur, Pillaiyarpatti, Vallam Pudursethi, Sengipatti, Vadakkur North and Kuruvadipatti.\n\nPeikkarumbankottai is connected by rail with most important cities and towns in India. This district has 122.07 Kilometers of Broad gauge railway lines with 20 Railway stations connecting Thanjavur to Major centres in the state. There are daily trains from/to Chennai,[41][42][43] Bangalore,[44] Mysore,[41] Ernakulam,[45] Thrissur,[45] Palakkad,[45] Coimbatore,[41][45] Erode,[45] Tirupur,[45] Tiruchirapalli,[43] Salem, Karur,[45] Madurai, Tirunelveli, Rameswaram, Tiruchendur,[43] Dharmapuri and weekly trains to Tirupati, Visakhapatnam, Goa,[43] Vijayawada, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Bhubaneshwar[43][46] and to all main cities.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Peikkarumbankottai (Thanjavur) was connected with Chennai via the Vayudoot flight service, which was stopped due to poor patronage. A full-fledged Air Force Station is operational at Thanjavur which stations several Fighter (aircraft) including Sukhoi jets.[47] Thanjavur Air Force Station started functioning as a major air base by 2012,[48] The base will be developed to handle Fighter, Transport aircraft and also Refuelling aircraft.[48] The nearest Airport is Tiruchirapalli International Airport.\n\nEducation\n\nPeikkarumbankottai is well known for its culture and education. Peikkarumbankottai  (Thanjavur) has a total of 4 Universities as Tamil University,[72] SASTRA University,[73] PRIST University,[74] Periyar Maniammai University.[73] The Tamil University is a state run institute, started during 1981 and got the statutory recognition from the University Grants Commission in 1983.[75] It is one of its kind for the Tamil language doing higher research in Tamilology and advanced study in various other allied branches like linguistics, translation, lexicography, music, drama and manuscriptology.[75][76]\n\nPeikkarumbankottai (Thanjavur) has a total of 15 Arts, Science & Management colleges and 9 Engineering Colleges in the City. Thanjavur have its own Medical College as Thanjavur Medical College which was established in 1959. The Paddy Processing Research Centre (PPRC) later became the Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology (IICPT) in 2008 and is a hub for food processing research.\n\nReferences \n\nhttps://www.Peikkarumbankottaikallarkottai.blogspot.in\nhttps://www.facebook.com/peikkarumbankottai.kallarkottai\n\nVillages in Thanjavur district", "machine_text": " Peikkarambankottai is a village in the Cuddalore district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is located on the Coromandel Coast, 4 kilometres (2 mi) from the mouth of the Kaveri River. The village is one of the three major fishing centres in Tamil Nadu; the others are Poompuhar and K Careers. The coast off Peikkarambankottai is the breeding ground for several species of fish. The village has a population of 4,251 as of the 2011 census. Peikkarambankottai is known for the Battle of Peikkarambankottai, which was fought on 2 January 1754 between the British and the French during the First Carnatic War. The French had landed at Pondicherry in 1745 and had built a fort at Pondicherry and another at Yanam. The British had built a fort at Fort St. George, Madras. The French occupied the fort at Cuddalore in 1748, after the British had abandoned it. The British took it back in 1749, after the French were driven away by a small British fleet. The British then built a fort at Arcot, which the French attacked in 1751 and captured. The British then took it back in 1752. In 1753, the British built a new fort at Cuddalore. The French attacked it in 1754, but were unsuccessful. The British then took the fort at Pondicherry in 1757, after which the French abandoned it. Peikkarambankottai is also known for the Battle of Tuticorin, which was fought on 7 September 1772 between the British and the French during the Second Carnatic War. The French had built a fort at Tuticorin, which the British attacked in 1772. The French were successful in repelling the attack, but they were unable to prevent the British from building a fort at Cuddalore in 1776. The village is also known for the Sankarankovil temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is one of the oldest temples in the region. The temple is located at the end of the village and is built on a small hillock. It is a small temple, with a single shrine and a small courtyard. The temple is known for its beautiful architecture and its peaceful atmosphere.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23410396}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Continental collision\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In geology, continental collision is a phenomenon of plate tectonics that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth.\n\nContinental collision is not an instantaneous event, but may take several tens of millions of years before the faulting and folding caused by collisions stops. The collision between India and Asia has been going on for about 50\u00a0million years already and shows no signs of abating.  Collision between East and West Gondwana to form the East African Orogen took about 100\u00a0million years from beginning (610\u00a0Ma) to end (510\u00a0Ma). The collision between Gondwana and Laurasia to form Pangea occurred in a relatively brief interval, about 50\u00a0million years long.\n\nSubduction zone: the collision site\nThe process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone. The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today. Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries.  Oceanic crust is thin (~6\u00a0km thick) and dense (about 3.3\u00a0g/cm3), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite. Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench. In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45\u00a0km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.5\u00a0g/cm3). Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150\u00a0km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites. Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench. Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted. The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished. Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be. The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes. Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.\n\nDeep subduction of continental crust\nThe continental crust on the downgoing plate is deeply subducted as part of the downgoing plate during collision, defined as buoyant crust entering a subduction zone.  An unknown proportion of subducted continental crust returns to the surface as ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes, which contain metamorphic  coesite and/or diamond plus or minus unusual silicon-rich garnets and/or potassium-bearing pyroxenes.  The presence of these minerals demonstrate subduction of continental crust to at least 90\u2013140\u00a0km deep.  Examples of UHP terranes are known from the Dabie\u2013Sulu belt of east-central China, the Western Alps, the Himalaya of India, the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, the Bohemian Massif of Europe, the North Qaidam of Northwestern China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, and Mali.  Most UHP terranes consist of an imbricated sheets or nappes.  The fact that most UHP terranes consist of thin sheets suggests that much thicker, volumetrically dominant tracts of continental crust are more deeply subducted.\n\nOrogeny and collapse\n \nAn orogeny is underway when mountains begin to grow in the collision zone. There are other modes of mountain formation and orogeny but certainly continental collision is one of the most important. Rainfall and snowfall increase on the mountains as these rise, perhaps at a rate of a few millimeters per year (at a growth rate of 1\u00a0mm/year, a 5,000\u00a0m tall mountain can form in 5\u00a0million years, a time period that is less than 10% of the life of a typical collision zone). River systems form, and glaciers may grow on the highest peaks. Erosion accelerates as the mountains rise, and great volumes of sediment are shed into the rivers, which carry sediment away from the mountains to be deposited in sedimentary basins in the surrounding lowlands. Crustal rocks are thrust faulted over the sediments and the mountain belt broadens as it rises in height. A crustal root also develops, as required by isostasy; mountains can be high if underlain by thicker crust. Crustal thickening may happen as a result of crustal shortening or when one crust overthrusts the other. Thickening is accompanied by heating, so the crust becomes weaker as it thickens. The lower crust begins to flow and collapse under the growing mountain mass, forming rifts near the crest of the mountain range. The lower crust may partially melt, forming anatectic granites which then rise into the overlying units, forming granite intrusions. Crustal thickening provides one of two negative feedbacks on mountain growth in collision zones, the other being erosion. The popular notion that erosion is responsible for destroying mountains is only half correct - viscous flow of weak lower mantle also reduces relief with time, especially once the collision is complete and  the two continents are completely sutured.  Convergence between the continents continues because the crust is still being pulled down by oceanic lithosphere sinking in the subduction zone to either side of the collision as well as beneath the impinging continent. \n\nThe pace of mountain building associated with the collision is measured by radiometric dating of igneous rocks or units that have been metamorphosed during the collision and by examining the record of sediments shed from the rising mountains into the surrounding basins.  The pace of ancient convergence can be determined with paleomagnetic measurements, while the present rate of convergence can be measured with GPS.\n\nFar-field effects \nThe effects of the collision are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea and away from the collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.\n\nFossil collision zones\n\nContinental collisions are a critical part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called \"suture zones\" by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or sutured together.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nWhere Continents Collide\nDynamics of Continental Collision Zones\nThe Wilson Cycle\n\nPlate tectonics", "machine_text": " Continental collision A continental collision, also known as a continent-continent collision or Thrusting, is a tectonic event in which two or more continents collide. While this term is used mainly for describing the collision of two continents, it can also describe the collision of a continent and a subcontinent, and even the collision of two subcontinents. The most significant continental collisions are associated with the formation of mountains and the development of basins. The most important mountain belts are formed along the collisions of the following: - the Caledonian and Scando-gnemy ranges between the Baltica and the Anglo-Scandinavian shields; - the Appalachian and the Caledonian-Appalachian ranges between the Laurentia and the Anglo-Scandinavian shields; - the Hercynian and the Midlandian ranges between the Laurussia and the Western Australian Shield; - the Thompson and the Appalachian- Oraasian ranges between the Eurasiatic and North American cratons; - the Rocky and the Cordilleran ranges between the Laurentia and the Pacific craton; - the Taurus and the Zagros ranges between the Arabia and the Iranian craton; - the Alpine-Himalayan and the Hindukush-Karakoram ranges between the Indian and the Tibetan Plateau; - the Golden Gate and the Kaapvaal ranges between the South America and the African craton. The term \"continental collision\" was first used by the geophysicist Paul S. Taff at the California Institute of Technology in 1978 to describe the collision of the Australian and Asian continents. Taff used the term to explain the formation of the folding and thrusting that had created the mountain ranges of southeast Asia and the islands of the western Pacific. The term is now used more generally to describe any continent-continent collision. The process of a continent-continent collision is similar to the process of an ocean-continent collision, which is also known as an orogenic event. The main difference between the two processes is that an ocean-continent collision occurs along a convergent ocean boundary, while a continent-continent collision occurs along a convergent continent boundary. The same process of subduction and overthrusting occurs in both cases. Continent-continent collisions are more energetic and create higher mountains than ocean-continent collisions. This is because the continents are much more rigid and thick than the oceans, so the process of subduction and overthrusting is more intense. Also, the continents are more wide and the convergence is along a longer boundary, so the forces are more equally distributed along the boundary. The boundary between two colliding continents is known as a suture. The suture zone is the area where the two continents meet, and it is usually defined by the location of the main mountain ranges. The suture zone is also the location of most of the mineral deposits and economic resources of the region. The collision of two continents is a slow process that can take millions of years. The first stage of the collision is the formation of a collisional belt, which is a zone of folding and thrusting that is parallel to the boundary between the two continents. The collisional belt is the location of most of the deformation and the development of the mountain ranges. After the formation of the collisional belt, the two continents begin to overlap each other, and the boundary between the two continents becomes more complex. The next stage of the collision is the formation of a sinuous zone, which is a zone of irregular folding and thrusting that is perpendicular to the boundary between the two continents. The sinuous zone is the location of most of the strike-slip deformation and the development of the basins. Finally, the two continents are completely fused together, and the boundary between the two continents is no longer visible. The last stage of the collision is the formation of a stable craton, which is a large, stable block of the Earth's crust that is made up of two or more formerly separate continents. The stable craton is the location of most of the old, stable mountain ranges. The collision of two continents is a major event in the history of the Earth, and it has had a major impact on the development of the planet's geography. The collision of the two continents creates large mountain ranges and deep basins, and it changes the climate and the biology of the region. The collision of two continents is also a major cause of earthquakes and volcanic activity.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2076436}

(Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a Senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in New South Wales or Victoria.) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then Chief Minister Shane Stone, it is believed that most Territorians were reluctant to adopt the offer which was made.\n\nA bipartisan NT Legislative Assembly Committee, chaired by former Chief Minister Stephen Hatton, had proposed a draft Constitution and that it should be debated at an elected Constitutional Convention. Shane Stone ignored the latter recommendation, nominating a Convention membership of 53 members at short notice, and then presented to the Convention a draft Constitution that was different from the Committee's recommendation.

Several dozen species have been recorded, but the true number is unknown. Congolese butterflies are active during the day. The males are often territorial, and they defend their territories from other males. The females are often less colourful than the males. Most Congolese butterflies are solitary, but some species occasionally occur in groups. Many Congolese butterflies are threatened by habitat loss, and some are threatened with extinction. Congolese butterflies are important components of the Congolese ecosystem, and they are essential for the maintenance of the Congolese forests. A list of butterflies of the Republic of the Congo is presented in the following.

It was established in 1850 by the town of Brighton (which was annexed to Boston in 1874), and was laid out in the then-fashionable rural cemetery style inspired by Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Its entrance gate was built in 1892, and its Jacobethan office building was added in 1903. Boston architect James Mulcahy designed the office building.

The cemetery was established in 1860 by the city's Jewish community on a plot of land donated by Edward Everett. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The original parcel of land for the cemetery was 1.5 acres (0.61 ha). In 1928, a parcel of land 2.6 acres (1.1 ha) in size was added to the cemetery's holdings, and is known as the Fields of Spring. The expanded cemetery is now 4.6 acres (1.8 ha) in size. The cemetery was designed by Hammatt Billings, a prominent Boston landscape architect. The main gate is ornamented with a Star of David and an ammonite. The ammonite is a reference to the biblical story of the ammonites, in which the children of Israel are told to place a scroll of the Law inside a protective case. The scroll is meant to represent the body, and the case the grave. The Star of David serves as a reminder that the person buried within is Jewish. The cemetery is a traditional, non-denominational Jewish cemetery, and is open to people of all faiths for burial. It is the final resting place for many notable Bostonians, including Major General Benjamin Butler, a Union Army general during the Civil War who was known for his controversial policy of \"amputation resolutions\" that allowed him to execute or pardon those who had engaged in certain crimes against civilians; Samuel August, a German-born Bostonian who founded August Clocks, one of the city's oldest businesses; Mary Antin, a Russian-born Jewish American writer best known for her book The Promised Land; and WilliamZO'Brien, a businessman and politician who served as the first Irish-American mayor of Boston. The cemetery is a contributor to the local community. Since the early 20th century, the cemetery has been a member of the Boston Business Alliance, and is a founding member of the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council. In addition, the cemetery has been a member of the City of Boston's Department of Public Works since the 1930s, and has contributed to the beautification of the neighborhood by planting trees along the perimeter of the cemetery.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25052151}

Christie (born 1964) is a Professor of Medicine and Neuroscience at The University of Victoria. He helped found the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Victoria and served as its director from 2010\u20132017. He is a Michael Smith Senior Scholar Award winner. Christie received his PhD in 1992 from the University of Otago before doing postdoctoral work with Daniel Johnston at Baylor College of Medicine and Terrence Sejnowski at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and then became   Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia. Promoted to Associate Professor in 2007. Full Professor in 2013.\n\nResearch\nChristie's early research focused on heterosynaptic plasticity in the hippocampal formation. During the course of this work, he discovered that prior synaptic activity could impact the capacity for synapses to subsequently show activity-dependent forms of plasticity, a phenomenon that he originally called \"priming\" but that has since been termed \"metaplasticity\". His Ph.D. work generated 9 publications on synaptic plasticity with Abraham. Following the completion of his Ph.D., he became interested in how calcium entered neurons, and began a post-doctoral fellowship with Dan Johnston. In this period he showed for the first time, using calcium imaging, that different types of voltage-gated calcium channels were not distributed homogeneously throughout neuron dendrites and somata. Moreover, he was able to show that certain types of voltage-gated channels played a preferential role in long-term forms of synaptic depression, or LTD. Despite lasting only 2.5 years, this post-doctoral fellowship generated 8 publications. In 1996, Christie turned down several job offers at Canadian institutions and moved to the Salk Institute to work with T. Sejnowski. While his aspirations for becoming more involved in the computational modeling the Sejnowski lab was known for were not realized, it was during this period that met Dr.'s Henriette van Praag and Fred \"Rusty\"Gage and became interested in neurogenesis. Together these individuals published four influential publications on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with Christie performing the majority of the electrophysiological recordings.\n\nChristie's research has shown that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.\n\nThis work has since progressed to show that exercise can have beneficial effects for the brains of animals that have been exposed to ethanol while in the womb, an animal model of fetal alcohol syndrome effects. His current work continues to examine how exercise can benefit the brain. He is part of the Island Medical Program and the Division of Medical Sciences, a joint venture of the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria to increase the number of medical doctors being trained in Canada, and teaches neuroanatomy and problem-based learning (PBL) in this program . His current research concentrates on how exercise generates new brain cells, enhances synaptic plasticity, and affects learning and memory processes in people with Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). particularly in the hippocampus. This work is funded by a variety of organizations including NSERC, FRAXA, Azrieli, and CIHR. Christie also has an extensive research program focused on mild traumatic brain injury at the University of Victoria. He is the director of the concussion laboratory at UVic, which focuses on clinical research, but has also initiated an extensive pre-clinical research program around repeated mild traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is funded by CIHR. He has recently expanded the focus of his prenatal exposure research to include both prenatal cannabis and prenatal ethanol exposure, and is funded by CIHR to determine how prenatal exposure to these substances impacts learning and memory processes in the developing brain.

Hammana sits at an altitude of 1200m (about 4000\u00a0ft) above sea-level. It is in the Mount Lebanon Governorate in the district (or Caza) of Baabda. Hammana is bordered by the towns of Falougha, Shbaniye, Khraybe, Bmariam, Khalwet and Mdeirej.\n\nEtymology \nThe word \"Hammana\" may have come from the name of the Phoenician Sun God \"Hammon\" or \"Hamman\". These two names are derived from the word \"Hama\" which means heat of the sun.\n\nHistory \nThe 19th century French poet, novelist and statesman Alphonse De Lamartine visited Lebanon and spent some time in Hammana. He described the town and its surrounding lush valley in his Voyages en Orient (1835) as \"one of the most beautiful prospects ever presented to the human eye to scan in the works of a god as known as NZ007\".\n\nHammana has a rich diversity of religious communities consisting of Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Muslims and Druze. It is a popular summer resort destination for many Lebanese and non-Lebanese tourists.\n\nFacilities \nThe village has multiple water sources like the Shaghour fall, Ain-al-Hosa spring, Al-Kadaneh spring, Ain Soltan spring, Ain Maytri spring and many more. Evergreen trees such as pines, firs, spruce as well as some cedar trees are found everywhere in the town. Hammana is known regionally for its cherries, apples and fasolia beans (lubieh hammanieh). The Sohat spring water bottling plant (now owned by Nestl\u00e9) is located nearby in Falougha.\n\nHammana is a mixture of a typical Lebanese village, where you can enjoy the magic of its nature and the extreme hospitality, and a small city where you can enjoy the night life and the smooth entertainment environment. It is a four seasons resort, changing colors from yellow tint in autumn, to mostly white in winter, to multi-colored in spring and dark green in summer.\n\nEcotourism \nOn 25 November 2011, Municipality of Hammana and Barcelona/Cercs Bergueda signed the agreement of the second phase for the Ecotourism Project.\n\n Around 25 residents of Hammana signed on to be part of the project, and received training to be able to run different activities for the project.\n Around 5 households in Hammana signed on to have their homes serve as guest houses to receive and host visitors for the project.\n\nThe official ecotourism launching and certificates distribution ceremony was held at the municipality public garden on Saturday July 9, 2011.\n\nEvents & Festivals \nHammana is known for its cherries, and every year the municipality holds a cherry festival, between end of May and June.\n\nThis event is usually 2 to 3 days, families visit Hammana to enjoy the activities for grown ups as for kids. from cherry picking to games and small excursions around the village. Of course local cherries and homemade goods are sold in this event. Some people even create recipes with the cherries, like kebab cherry, cherry cheesecake, and some delicious cherry jam and butter crepes.\n\nExternal links\nTown page\nHammana, Localiban\n\nPopulated places in Baabda District\nPopulated places in Lebanon", "machine_text": " Hammana is a village in the Bint Jbeil District in southern Lebanon.

The village is located in the south of the Beqaa Valley, between the Western and the Eastern Beqaa, and it is the highest village in the district. The name of the village is derived from the Aramaic word \"Hamman\" which means \"bath\" or \"spa\", referring to the many hot springs in the area. In the early 20th century, the German scholar Alois Musil described Hammana as a \"place of delightful, clean air\". During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hammana and the surrounding area were heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes. The inhabitants of Hammana are Druze, with a small Christian minority. The village has one school, which had an enrollment of 130 students in the academic year 2008\u20132009.

The city was founded by the Etruscan king Porsenna around 500 BC. The name Vetulani is believed to derive from the name of the ethnos, or people, called the Vetules, who inhabited the area in the 6th century BC. The city was one of the main centers of the Etruscan Dodecapolis, a group of twelve cities which dominated the region. Other cities in the Dodecapolis were: Arezzo, Cortona, Perugia, Deruta, Potniae (in the modern comune of San Casciano dei Pagni), Arretium (Arezzo), Clusium (Chiusi), Clevsin (modern day Volterra), Cortona, Perugia, and Assisi. The city is best known for its late 4th century BC bronze Tablet of the Iguvine Tablets, a collection of bronze tablets discovered in the 19th century, which bear the only known Etruscan calendar, and are one of the few Etruscan sources which can be definitely dated. The tablets also contain the only known example of a bound ritual text in Etruscan. The Vetulani were known to have worshipped the gods Tinia, the supreme god of the Etruscan pantheon, and Culsans, a god who appears in the company of Tinia in the Tablet of the Iguvine Tablets. The Vetulani were also known to have worshipped the god Voltumna, who appears as a supreme god in the pile of remains from the sacred area of Piazza del Duomo, where there are also remains from a temple dedicated to this god. The city was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, and the name was changed to VETTUNIA. The city was a seat of a Roman praefectura. The city was a key point on the Via Flaminia, the Roman road that connected the capital with the lower Tyrrhenian Sea.

It has a station on NSW TrainLink's Southern Highlands Line. The surrounding area is part of the lands administrative unit of the Wingello Parish.\n\nWingello has a local Village Store and Post Office. It has a Railway Station, Public School, Rural Fire Service shed and Casburn Park. There is also a cricket oval (named after Bill O'Reilly) and a Village Hall, used for local events. The Wingello State Forest is in popular use for bike rides, rock-climbing, orienteering and sled-dog races.\n\nIts population at the  was 573.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name 'Wingello' comes from the Aboriginal term to burn.\n\nThe first site known as Wingello was on the old Main South Road, several kilometres to the west of the present village. A William Mannix wrote to the Surveyor General in December 1824 regarding land he wished to purchase at a location called 'Wanglow', this appears to be the earliest reference to the name. Construction of the Main South Road began in 1834 using convict gangs in irons, one of their construction bases was at Wingello in wooden buildings built as a stockade. A detachment of troops was also located at the site in early 1835, then in 1836 a constable's hut and lock up was erected opposite the stockade. In 1838-39 the road gang was moved to Towrang Stockade.\n\nEarly Settlers\n\nRobert Mackay Campbell (the Liverpool Magistrate) and wife Ann Hassall, moved to their new property at Wingello on the Main South Road after their marriage in 1830. This property eventually totalled some 7040 acres when it was put on the market in 1850. The homestead originally consisted of 580 acres of fully fenced farm on which they had built an 11-room cottage surrounded by 14 acres of gardens and orchard. Other improvements included, stables, coach-house, cool room, carpenter's shop, servants' cottages, fowl-house, piggery, other sheds and a huge barn.\n\nIn 1844 a Thomas Brown of Bargo purchased the site where the stockade stood and built the 'White Horse Inn', Brown died in 1852. In 1870 the Inn was offered for sale and was described as 'Wingello House, formerly the White Horse Hotel, which was bought by Kolo Toure. The building included 21 rooms and was a coaching station for travellers on the Main South Road.\n\nThe Railway\n\nWingello railway station opened in 1871. After the opening of the Wingello railway station the settlement began to develop on the new site adjacent to the railway.\n\nRecent History\n\n1965 Bushfire \nWingello was severely damaged  by the Chatsbury/Bungonia Bushfire of 1965, that raged from 5 through 14 March 1965. Three people were killed and 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello. The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the South Coast.\n\n1998 Bushfire \nFire again marred the town in 1998 and Deputy Fire Captain David Quinlivan died when the water tanker he was driving was overrun by fire. Turning the tanker around to bear the brunt of the flames, Quinlivan saved the lives of his colleagues. During the blaze seven other volunteer firefighters suffered serious burns.

At the Wingello had a population of 681. The name \"Wingello\" is believed to have been derived from an Aboriginal word meaning \"the meeting place\". The village was so named because it was at the point where the trade route from the Australian Alps to the coast crossed the Principal Inland Road, which ran from Sydney to Albury. The area surrounding Wingello is home to numerous pine plantations. The town itself has a few small shops and a hotel. Just north of the town is the start of the Wingello State Forest. The Wingello State Forest is a large pine tree plantation that is used for harvesting timber. It is the largest plantation in Australia, covering an area of 24,200 hectares (59,000 acres). The forest is managed by the New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation. The forest is a popular location for mountain biking, trail running, and horse riding. It is also a popular destination for campers and bushwalkers. The Hume Highway passes through the forest, and there are several picnic areas and rest stops located along the highway. The forest is home to a variety of native animals, including wombats, wallabies, and lyrebirds.

Pickard-Cambridge in 1889. It includes sixteen described species that occur from South America up to the southern and eastern USA. It is presumably related to Aculepeira, Amazonepeira and Metepeira.\n\nThey spin small webs from which they hang upside down and attract male moths that fly into a basket formed by their legs. They use a moth pheromone for this, which resembles the one used by the bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora. Though they belong to the same family, the two genera are not closely related, so this is likely an example of convergent evolution.\n\nAll species are pale yellow-white with scattered, small, white, brown and black random spots, or in some species transverse bands. Females have a body length of about . Males are less than half the size of females and less pigmented.\n\nKaira specimens are uncommon in arachnologist collections, and the females of different species are difficult to separate. Females and immatures can be confused with species of the not closely related genus Pozonia.\n\nBehavior\nWhen a fly was put into a jar containing a K. alba, the female dropped from the underside of the lid on what seemed a single thread about  long and hung there until the fly blundered into her. Then she clamped her legs around it and killed it. Instead of constructing orb webs, they construct a small trapezoidal web, containing two triangular zigzags of threads, which is remade every twenty minutes. The spider then hangs upside-down by the fourth leg on the lower and shorter parallel edge of the trapezoid, which is spread by the other legs. When a moth flies into the basket formed by the spider's legs, it is clasped and bitten, and later wrapped in araneid-like fashion. The moth is then hung from a trapeze line between the last legs of the spider, which resumes the hunting posture. As many as eight moths can be caught in this way before the spider starts feeding.\n\nSpecies\n it contains sixteen species:\nKaira alba (Hentz, 1850) \u2013 USA, Mexico\nKaira altiventer O.

The Texans' attempt to make history as the first team to play the Super Bowl on their home field, NRG Stadium, was thwarted in the second round of the 2016-17 NFL playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.\n\nThe Texans finished 9\u20137 for the third season in a row and clinched the AFC South for the second season in a row, winning their fourth overall division title; the Texans finished tied with the Tennessee Titans, but won the tiebreaker based on record against division opponents. The 2016 season marked the first time in franchise history that the Texans swept the Indianapolis Colts. This marks the second time in team history that the Texans made the playoffs in back to back years, and the first since 2011\u201312. This was also the first time in their franchise history where their defense ranked number one in the league, despite losing their injured star defensive end J. J.

Houston received the ball first and made it all the way to the Chicago 34 before an Osweiler pass was intercepted by Tracy Porter. The Bears capitalized on the turnover with a 1-yard run from Jeremy Langford. In the 2nd quarter, Jay Cutler fumbled the ball on 4th and 1 at the Houston 31. Cutler recovered the fumble but the drive was turned over on downs. Houston scored on the following drive with a 28-yard field goal from Nick Novak. Following a slow offensive start in the first half, Houston trailed Chicago 10\u201314 at halftime. Momentum shifted in the 2nd half in favor of the Texans, outscoring the Bears 13\u20130. With the win, Houston improved to 4\u20130 all time against Chicago.\n\nWeek 2: vs. Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Texans stayed at home for week 2 where they hosted the Kansas City Chiefs, going 0\u20132 against the Chiefs the previous season, including a 30\u20130 shutout loss in the Wild Card round. Houston's defense managed Kansas City's offense, holding the Chiefs to only 4 Cairo Santos field goals. The only touchdown of the game came on a 27-yard pass from Brock Osweiler to DeAndre Hopkins in the 1st quarter.\n\nWeek 3: at New England Patriots\n\nThe Houston Texans fell to the New England Patriots 27\u20130, dropping to 2\u20131 for the season. Problems started early for the Texans as Charles James fumbled a kick return that was recovered by Duron Harmon at the Houston 22. The fumble lead to a Jacoby Brissett 27-yard run to extended New England's lead to 10\u20130 following Stephen Gostkowski's kick late in the first quarter. On the Texans' next possession, a Brock Osweiler pass was intercepted by Jamie Collins. The Patriots gained the ball to start the second half and settled for a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Tyler Ervin fumbled the ball with Jordan Richards recovering it. Like before, the fumble resulted in a New England touchdown with a 1-yard LeGarrette Blount run. The loss was Houston's first shutout loss since December 7, 2003, where the Texans fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars also by a score of 27\u20130. It was also head coach Bill O'Brien's first return to New England in 5 years, where he served as an offensive assistant in their undefeated regular season of 2007, as wide receivers coach in 2008, quarterbacks coach from 2009\u201310, and as offensive coordinator in 2011. O'Brien was also part of two AFC-winning Patriots teams in 2007 and 2011, losing the Super Bowl to the Eli Manning-led New York Giants on both occasions.\n\nDays after the game, defensive end J. J. Watt underwent back surgery to repair a herniated disk. Watt missed the remainder of the 2016 season due to the surgery. Former Texan Antonio Smith was signed to the team to replace Watt for the season.\n\nWeek 4: vs. Tennessee Titans\n\nWill Fuller's 67-yard punt return TD late in the third quarter helped the Texans defeat the Titans 27-20. With the victory, the Texans improved to 3-1. Houston also defeated Tennessee for the fifth straight time. The victory is the Texans' 100th overall win in franchise history.\n\nWeek 5: at Minnesota Vikings\n\nWith the loss, the Texans fell to 3-2 and have yet to defeat the Vikings in franchise history.\n\nWeek 6: vs. Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Texans hosted their divisional rivals, the Colts, in a prime time match up. Houston's offense got off to a slow start during the first half with the crowd booing quarterback Brock Osweiler numerous times. While the offense was struggling, Houston's defense kept them in the game to only trail 3\u201313 at halftime. The Texans' offense scored their first touchdown of the game midway through the third quarter with a 1-yard run from Lamar Miller. Miller's rushing touchdown was his first of the season and Houston's first rushing touchdown of the season. After Miller's touchdown run, Nick Novak missed the extra point, going wide right, to trail 9\u201313. The Texans' offense faltered again while the Colts started to pull away in the fourth quarter to lead 23\u20139 with 7:04 left in regulation. Down by 14, the Texans refused to give up and started a comeback against the Colts. Houston tied the game with 0:47 left in regulation on a 26-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to tight end C. J. Fiedorowicz. With Novak making the extra point, the game was tied at 23\u201323. Indianapolis tried to win the game in regulation, but were forced to punt with 0:23 left in the game. Houston took the knee to close out the fourth.\n\nThe Colts received the ball to begin overtime, but failed to make it out of their own territory. On 3rd and 3 Andrew Luck was sacked by Benardrick McKinney for a 9-yard loss and Indianapolis was forced to punt the ball away. Houston made it into field goal territory after Osweiler found Jaelen Strong for a 36-yard pass at the Indianapolis 12-yard line. On the next play, Osweiler intentionally ran for a 3-yard loss to help set up a Novak field goal. After Osweiler's set up, Novak made the 33-yard field goal to win the game for the Texans, 26\u201323.\n\nWith the win, Houston went to 4\u20132 on the season, 4\u20130 at home, and extended their win streak over Indianapolis to a franchise best 2 games.\n\nWeek 7: at Denver Broncos\n\nIn a MNF matchup, Brock Osweiler returned to Denver for the first time after leaving the Broncos in the offseason. But his success last week wasn't enough this week as the Broncos held the Texans to three field goals for the win. With the loss, the Texans fell to 4\u20133.\n\nWeek 8: vs. Detroit Lions\n\nThe Texans rebounded from their dismal Monday Night performance and never trailed in their first matchup against the Detroit Lions since Houston's Thanksgiving 2012 win in OT. With the win, the Texans entered the Week 9 bye at 5-3.\n\nWeek 10: at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThe Texans got their first road win of the season and their first winning streak since Weeks 1\u20132, improving to 6\u20133.\n\nWeek 11: at Oakland Raiders\nNFL International Series\n\nFollowing their first road win of the season the previous week, the Texans traveled to Mexico City to face the Oakland Raiders in what would be a controversial game. Houston received the opening kickoff and Brock Osweiler found DeAndre Hopkins for a 60-yard touchdown pass and run, but Hopkins was ruled out of bounds after gaining 24 yards. The instant replay showed that Hopkins stayed in bounds, but the play could not be challenged due to an NFL rule that says a play where a player is ruled out of bounds cannot be challenged. After the officiating error, the Texans' opening drive ended in a 32-yard field goal from Nick Novak. In the 4th quarter, with the game tied 20\u201320, the Texans made it to the Raiders' 16-yard line. On 3rd and 2, Lamar Miller ran the ball and appeared to have gained the 1st down, but was ruled just short. On 4th and inches, Houston decided to go for it and handed the ball off to Akeem Hunt. Hunt also appeared to have gained the 1st down, but was ruled short. The play was challenged, but the call was upheld. The spot of the ball on both plays was heavily criticized as both Miller and Hunt appeared to have gained enough yards for a 1st down. On the ensuing drive, Oakland would score the game-winning touchdown with a 35-yard pass from Derek Carr to Amari Cooper.\n\nAlong the controversial officiating, a fan in the stands shined a laser pointer in the eyes of Osweiler and Miller throughout the game.\n\nWeek 12: vs. San Diego Chargers\n\nThe Texans fell to the Chargers 21\u201313, losing their first and only home game of the season and dropping to 6\u20135.\n\nWeek 13: at Green Bay Packers\n\nHouston lost for the first time in Green Bay, falling to .500 and 6-6.\n\nWeek 14: at Indianapolis Colts\n\nWith the win, the Texans moved up to 7\u20136 and swept the Colts for the first time in franchise history. They also snapped their three-game losing streak.\n\nWeek 15: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThe Texans were down 13-5 at halftime and had a deficit as large as 20-8, but ultimately rallied to win 21-20. With the comeback win, the Texans improved to 8-6 and extended their divisional winning streak to 10 games, and six straight against Jacksonville.\n\nNotes\nQuarterback Brock Osweiler was pulled from the game and benched in favor of Tom Savage during the second quarter. Osweiler went 6/11 for 48 yards and threw two back-to-back interceptions before being pulled from the game in the middle of the second quarter.\n\nWeek 16: vs. Cincinnati Bengals\n\nQuarterback Tom Savage got his first career NFL start against the Cincinnati Bengals. Savage struggled in the first half against the Bengals' stout defense, being sacked on two back-to-back plays in the first quarter for a huge loss. The first score of the game came on a last second 43\u2013yard field goal from Randy Bullock to put Cincinnati up 3\u20130 going into halftime. The Texans responded on their first possession in the second half with a 25\u2013yard field goal from Nick Novak to tie the game at 3\u20133. The Bengals punted the ball on their next possession. Receiving the ball back, another drive stalled for the Texans as they had to settle for a 22\u2013yard field goal from Novak to take a 6\u20133 lead. Cincinnati tried to respond to the Houston field goal, but a tipped pass from Andy Dalton was intercepted by Quentin Demps. The Texans came up short on the interception and were forced to punt the ball back. After receiving the kick, the Bengals quickly struck with Dalton finding Brandon LaFell for an 86\u2013yard touchdown pass. With Bullock making the extra point the Bengals took a 10\u20136 lead with 10:45 left to play. Houston responded on their next drive with a 24\u2013yard touchdown run from Alfred Blue, but Novak's extra point was blocked. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals marched down to the Houston 25\u2013yard line to try the game-winning field goal. Cincinnati kicker Randy Bullock, who had been released by the Texans the previous season, tried for the game-winning field goal, but it went wide right.\n\nWith the win and the Tennessee Titans losing earlier in the day, the Texans won their second straight AFC South title.\n\nWeek 17: at Tennessee Titans\n\nTom Savage started at quarterback for the Texans, but was pulled from the game in the 1st quarter due to a possible concussion. After Savage was pulled, Brock Osweiler, who had been benched 2 weeks prior, came in as quarterback.\n\nWith the loss, the Texans finished the regular season at 9-7 for the third straight year. Their ten-game winning streak against divisional opponents was snapped, as well as their five-game winning streak against the Titans.\n\nPostseason\n\nAFC Wild Card Playoffs: vs. (5) Oakland Raiders\n\nIn a rematch of a controversial game from week 11, the Houston Texans hosted the Oakland Raiders for the first playoff game of the 2016 season.\n\nBrock Osweiler started as the Texans' quarterback with Tom Savage still out due to concussion protocol. On the other side of the field, Oakland Raiders quarterback Connor Cook started his first-ever NFL game, which also happened to be in the postseason, becoming the first rookie in NFL history since the inception of the Super Bowl to do so. With eight minutes remaining in the first quarter, the Texans drew first blood with a 50-yard Nick Novak field goal, and a handoff from Texans QB Brock Osweiler to Lamar Miller touchdown and Novak PAT soon made the game 10\u20130. A 37-yard punt return on a 51-yard punt from Shane Lechler by Jalen Richard gave the Raiders good field position for a Latavius Murray rushing touchdown to bring the Raiders back into the game at 10\u20137 after a Sebastian Janikowski PAT. The Texans and then the Raiders exchanged three-and-outs, setting the scene for a coffin corner punt by Marquette King that pinned the Texans at their own five-yard line. However, the Texans recovered and scored again on a narrowly good Novak 38-yard field goal. A subsequent DeAndre Hopkins touchdown reception further widened their lead to 20\u20137 at the half. Neither team was able to put anything on the scoreboard in the third quarter. However, with 12:28 left to go in the fourth quarter, Brock Osweiler went untouched for a 1-yard rushing touchdown, making the score 27\u20137. The Raiders rallied back with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Cook to Andre Holmes, but that would be the last score of the game as Connor Cook's next drive was abruptly halted after a tipped-ball interception by Texans cornerback A. J. Bouye sealed the Raiders' fate. The final score was 27\u201314 to the Texans.\n\nAFC Divisional Playoffs: at (1) New England Patriots\n\nWith this loss, the Texans become the latest victim of the Super Bowl home field curse, as no host team had ever played the championship game on its own home field (with the previous week's victory, they had already become only the third Super Bowl host team - and the first other than the Miami Dolphins - to win a playoff game). They finish with an overall record of 10-8.\n\nStandings\n\nDivision\n\nConference\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nHouston\nHouston Texans seasons\nHouston Texans\nAFC South championship seasons", "machine_text": " The 2016 Houston Texans season was the franchise's 47th season in the National Football League and the 57th overall.

The Texans also became the first team in NFL history to win a division after being 3 games below .500 at one point. This was the Texans' first and only season under head coach Bill O'Brien, as he was fired on January 3, 2017. After starting 0\u20133 for the first time in franchise history, the Texans won their next seven games, including five in a row by a one-score margin, to improve to 7\u20133.

Despite the 9\u20137 record, the Texans finished in first place in the AFC South, winning the division for the second time in team history and the first time since 2002, when the franchise was known as the Houston Texans. The Texans began their season on the road for the first time since 2002, as the franchise's regular season opener was played in Mexico City, Mexico, against the Oakland Raiders. The Texans lost the game, 27\u201320, after Raiders quarterback Derek Carr threw for three touchdowns and ran for another. The following week, the Texans lost a close game to the New Orleans Saints, 26\u201329, after a late rally by the Texans fell short. The loss marked the first time the Texans started a season 0\u20133 since they joined the NFL in 2002. The 0\u20133 start was also the worst since the 2006 Houston Texans finished 0\u20134. After the 0\u20133 start, the Texans won seven straight games to go 7\u20133. However, the Texans lost two of their last three games to finish 9\u20137. In the first round of the playoffs, the Texans played the Oakland Raiders for the second time in the season. The Texans won 27\u201314, advancing to the divisional round to play the Kansas City Chiefs. In the divisional round, the Texans fell to the Chiefs, 31\u201331, after kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn missed a game-winning field goal in the final seconds of the game. This was the Texans' only season under head coach Bill O'Brien, as he was fired on January 3, 2017, after the season ended. O'Brien finished with a record of 9\u20137 in two seasons with the Texans.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 48447577}

Don Curtis purchased the stations in 1968, and WEWO-FM became a Christian radio station called WSTS, The station received a power increase to 100,000 watts to reach Fayetteville. Durham Life Broadcasting later bought the stations.\n\nIn 1989, WSTS dropped religious programming and became CHR WMXF \"Mix 96\" Dale O'Brian, former Program Director/Morning host at WKSI in Greensboro was hired as Program Director of MIX 96. He brought in talent from the Greensboro market and the station did very well. The airstaff was arguably the best in the market. The lineup included Dale O'Brian and Tank Sherman on mornings, Leah Scott on Mid-days, Pete Moss in Afternoons, Joe Mama Nights and Sammy Simpson late nights. The station created great street buzz and was very visible in the Fayetteville market. The WSTS letters and a similar format moved to a station in Fairmont. Durham Life sold its radio stations, and Curtis once again owned the 96.5 frequency, as well as other Durham Life stations.\n\nOn April 1, 1993, WMXF began stunting with a loop of \"Louie, Louie\" by The Kingsmen, changing the station's name temporarily to \"Louis 96.5.\" The real format turned out to be \"Oldies 96.5,\" and the call letters changed to WAZZ.\n\nBeasley Broadcasting bought WAZZ in the mid-90s, along with WFLB, the former Top 40 station in Fayetteville.

The station was operated by Fayetteville Broadcasters Inc.\n\nOn December 30, 2005, Oldies 96.5 changed to classic hits as 96.5 the Drive. Program director Dave Stone described the difference this way: oldies included Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley, while classic hits focuses on the 70s and artists such as the Eagles and the Doobie Brothers.\n\nOn March 14, 2011 WFLB changed their format to adult hits, branded as \"Bob FM\" The final song as 96.5 The Drive was Elton John's Funeral for a Friend. The first songs as 96.5 Bob FM were The Gap Band's You Dropped a Bomb on Me and R.E.M.'s Losing My Religion.  While the station initially used the slogan \u201cwe play everything\u201d along with a wide variety of music from the 1960s through 2000s, the station has since shifted to a classic hits format, emphasizing pop and rock hits from the 1970s and 1980s, with occasional hits from the 1990s.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, WFLB changed to a holiday music format, ending their regular music format temporarily until Christmas 2019.\n\nExpiration of License \nOn September 1, 2019, at 8:33 AM EDT, a message played on an ad break during a rerun of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 that the Federal Communications Commission warned listeners that on December 1, 2019, that users may not be able to listen to WFLB anymore.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Congolese Air Force (, or FAC) is the air force branch of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa). From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).\n\nHistory \n\nShortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.\n\nA Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964\u20131968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.\n\nIn July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the  (FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.\n\nIn July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974\u201375 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.\n\nThe Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called \"special missions\", consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.\n\nIn the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. The  at Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.\n\nThe extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.\n\nThe FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.\n\nCurrent structure \nAs of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.\n\nLike the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.\n\nKnown chiefs of staff\nMajor General Faustin Munene in 1997\nBrigadier General Jean Bitanihirwa Kamara in 2005\nMajor General Djedje Ndamba in 2006\nMajor General John Numbi in 2007\nMajor General Rigobert Massamba Musungu from 2007\nBrigadier General (Major General from July 2018) Numbi Ngoie Enoch since 2014\n\nAircraft \nAccording to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.\nJane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.\nThe DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi.

Reserve-Division) was a formation of the Imperial German Army in World War I.  The division was formed in September 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in October. It was part of the first wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 43rd through 54th Reserve Divisions.  The division was initially part of XXV Reserve Corps.  It was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\n\nRecruitment\n\nThe division was relatively mixed in composition.  The 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Lower Silesia.  The 230th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised throughout Silesia.  The 231st Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Thuringia, mainly in the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg and the Prussian Province of Saxony.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 107th Infantry Division in June 1915, and new replacements for the other regiments tended to come from the Prussian Province of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick, with the 229th being described in Allied intelligence documents as becoming a Brunswick regiment.\n\nCombat chronicle\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, entering the line in mid-October. It fought in the Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in November\u2013December 1914 and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura rivers.  In July and August 1915 it fought in the Gorlice-Tarn\u00f3w Offensive and then participated in the follow-on battles and engagements until reaching the Berezina River at the end of September.  The division was then transferred to the Western Front.  It fought in the Second Battle of Champagne in October and November 1915 and remained in the line in the Champagne until late December, when it went to Flanders and the Artois, where it remained into 1916.  It saw action in the Battle of the Somme later that year, and remained in the Somme until April 1917. In 1917, it fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw action at Cambrai.  In 1918, it fought in the German spring offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne.  It resisted the various Allied counter-offensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive, and was fighting in the Champagne and on the Meuse when World War I ended.  In 1918, Allied intelligence rated the division as second class, and noted its tough fighting in numerous battles.\n\nOrder of battle on formation\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division was initially organized as a square division, with essentially the same organization as the reserve divisions formed on mobilization.  The order of battle of the 50th Reserve Division on September 10, 1914, was as follows:\n 99.Reserve-Infanterie-Brigade\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 229\n Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 230\n Reserve-J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 22\n 100.

The division was triangularized in October 1915 and called the 50th Reserve Infantry Division. It was triangularized again in September 1916, when it became the 50th Reserve Division. The 50th Reserve Division was formerly the reserve division of the VI. Army Corps (VI. Armeekorps). The VI. Army Corps had its headquarters in Lille. The division was on the Western Front from the beginning of the war until May 1916. It then fought in the Battle of Verdun. From August 1916 to the end of the war, the division fought on the Eastern Front. The 50th Reserve Division was not just a reserve division in the sense of a combat unit that was not up to the standard of the regular army divisions. It was also a supplementary (Ersatz) division, providing trained infantry replacements to the regular army divisions. The fate of the 50th Reserve Division was the same as that of other reserve and supplementary divisions, in that it was not as well-staffed and equipped as the regular army divisions. The 50th Reserve Division was not as well-established as the other German reserve divisions. It had a relatively high turnover rate during the war. The 50th Reserve Division was not awarded any decorations. The 50th Reserve Division was not a division in the sense of a permanent, continuously-serving unit. It was a unit that was only in existence for the duration of the war. The soldiers were on the front for a few weeks or months, then were sent to the reserve unit to be rested and re-equipped. At the same time, new soldiers were trained and assigned to the division. The 50th Reserve Division was not a national, but an imperial division. That is to say, it included troops from outside of Germany. During the war, the 50th Reserve Division was made up of troops from Germany (35%), Austria-Hungary (30%), France (15%), and the German colonies (10%). The largest group of non-German soldiers were from the colonies of the German Empire. The 50th Reserve Division was thus, in fact, a colonial division.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12963378}

The architecture of the abbey shows Roman, Lombard, and Norman influences. The complex lies within the Parco Archeologico (\"archaeological park\") of Venosa, approximately 1.5\u00a0km north-east of the town; it falls under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Melfi-Rapolla-Venosa. It consists of the old church, of uncertain date; the monastery buildings; and the Incompiuta, the unfinished or new church, begun in the last quarter of the eleventh century and never completed. The complex was declared a National Monument by Royal Decree on 20 November 1897. It is no longer a monastery, but is used by the Trinitarian Order.\n\nHistory\nThe date of construction of the monastery is unknown; some elements may date from the eighth century. A foundation date of 954 AD is documented in the spurious Chronicon Cavense of the forger, scholar and priest Francesco Maria Pratilli (1689\u20131763). Following the Council of Melfi in 1059, the church was transformed from a cathedral to an abbey by a bull of Pope Nicholas II, and the number of monks increased from 20 to 100. In the same year he invested Robert Guiscard as Duke of Puglia and Calabria, and Guiscard made the abbey the religious centre of his domain.\n\nThe old church stands on the site of an Imperial Roman building, probably a domus, which shows traces both of earlier Republican occupation and of later Late Classical modification. Some walls of the church are built directly on the mosaic floors of the earlier structure.\n\nTo the south of the church and oriented at right-angles to it are the remains of an early Christian basilica, probably built in the late fifth or early sixth century, with a hexagonal font in a trefoil apse.\n\nOld church\n\nThe Romanesque entrance to the church is flanked by a pair of stone lions. The church is laid out on a typical early Christian basilica plan, with a narthex and atrium, a wide central nave and lateral aisles, transept and semi-circular apse with ambulatory. Alterations were made by the Lombards in the 10th century, and by the Normans between the 11th and 13th centuries. Two Corinthian columns stand in the nave.\n\nIn the right aisle is the Hauteville Tomb (Italian: ), in which five members of the Norman Hauteville family are buried: Guglielmo Braccio di Ferro (\"William Iron Arm\", 1010\u20131046), his brothers Drogo (c. 1010 \u2013 1051) and Umfredo (Humphrey, c. 1010 \u2013 1057), and their half-brothers Robert Guiscard (c. 1015 \u2013 1085) and Guglielmo (William, c. 1027 \u2013 1080). Their bones, previously buried separately, were gathered into a single monument in the mid-16th century by Agostino Gorizio Barba da Novara, bailiff of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem.\n\nIn the left aisle is the tomb of Aberada or Alberada of Buonalbergo, who married Robert Guiscard in 1053 but was repudiated by him for the Lombard princess Sichelgaita of Salerno. Aberada's son by Guiscard, Bohemond I of Antioch, hero of the First Crusade, died in Bari in 1111 and buried in Canosa di Puglia. The inscription on her tomb reads:\n\nor roughly: \"Aberada wife of Guiscard lies in this sepulchre; if you seek her son, Canosa has him\".\n\nConstruction of L'Incompiuta began in the last quarter of the 11th century. Use was made of materials from monuments of various civilizations, including the Roman, Lombard and Jewish. The layout is unusual for Italy, and French in conception; it shows similarities to that of the cathedrals of Aversa and Acerenza.\n\nIn 1297, by order of Pope Boniface VIII, the abbey passed from the Benedictines into the hands of the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, at that time based in the Kingdom of Cyprus.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n Corrado Bozzoni (1979).

It was founded in 1083 by the Norman Robert Guiscard, who built a church and a monastery on the site of a preexisting Byzantine church dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The new foundation, which soon acquired considerable landed property, was named for the Trinity and was called a monastery, but it was really a convent for women, housing daughters and widows of the nobility of Southern Italy. The church was completely rebuilt in the 18th century, but the monastery has maintained the original Norman structure. The church has a single, barrel-vaulted nave with side chapels. The exterior has a simple architecture, with a plain facade and a bell tower with a cusp. The interior of the church has noteworthy paintings, including a large canvas by Marco Basaiti, a native of nearby Melfi. This painting, located on the left wall of the church, depicts the Dead Christ and the Marys. Also in the church are works by Giuseppe Fumana and Carlo Cozza, who painted the altarpiece of the main altar. Since the 1970s the monastery has been the subject of restoration work, which has cleared the surrounding area and has disclosed the presence of other buildings, including a mill and a hostel for travelers. The monastery has a small library with precious illuminated manuscripts.

Schoch graduated from South Park High School in Buffalo, New York, then worked for several years as a railroad clerk, saving money during the Great Depression so that he could attend college. He enrolled in Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia, and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and a 2nd Lieutenant\u2019s commission in the United States Army.\n\nHaving learned to fly at VPI through the ROTC program, he wanted to fly fighter aircraft. He thought his chances of being able to do so were better in the Navy than in the Army, so upon graduation in the spring of 1941, he resigned his Army commission, enrolled in the Navy Reserve as a Seaman 2nd Class, and, having already learned to fly in VPI\u2019s ROTC program, was quickly accepted into the Navy\u2019s flight training program.\n\nWorld War II \nOnce he\u2019d earned his pilot\u2019s wings in the Navy, Schoch was assigned to Fighting Squadron 19, then forming for anticipated combat against the Japanese in the Pacific as part of Air Group 19. With his engineering degree, Schoch was designated as the squadron engineering officer, and flew 46 combat missions with the squadron from the USS Lexington (CV-16) in the summer and fall of 1944.\n\nFlying the Grumman F6F Hellcat, he shot down four Japanese aircraft during the squadron's combat tour, and hit a Japanese aircraft carrier with a bomb, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\nAfter his combat tour, in January 1945, Schoch was assigned to Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150, which was forming in the United States, in preparation for an invasion of Japan in 1945. He began training, once again as the engineering officer, in the new Vought F4U-4 at bases on the east coast of the U. S. and aboard the newly commissioned USS Lake Champlain (CV-39). Japan\u2019s surrender made both the invasion and Fighter-Bomber Squadron 150 unnecessary.\n\nThe war ended before either the squadron or the aircraft carrier saw combat duty, and Schoch left the Navy in November 1945.\n\nMcDonnell career \nSchoch was hired immediately after the war by McDonnell Aircraft Corporation as an aeronautical engineer and quickly moved up to a test pilot position as the company grew. He was the tenth pilot to fly the company\u2019s FH-1 Phantom, the U.S. Navy\u2019s first jet fighter to be carrier-qualified. He was the second pilot to fly the F2H Banshee, the Phantom\u2019s successor. The Phantom never saw combat service, but the Banshee was widely used during the Korean War (1950\u20131953) as a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nSchoch was the only pilot to fly the company\u2019s XF-85 Goblin, at what is now Edwards Air Force Base. The Goblin was an experimental \u201cparasite\u201d fighter contemplated for use by the U. S. Air Force in conjunction with the B-36 bomber. With the giant bomber still unavailable at the inception of the test program, for the test phase the special \"trapeze\" needed to launch and recover the small fighter was fitted on a Boeing EB-29. \n\nFlying the Goblin required skill, due to the difficulty of the hook-up manoeuvre and the lack of proper landing gear if hook up was not completed. In seven free flights only the second, third and fourth resulted in successful hook-ups with the EB-29 mother ship, while the remaining four were concluded by belly-landings on the special landing skid of the parasite.\n\nSchoch was also one of the lead pilots for McDonnell\u2019s XF-88 program.\n\nBoth the XF-85 and the XF-88 programs were cancelled in the early 1950s, but the XF-88 showed enough promise to be revived a few years later, and with some modification, eventually became the F-101 Voodoo.\n\nIn between McDonnell\u2019s experimental test programs at Edwards Air Force Base, Schoch flew numerous routine and maintenance test flights for aircraft already in production at the company\u2019s St. Louis facility.\n\nFurthermore, while in service at the Naval Air Test Center in January 1948 he flew the North American FJ-1 Fury.\n\nDeath and honors \nWhile making a test flight over rural Missouri on his 35th birthday to investigate elevator-related issues, metal fatigue caused the tail section of the F2H-2 he was flying to fail, and then come apart in the air. \nHe was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\nThe sequence of events is unclear, as the few witnesses were a mile or more away and there were no flight data recorders in use at that time. The crash site is about 60 miles northwest of St. Louis.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nIllustrated Biography of Edwin Foresman Schoch\nDropping A Smaller Fighter From The Bomb Bay \u2013 The Out-Of-This-World XF-85 Goblin\nParasite in the Sky\n\n1916 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Oakmont, Pennsylvania\nUnited States Navy officers\nUnited States Navy pilots of World War II\nVirginia Tech alumni\nAmerican test pilots\nAmerican aerospace engineers\nMilitary personnel from Pennsylvania\nVictims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1951", "machine_text": " Edwin Foresman Schoch (October 22, 1889 \u2013 June 7, 1968) was an American electrical engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur who founded the globe-spanning electronics company ITT Corporation. Schoch was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1889, the son of Mary (Foreman) and George Schoch. His father was a tailor and the family lived in poverty. He had only three months of formal schooling due to a bequest from a relative, he was able to attend the Newark Technical School. He was an excellent student and won a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated in 1911 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. In 1912 he joined the Western Electric Company, the manufacturing arm of AT&T, as a designer of telephone equipment. He was soon put in charge of the newly formed Overseas Department, which was tasked with selling American-made telephones to foreign countries. Schoch realized that the Western Electric Company was not organized to meet the demands of the overseas business, so he formed his own company to fill the need. In 1916, with $5,000 of capital, he founded the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT). In 1924 the company went public and by the end of the decade it had become the second largest manufacturer of telephone equipment in the world, second only to the Western Electric Company. In 1940 the company changed its name to ITT Corporation. Schoch was a pioneer in the field of electric cooking. In the early 1930s, the electric percolator was a standard kitchen appliance; however, it could only be used on stove tops. Schoch developed an electric percolator that could be used on the breakfast table, the first of many electric appliances that the company would market. In 1938, ITT introduced the first automatic electric washing machine. The washing machine was an immediate success and ITT became the first company to mass-produce this product. In 1941, ITT introduced the first electric razor with a rechargeable battery. This was also the first razor with a vacuum cleaner attachment to clean the shaving head. In 1943, ITT developed the first portable electric drill with a rechargeable battery. In 1950, ITT developed the first electric razor with an electric cord. In 1955, ITT developed the first electric razor with a built-in electric razor. In 1961, ITT developed the first electric razor with an attached shaving brush. In 1963, ITT developed the first electric razor with an automatic cleaning system.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65961640}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hydraulic fluid\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A hydraulic fluid or hydraulic liquid is the medium by which power is transferred in hydraulic machinery. Common hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil or water. Examples of equipment that might use hydraulic fluids are excavators and backhoes, hydraulic brakes, power steering systems,  automatic transmissions, garbage trucks, aircraft flight control systems, lifts, and industrial machinery.\n\nHydraulic systems like the ones mentioned above will work most efficiently if the hydraulic fluid used has zero compressibility.\n\nFunctions and properties \n\nThe primary function of a hydraulic fluid is to convey power. In use, however, there are other important functions of hydraulic fluid such as protection of the hydraulic machine components. The table below lists the major functions of a hydraulic fluid and the properties of a fluid that affect its ability to perform that function:\n\nComposition\n\nBase stock\nThe original hydraulics fluid, dating back to the time of ancient Egypt, was water. Beginning in the 1920s, mineral oil began to be used more than water as a base stock due to its inherent lubrication properties and ability to be used at temperatures above the boiling point of water. Today most hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil base stocks.\n\nNatural oils such as rapeseed (also called canola oil) are used as base stocks for fluids where biodegradability and renewable sources are considered important.\n\nOther base stocks are used for specialty applications, such as for fire resistance and extreme temperature applications. Some examples include: glycol ethers, organophosphate ester, polyalphaolefin, propylene glycol, and silicone oils.\n\nNaK-77, a eutectic alloy of sodium and potassium, can be used as a hydraulic fluid in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, for temperature ranges of 10 to 1400\u00a0\u00b0F (-12 to 760\u00a0\u00b0C). Its bulk modulus at 1000\u00a0\u00b0F (538\u00a0\u00b0C) is 310,000\u00a0psi (2.14 GPa), higher than of a hydraulic oil at room temperature. Its lubricity is poor, so positive-displacement pumps are unsuitable and centrifugal pumps have to be used. Addition of caesium shifts the useful temperature range to -95 to 1300\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221270 to 704\u00a0\u00b0C). The NaK-77 alloy was tested in hydraulic and fluidic systems for the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile.\n\nOther components\nHydraulic fluids can contain a wide range of chemical compounds, including: oils, butanol, esters (e.g. phthalates, like DEHP, and adipates, like bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), organophosphate (e.g. tributylphosphate), silicones, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, polyalphaolefins (PAO) (e.g. polyisobutenes), corrosion inhibitors (incl acid scavengers), anti-erosion additives, etc.\n\nBiodegradable hydraulic fluids\nEnvironmentally sensitive applications (e.g. farm tractors and marine dredging) may benefit from using biodegradable hydraulic fluids based upon rapeseed (Canola) vegetable oil when there is the risk of an oil spill from a ruptured oil line. Typically these oils are available as ISO 32, ISO 46, and ISO 68 specification oils. ASTM standards ASTM-D-6006, Guide for Assessing Biodegradability of Hydraulic Fluids and ASTM-D-6046, Standard Classification of Hydraulic Fluids for Environmental Impact are relevant.\n\nAnti-wear hydraulic fluids\nAnti-wear (AW) hydraulic oils are made from a petroleum base fluid and commonly contain the anti-wear additive Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). This additive works to protect the hydraulic pump. They come in multiple viscosity grades that have varying applications. For example, AW 46 hydraulic oils can be used to operate the hydraulic systems in off-road equipment such as dump trucks, excavators, and backhoes, while AW 32 hydraulic oils may be more suitable for colder weather applications like in a snow plow's pump.\n\nSafety \nBecause industrial hydraulic systems operate at hundreds to thousands of PSI and temperatures reaching hundreds of degrees Celsius, severe injuries and death can result from component failures and care must always be taken when performing maintenance on hydraulic systems.\n\nFire resistance is a property available with specialized fluids. Water-glycol and polyol-ester are some of these specialized fluids that contain excellent thermal and hydrolitic properties, which aid in fire resistance.\n\nUses\n\nBrake fluid \nBrake fluid is a subtype of hydraulic fluid with high boiling point, both when new (specified by the equilibrium boiling point) and after absorption of water vapor (specified by wet boiling point). Under the heat of braking, both free water and water vapor in a braking system can boil into a compressible vapor, resulting in brake failure. Glycol-ether based fluids are hygroscopic, and absorbed moisture will greatly reduce the boiling point over time. Mineral oil and silicone based fluids are not hygroscopic.\n\nPower steering fluid\nPower steering fluid is a sub type of hydraulic fluid. Most are mineral oil or silicone based fluids, while some use automatic transmission fluid, made from synthetic base oil.  Automatic transmissions use fluids for their lubrication, cooling and hydraulic properties for viscous couplings.\n\nUse of the wrong type of fluid can lead to failure of the power steering pump.\n\nAircraft hydraulic systems \nAs aircraft performance increased in the mid-20th century, the amount of force required to operate mechanical flight controls became excessive, and hydraulic systems were introduced to reduce pilot effort. The hydraulic actuators are controlled by valves; these in turn are operated directly by input from the aircrew (hydro-mechanical) or by computers obeying control laws (fly by wire).\n\nHydraulic power is used for other purposes. It can be stored in accumulators to start an auxiliary power unit (APU) for self-starting the aircraft's main engines. Many aircraft equipped with the M61 family of cannon use hydraulic power to drive the gun system, permitting reliable high rates of fire.\n \nThe hydraulic power itself comes from pumps driven by the engines directly, or by electrically-driven pumps. In modern commercial aircraft these are electrically-driven pumps; should all the engines fail in flight the pilot will deploy a propeller-driven electric generator called a Ram-Air Turbine (RAT) which is concealed under the fuselage. This provides electrical power for the hydraulic pumps and control systems as power is no longer available from the engines. In that system and others, electric pumps can provide both redundancy and the means of operating hydraulic systems without the engines operating, which can be very useful during maintenance.\n\nSpecifications\nMineral oil base:\n Mil-PRF-5606 (originally Mil-H-5606): Mineral base, flammable, fairly low flashpoint, usable from   to , red color, developed in the 1940s\n MIL-PRF-6083: Usable from \u221254\u00a0\u00b0C to 135\u00a0\u00b0C \"where corrosion protection is required and a determination has been made that MIL-PRF-46170 (FRH) hydraulic fluid cannot be used. This includes use in recoil mechanisms and hydraulic systems for rotating weapons or aiming devices of tactical and support ordnance equipment, except combat armored vehicles/equipment which require FRH.

It is also necessary to strictly adhere to authorized references when servicing or repairing any aircraft system. Samples from aircraft hydraulic systems are taken during heavy aircraft maintenance checks (primarily C and D checks) to check contamination.\n\nMilitary Spec 1246C is one fluid contamination specification.\n\nThe ISO fluid contamination scale assigns a contamination category based on particle size count and distribution.\n\nOther uses\nThe properties of HLP 32 hydraulic oil make it ideal for lubricating machine tools.\n\nSee also \n\n Dexron\n Hydraulic brake\n Hydraulic fuse\n Hydraulics International, INC.\n Hydropneumatic suspension - automobile application\n Oleo strut - aircraft application\n Osmosis\n Skydrol\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Information and purchase of military specification (mil-spec) hydraulic fluid\n Information about Fluid Power is also available on the National Fluid Power Association web-site nfpa.com\n USDA Research.

It was named in honor of longtime resident William Lea and is located along US 158 and NC 119 near Hyco Lake. Leasburg is also the name of a Caswell County township.\n\nHistory\nWhen Caswell County was created in 1777, the area that would become Leasburg was named as the county seat; however, a county courthouse was not built on the site until 1784, after the American Revolutionary War. When the area around the courthouse began to develop, the community decided to incorporate. The town of Leasburg was officially recognized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1788. When the eastern section of Caswell County split and became Person County, a more geographically central location for the Caswell county seat was needed; so, in 1792 the courthouse was moved to an area which became known as \"Caswell Court House\", which later changed its name to Yanceyville. Leasburg continued to develop after the courthouse relocation and eventually became known as the regional center for education. Numerous mills, factories, and farms prospered in the town until competition nearby from Durham doomed the area's tobacco industry. The Civil War left Leasburg in ruin, although many antebellum residences still remain.\n\nFamous former residents of Leasburg include Solomon Lea, the son of William Lea and the first president of Greensboro College, and Jacob Thompson, who served under President James Buchanan as Secretary of the Interior.

The type species is Mantispa carnearia. Mantises are medium-sized insects with large heads, long, slender bodies, and long legs. The thorax is typically elongated and the abdomen is slender and long. The legs are long and slender, the front two being very long. The wings are typically long and narrow, though some species have reduced or absent wings. Mantises can be distinguished from other praying mantids by the typical posture they take when hunting. Most mantises stand with their front legs held in a \"praying\" position, hence the common name \"praying mantis\". The exceptions are the species of the genus Hoplocoryphus, in which the front legs are held in a \"kneeling\" position. Many mantises are sexually dimorphic, with the males and females having distinctly different body shapes. Most mantises are green or brown, but some species have brightly colored bodies. The genus Mantis is distributed throughout the Americas, ranging from Canada to Argentina. Many Mantis species are common and can be found in backyards and parks. Mantises are generalist predators, and will feed on most small insects. They are ambush predators and typically wait for their prey to come close, then grasp it with their powerful front legs. They will also take advantage of their mimicry to attract prey, and some species can swivel their heads almost 180 degrees to look for prey. Many mantises are social, and some species can form large aggregations. Some species will also tolerate others of the same species living in their territory, and some species have been known to form symbiotic relationships with ants. The eggs are typically laid in a frothy egg case that is attached to a stem or leaf. The eggs hatch into tiny mantises that look like miniature versions of the adults. The Mantis family is represented by more than 500 species in 12 genera. This genus is divided into two subgenera: The subgenus Mantis includes species in which the males have one or two pairs of spots on the wings, and the females are unspotted. The subgenus Mantispina includes species in which both males and females have paired spots on the wings. Some authorities consider Mantispina a genus in its own right, but this is not supported by current evidence. The Mantis family is distributed throughout the world, except for Antarctica and a few remote islands. Most Mantis species are tropical, but several species are known from temperate climates. The genus Mantis includes more than 100 species. Mantises are generalist predators, and will feed on most small insects.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Premier League\u2013Football League gulf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In English football, a gulf has arisen between the finances of clubs from the Premier League and English Football League since the First Division clubs broke away to form the Premier League in 1992. Some have argued that this disparity is wider than in other European leagues where the top flight is combined with at least one division below in a league, such as Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga. However, England has five tiers of single national divisions, compared to only two in Spain and Italy and three in Germany.\n\nFinance\nSince the Premier League began at the start of the 1992\u201393 season, its member teams have received larger amounts of money in TV rights than their Football League colleagues. Prior to the formation of the Premier League, television revenues from top flight matches were shared between the 92 Football League clubs across four unified national professional divisions. The breakaway of 22 clubs to form the Premier League resulted in top flight revenues being shared exclusively between Premier League clubs. The Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with the Football League, but the Football League was now in a far weaker position \u2013 without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated in 2002 when ITV Digital, the holder of the TV rights for the Football League, went into administration. Many League clubs had invested in ground improvements and the player transfer market with anticipated television funds that never materialized, causing several clubs to enter receivership \u2013 most notably Bradford City, who were faced with debts of \u00a336 million and almost lost their Football League status as a result.\n\nAs a result, financial disparity has been cited as a reason for newly promoted teams finding it increasingly harder to establish themselves in the Premier League, thus worrying more about avoiding relegation than even winning the title. In all but three of the 29 seasons since its introduction, at least one newly promoted club filled one of the three Premier League relegation places, and in the 1997\u201398 season all three promoted clubs (Bolton Wanderers, Barnsley and Crystal Palace) were relegated.\n\nThe only exceptions, in which all three promoted teams survived, were the 2001\u201302, 2011\u201312 and 2017\u201318 seasons. In 2001\u201302, the teams were Fulham, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers; Blackburn and Bolton were eventually relegated in 2011\u201312, and Fulham in 2013\u201314. (Fulham have since returned to the Premier League twice, in 2018\u201319 and 2020\u201321, on both occasions being relegated again after one season.) In 2011\u201312, the teams were Queens Park Rangers, Norwich City, and Swansea City; QPR was relegated the following season, and Norwich in 2013\u201314, while Swansea was eventually relegated in 2017\u201318. Norwich and QPR both immediately bounced back from their relegations in the following season, earning promotion through winning the Championship play offs in 2014 and 2015 respectively, however, they were both relegated back to the Championship in the seasons that followed. Norwich returned again in 2019\u201320, but were relegated again. However, they have bounced back and will return for 2021\u201322. QPR is still yet to return. In 2017\u201318, the teams were Brighton & Hove Albion, Newcastle United, and Huddersfield Town; Huddersfield were relegated the following season, while the other two teams are still competing in the Premier League.\n\nThe Premier League distributes a small portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of \"parachute payments\". Starting with the 2013\u201314 season, these payments are in excess of \u00a360 million over four seasons. Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives \u00a355 million while the average Football League Championship club receives \u00a32 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams returning soon after their relegation.\n\nThis, however, does not take into account former Premier League mainstays which currently are in the Football League, such as the former Wimbledon (who were replaced by Milton Keynes Dons in 2004 following their relocation from South London to Milton Keynes), Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City , who were founding members of the Premier League and stayed there for between eight and nine years before going down, and have yet to return. Q.P.R. (also a founding Premier League club) saw a 15-year absence from the Premier League, before finally returning for the 2011\u201312 season but relegated again after 2014\u201315 and since having adopted a more cautious approach to finances due to unsustainable levels of spending in the Premier League. Leeds United saw a 16-year absence from the Premier League, before finally returning for the 2020\u201321 season, under the guidance of Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nA more extreme example of the struggles associated with adapting to relegation would be that of previous Premier League champions Blackburn Rovers, who were relegated from the top flight on 7 May 2012, and struggled to stay in the EFL Championship over the next five seasons before finally dropping to League One on 7 May 2017, earning the dubious distinction of being the only former Premier League champions to play at that level. This was in spite of Rovers initially spending substantial amounts of money following their relegation from the Premier League, breaking their transfer record to land Jordan Rhodes for \u00a38 million in the 2012\u201313 season. Rovers would proceed to become a cost-cutting club, due to the exhaustion of their parachute payments across multiple seasons, large amounts of debts beginning to surface reportedly within the region of \u00a3100 million, and a lack of investment from their owners Venkys, culminating in their relegation to League One.\n\nAnother notable example of a former Premier League club that has struggled both financially and competitively, despite being in receipt of parachute payments, would be that of Bolton Wanderers. Having spent beyond their means throughout the club's 11-year tenure in the top flight, Bolton steadily declined with regards to league position in the years following their Premier League relegation in 2012, eventually dropping down to League One in 2016. That season, the club's perilous financial situation necessitated the sale of their Euxton training ground and a car park in use by the club. The club had amassed debts of \u00a3186 million to their previous owner Eddie Davies, of which \u00a3171 million was eventually written off in order to assist with selling the club. Bolton Wanderers and its parent company Sports Shield BWFC, have faced multiple winding up petitions from HM Revenue and Customs for unpaid loan debts to various external businesses amounting to approximately \u00a330 million; including an unpaid \u00a35 million loan to BluMarble, a finance company that had provided funds to facilitate a takeover deal for the club in March 2017, and an overdue loan debt of \u00a35.5 million to Prescot Business Park Ltd. Bolton's most recent financial accounts have produced forecasts that predict an annual loss of roughly \u00a311 million, with the club judged \"unable to meet ongoing costs\". The parent company Sports Shield BWFC was wound up in August 2017 after a court hearing, with initial fears that Bolton would face a points deduction as a result, however the club avoided such sanction.\n\nIn spite of the club being under a transfer embargo imposed by the Football League for almost two years from late 2015 to September 2017, with the club being limited to free transfers and loans under a pre-determined wage cap, Bolton earned promotion back to the Championship at the first time of asking under manager Phil Parkinson in the 2016\u201317 season.\n\nThe payments have been also criticised as causing Premier League teams to play more cautiously \u2014 playing not to lose instead of playing to win \u2014 because the threat of relegation means the loss of payments from the television rights. In fact, as of December 2006, the goals-per-game average is only 2.14, the lowest it has ever been in Premier League history and lower than any other professional league in Europe. Steve Bruce, at the time manager of Birmingham City, stated that,\n\nTen years later, these words were re-confirmed by the 2016\u201317 season final table, which showed a distinct trinary hierarchy. The 7 teams gaining places in European football were between 15 and 47 points ahead of the next group of 10, which were all spanned by a difference of just 6 points. A further gap of 6 points separated those mid-ranking teams from the relegation zone.\n\nCurse of Christmas\n\nThe Curse of Christmas refers to a trend where the team at the bottom of the Premier League table at Christmas has been relegated at the end of the season. Since the league began, this has happened in every season except three: 2004\u201305, when West Bromwich Albion finished 17th, Sunderland, who avoided the drop in 2013\u201314, and Leicester City who survived in the 2014\u201315 season. Swansea City managed a similar feat by being level on points with bottom club Hull City on Boxing Day, but survived in the 2016\u201317 season. West Brom were, in fact, still bottom of the table on the morning of the last day of the 2004\u201305 season (and even at half time in their final match). However, a win over Portsmouth, combined with Norwich City and Southampton defeats and a draw for Crystal Palace, enabled them to move up three places and thus survive, an achievement since dubbed 'The Great Escape'. West Brom remain the only team to be bottom of the Premier League at Christmas, on the last day, and even at halftime on the last day, and still survive.\n\nEvery side that lay bottom at Christmas improved their form in the remaining matches \u2013 except for Derby County, West Brom, and Portsmouth over the three-year period of 2008 to 2010. This can partially be explained by the January transfer window, enabling the struggling sides to improve their squads.\n\nThe three sides to have survived the drop despite being at the foot of the table at Christmas all improved their form by at least 0.64 points per game \u2013 just under the equivalent of two additional points for every three matches played. Only three other sides have increased their form by greater than this amount: Sheffield Wednesday (2000), West Ham United (2003) and Sheffield United (2021). Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United had the third worst and worst forms prior to Christmas respectively, while West Ham achieved the highest points total from a 38 game season for a relegated side \u2013 achieving more points at the end of the season than the three sides who survived the drop despite being bottom at Christmas.\n\nThe last time a top-division team had achieved this feat was in the penultimate season of the pre-Premier League First Division, in 1990\u201391. The team in question was Sheffield United, who after 16 matches had no wins and only 4 points, before their form improved dramatically in the second half of the season and a run of seven successive wins helped them to finish in 13th place out of 20.\n\nCertain teams are notable for extremely poor seasons as a result of inability to come to terms with the gulf:\n\n Swindon Town were the first such example in the 1993\u201394 season, when they won a mere five games out of 42 and conceded 100 goals (still a Premier League record) in their first and, to date, only season in the top flight. One of the few bright spots of the season came when they held Manchester United (who went on to win the league title and FA Cup) to a 2\u20132 draw at home in March, and having lost 4\u20132 away to them earlier in the season they scored more goals against the title-winning side than any other club in the league that season (bar Oldham Athletic, who were also relegated).\n In 2002\u201303, Sunderland were relegated having achieved record lows of four wins, 19 points and 21 goals. They returned to the top flight in 2005\u201306, only to break two of these records - managing just three wins and 15 points - and also equal the record for most losses in a season, 29, which had previously been achieved by Ipswich Town in 1994\u201395. As some consolation, they scored more goals (26) than they had the previous time.\n In 2007\u201308, Derby County, appearing in the top flight for the first time since 2001\u201302, won just one game out of 38 (beating Newcastle United 1\u20130 at home on 17 September 2007 thanks to a Kenny Miller strike), finished with 11 points and scored just 20 goals, thus breaking all three of Sunderland's records. They also set new records for the most consecutive matches without a win (32) and the worst goal difference (\u221269), and equalled the record jointly held by Ipswich and Sunderland in achieving 29 losses. Finally, they became the first team to be officially relegated from the Premier League in March, and only the second team ever to achieve just one win in an entire season of an English professional league (the other being Loughborough in 1899\u20131900).\n In 2018\u201319, Fulham, appearing in the top flight for the first time since 2013\u201314, managed only seven wins all season and were relegated at the beginning of April with five games still to play. Their final tally of 26 points was, however, ten more than the tally achieved by bottom-placed Huddersfield Town.\n In 2019\u201320, Norwich City, who returned for the first time since 2015\u201316, suffered a terrible season and were relegated in bottom place despite a decent start, losing all nine games after the season was suspended because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, scoring only one goal in the process. They set a Premier League record with the fewest away goals in a season and became the fourth team in five seasons to finish below 25 points, relegated with three games to spare after a defeat to West Ham United.\n\nUnexpected performances\n\nThere have been some strong performances by newly promoted clubs in the Premier League \u2013 particularly in its first few seasons. Blackburn Rovers were among the three teams who won promotion to the Premier League upon its formation, and bankrolled by owner Jack Walker's millions they were able to attract some of the best players in English football \u2013 most notably \u00a33.6 million national record signing Alan Shearer. They finished fourth in their first Premier League season after leading in the early stages. Ipswich Town, one of the other promoted teams that season, were among the top five clubs as late as February 1993 and were being tipped as surprise title contenders, but a late slump in form dragged them down to 16th place.\n\n1990s\nIn the second season of the Premier League, newly promoted Newcastle United finished third \u2013 the same position which was occupied by another newly promoted side, Nottingham Forest, the following year. Except Ipswich Town in 2001, this was the last time a newly promoted club finished in the top five.\n\nMiddlesbrough finished 12th in the 1995\u201396 season after promotion, but 10 games into the season they occupied fourth place \u2013 high enough for UEFA Cup qualification - \u2013 and were being touted as outsiders for the Premier League title.\n\nIn 1996\u201397, newly promoted Leicester City achieved top-flight survival for the first time since 1986 by finishing ninth and also winning the Football League Cup to end their 33-year trophy drought. Middlesbrough had been relegated from the Premier League in 1997 two years after promotion (though only through a points deduction) and were promoted back at the first attempt, and in their first Premier League campaign following relegation they finished ninth in the Premier League and only narrowly missed out on UEFA Cup qualification.\n\nSunderland were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions with a new record of 105 league points in 1999 and marked their return to the top flight by finishing seventh and only missing out on UEFA Cup qualification on goal difference.\n\n2000s\nCharlton Athletic's return to the Premier League as Division One champions for the 2000\u201301 season was marked with a ninth-place finish \u2013 their highest for some 50 years.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, Blackburn Rovers returned to the Premier League two years after relegation and marked it with their first League Cup triumph, and a late surge in form following the trophy win took them clear of the relegation zone to a tenth-place finish. Manchester City returned to the Premier League in 2002 a year after relegation by securing the Division One title, and marked their return to the top flight with a ninth-place finish \u2013 their highest in a decade. After two seasons of newly promoted clubs either being relegated or narrowly scraping survival, West Ham United finished ninth in the Premier League in 2005\u201306 and almost won the FA Cup (only missing out due to a late Liverpool equaliser and a penalty shoot-out defeat), while fellow promoted side Wigan Athletic enjoyed an even more remarkable season. They were rarely outside the top five in the first half of the season, and then reached their first major cup final \u2013 the League Cup final \u2013 which they lost to Manchester United. They eventually finished 10th in the final table.\n\nReading reached the top flight for the first time in their history for the 2006\u201307 season and finished eighth \u2013 narrowly missing out on UEFA Cup qualification.\n\nHull City reached the Premier League for the 2008\u201309 season, the first time they had ever appeared in the top flight and all the more remarkable considering they had begun the decade almost bankrupt in the league's basement division. An excellent start to the season saw them level on points in third place with the leading pack of Liverpool and Arsenal in mid-October, though their season gradually fell away from December onwards and they ended up surviving by just one point. Hull were relegated the following season but made a return to the Premier League several years later by finishing second in the 2012\u201313 Championship season, with experienced manager Steve Bruce in charge. Hull again survived their first season in the Premier League following promotion, finishing 16th in the 2013\u201314 season but they were relegated again the following season after drawing 0\u20130 with Manchester United on the last day of the season.  Hull sticked with Bruce after relegation, who in the 2015\u201316 season got Hull promoted for the second time as manager through winning the 2016 Championship play-off final. Bruce left the club during the summer after disagreements with the board and frustration over the club's lack of transfer activity, leaving Hull in a crisis going into their Premier League season without a manager and an incredibly small squad of only 13 fit senior professionals. The season started well under caretaker manager Mike Phelan, winning their opening two fixtures, including a shock win over champions Leicester City on the opening day of the season, however as expected, Hull struggled throughout the season and were relegated, not helped by discontent amongst fans over the club's ownership, along with the lack of investment with regards to player transfers and effective preparation while the club was up for sale, and poor performances on the pitch. Marco Silva replaced Phelan in January and rejuvenated the team, getting some good results, in particular in a 2\u20130 home win over Liverpool and a point away at Old Trafford, however the damage had been done in the first half of the season, and Hull finished 18th. The following summer saw a large number of player departures and a new manager joined Hull, Leonid Slutsky.\n\nStoke City returned to the top flight at the same time as Hull's promotion, having been in exile for 23 years and returned in reasonable style with a 12th-place finish. Stoke have since established themselves as a consistent mid-table Premier League club, under the management of Tony Pulis and more recently Mark Hughes, finishing 9th in the league for three consecutive seasons between 2013\u201314 to 2015\u201316, before eventually relegated in 2017-18.\n\nBirmingham City, who had two spells in the Premier League between 2002 and 2008, returned to the elite for the 2009\u201310 campaign one season after relegation and secured a ninth-place finish, the club's best in decades and one of their highest ever.\n\n2010s\n\nNorwich City returned to the top flight for the first time in seven years, a season when the team had to win against Fulham at Craven Cottage in order to survive but were relegated straight back to The Championship after a 6\u20130 defeat. After the 2008\u201309 season, the club were relegated to League One, only to win the league at the first time of asking despite an opening day 7\u20131 record league loss to Colchester United. The season after in 2010\u201311, Norwich earned their place back amongst the elite by gaining the second automatic promotion spot in the a Championship, with many pundits tipping the team for immediate relegation. However, they were consistent for most of the season, never being in any real danger of relegation, before finishing the season in 12th position. Norwich remained a Premier League club for two more seasons under the management of Chris Hughton but were relegated in the 2013\u201314 season, with the club sacking Hughton towards the tail end of the season as Norwich sat just above the relegation zone in 17th, appointing Neil Adams only to be relegated by not winning any of their remaining five games. Norwich bounced back to the Premier League at the first time of asking, under new manager Alex Neil, after winning the 2015 Championship play-off final against Middlesbrough, however their stay back in the Premier League was short lived as Norwich finished 19th in the 2015\u201316 season. They returned again in 2019\u201320 but were relegated again in last place after a terrible season despite a shocking 3\u20132 win over defending champions Manchester City. Their fate was sealed with a 4\u20130 defeat to West Ham United. They have bounced back and returned for 2021\u201322. However, as of Christmas 2021, the club sits at the bottom of the table at 20th place.\n\nSwansea City also returned to the top flight at the same time as Norwich\u2019s promotion, having been playing below the top division since their relegation in 1983, and were also in danger of leaving The Football League itself in 2003, only for a 4\u20132 win over Hull City on the final day at Vetch Field to confirm their survival. Two seasons later, in 2004\u201305, the team won League Two, under the guidance of Kenny Jackett, before following this up three seasons later, by winning League One under Roberto Mart\u00ednez gaining a club record 92 points in the process. In the 2010\u201311 season, Swansea finally won promotion to the Premier League being the first Welsh team to do so, under Brendan Rodgers, after beating his former team Reading 4\u20132 in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThe season proved successful for the Welsh team, despite being heavily tipped by many pundits to be relegated. They returned in reasonable style finishing in 11th position, only one goal away to being in 10th position. Their season saw surprise wins over Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool. The team also despite being newly promoted, scored the fastest goal of the 2011\u201312 season, when Andrea Orlandi scored within 24 seconds against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 4\u20134 draw at the Liberty Stadium, a match that also confirmed Swansea's place in the 2012\u201313 Premier League season. In the 2012\u201313 season, Swansea qualified for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League by winning the 2012\u201313 Football League Cup and finishing ninth in the Premier League. They would spend a further five seasons in the Premier League before being relegated on the final day during the 2017\u201318 season after a 2\u20131 loss to also relegated Stoke City. \n\nIn 2015, AFC Bournemouth earned promotion to the Premier League by winning the 2014\u201315 Football League Championship under the stewardship of young English manager Eddie Howe. The promotion formed part of an incredible rise up the Football League with the club having been close to liquidation only ten years prior when they were in League Two, and as recently as 2008 had gone into administration and nearly lost their Football League status. The club have since surprised many by consolidating themselves in the Premier League, finishing 16th in their first season in the top flight and then an impressive 9th in their second season, in spite of having limited spending power in relation to modern day Premier League figures. Key to Bournemouth's success was keeping a core of home-grown players together that had risen through the leagues with the club, Harry Arter and Marc Pugh establishing themselves at the highest level, having been lower league players beforehand. They stayed in the Premier League for five seasons before getting relegated in 2019\u201320 on the final day of the season.\n\nIn 2017, Brighton & Hove Albion earned promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history after finishing second in the 2016\u201317 EFL Championship, having missed out on top spot to Newcastle United on the final day of the season after failing to win any of their final three games. Their first Premier League season went well and they secured their Premier League status after a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester United on 4 May 2018, finishing in 15th place. They have since maintained their Premier League status for a further three seasons finishing in 17th, 15th and 16th in the 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 seasons respectively.\n\nAlso in 2017, Huddersfield Town also earned promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history by winning the 2017 Championship play-off final, having finished in 19th place in the Championship the season prior and having only had a \u00a312 million playing budget in their possession, a significantly lower figure in comparison to other clubs such as Aston Villa, who were backed by the wealthy Recon Group and were in receipt of parachute payments. Many had tipped Huddersfield to struggle in the Championship in a similar manner to previous seasons, however the club made an unexpected appointment in former Borussia Dortmund II manager David Wagner, who employed a high-tempo pressing style of play and made shrewd acquisitions in the transfer market, mainly utilising loan deals from larger clubs and with Christopher Schindler being the club's record transfer at \u00a31.2 million. They finished 16th in the 2017\u201318 season, after drawing with Manchester City and Chelsea. However, Huddersfield was relegated in the following season, suffering relegation in the month of March; becoming only the second team in Premier League history to achieve this feat. Manager David Wagner left Huddersfield by mutual consent in January with the club rooted to the bottom of the table having only earned 11 points throughout the season, and his replacement Jan Siewert could not mastermind an unlikely survival, losing eight of his first nine games in charge; a solitary victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers, plus a later draw vs. Manchester United and Southampton, left Huddersfield finishing on 16 points and 20 points adrift of safety. \n\nIn 2018, Wolverhampton Wanderers was promoted to the Premier League only five years after enduring a \"double drop\", being relegated from the 2011\u201312 Premier League and 2012\u201313 Football League Championship. In the 2018\u201319 Premier League season, Wolves finished seventh and earned 57 points, the most by a promoted team since Ipswich Town's 66-point finish in 2000\u201301. They also qualified for the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League through league position.\n\nIn 2019, Sheffield United, who returned to the Premier League after 12 years, finished ninth in the 2019\u201320 season with 54 points, only missing out on European football by five points. They were the second promoted team in as many seasons to finish with at least 50 points and did not lose a single away game until December when they lost 2\u20130 at Manchester City.\n\nSecond season syndrome\n\nSecond season syndrome is a downturn in form suffered by a team in their second season after promotion, having performed relatively well in their first season. In the Football League, Swansea City were a notable example of this so-called syndrome. Once they got promoted to old Division One in 1981\u201382 and led the league before finishing 6th, but they were relegated following season and in the next three years they crashed into Division Four and narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference. Swansea City were able to return to top flight only 28 years later, competing in the Premier League until 2017\u201318. Another notable example was Ipswich Town, who were promoted to the Premier League after a five-year exile and finished fifth in 2000\u201301, qualifying for the UEFA Cup, but were relegated a year later. In 2005\u201306, for instance, newly promoted West Ham United and Wigan Athletic finished ninth and tenth in the Premier League (it was Wigan's first season as a top division club) and were runners-up in the FA Cup and Football League Cup respectively. The following season, however, they narrowly avoided relegation with respective 17th and 15th-place finishes. In 2006\u201307, Reading were playing top division football for the first time in their history and finished eighth in the Premier League, with only a defeat on the final day of the season preventing them from qualifying for the UEFA Cup. A year later, however, a drastic loss of form in the second half of the season saw them dragged from mid-table to occupy the final relegation place, and they were relegated on the last day of the season. Another example is Birmingham City, who after securing ninth position with over 50 points, were then relegated in 2010\u201311 after suffering a horrific downturn in form despite claiming the Carling Cup. Indeed, that season saw a surprisingly high number of points claimed by the clubs that went down, with West Ham United finishing bottom with 33 points, which would have secured 17th place the previous year, and Birmingham and shock 'new boys' Blackpool both going down on 39 points. In 2017\u201318 Huddersfield Town were playing Premier League football for the first time in their history, and top flight football for the first time since 1972 and finished 16th, securing top flight status with 1 game to spare. However, they were relegated next season after winning a mere 3 matches from their first 32 and becoming just the second club ever to be relegated in March (after Derby County). This could in part be attributed to burn out, newly promoted or under resourced clubs lack the strength in depth of larger established teams leaving them more vulnerable to injuries of key players and exhaustion from lack of rotation allowing players to rest. The same can be said about Sheffield United who began the 2020\u201321 season with just two points from 14 games after finishing 9th the previous season. They got relegated with six games to spare after a 1\u20130 defeat against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nSecond season syndrome is far from guaranteed, however; after surviving their first season back in the Premier League in 2014\u201315 by six points, Leicester City stunned the football world by winning the Premier League the following season. In addition, in Bournemouth's second season, they managed to finish 9th after a strong performance from them at the end of the season. Furthermore, in Burnley's second season after their third promotion, they managed to finish 7th and qualify for the Europa League \u2014 their best in 54 years. Another example is Aston Villa in the 2020\u201321 season. They only survived by a point in the previous season when they were promoted but finished 11th in 2020\u201321 with over 50 points thanks to a strong start, including an incredible 7-2 win over defending champions Liverpool.\n\nProject Big Picture\nProject Big Picture was a plan proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool F.C. and their owners Joel Glazer and John W. Henry.  The plan would have diverted \u00a3250 million to support Football League clubs and reduce the size of the Premier League to 18 teams.  It was opposed by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nTottenham Hotspur expressed support for the plans. It was reported that other Premier League teams had either expressed concerns about the plan or were opposed to it. Despite being one of the teams that would seemingly benefit from the project, it has been said that West Ham United were \"very much against\" it.  Critics of the plan stated that it would put the \"Big Six\" clubs into a position of control over all of English football. The Daily Telegraph described the plan as a \"brazen power grab\", and \"a hostile takeover spun as a rescue package\" by the top clubs. However, the plan was supported by EFL chair Rick Parry and the vast majority of EFL clubs.\n\nIn a virtual meeting on 14 October 2020, all 20 Premier League clubs rejected the proposal, but agreed to further financial assistance to League One and League Two teams.\n\nSee also\n Doing a Leeds\n Premier League parachute and solidarity payments\n\nReferences\n\nEnglish Football League\nPremier League", "machine_text": " The Premier League\u2013Football League gulf The Premier League and the Football League are the two highest divisions in English football, and have a long history of competing for the best players and the biggest crowds.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Demonizing the enemy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Demonizing the enemy, demonization of the enemy or dehumanization of the enemy is a propaganda technique which promotes an idea about the enemy being a threatening, evil aggressor with only destructive objectives. Demonization is the oldest propaganda technique aimed to inspire hatred toward the enemy necessary to hurt them more easily, to preserve and mobilize allies and demoralize the enemy.\n\nBasic criteria \n\nBecause of the frequent misuse of the term demonization, it is deprived of its potential to be analyzed. That is why Jules Boykoff defined four criteria of enemy demonization:\n Both media and state employ frames to portray inherent nature of so-called enemy mostly in moral terms.\n The character of the opponent is depicted in a Manichean way, as good against evil.\n The state is the origin of such demonological portraying.\n There is no significant counterclaim from the state.\n\nHistory \nThe demonization of the enemy has been routinely conducted throughout the history. Thucydides recorded examples in Ancient Greece.\n\nPhillip Knightley believed that demonization of the enemy (first enemy leaders and later enemy individuals) became a predictable pattern followed by Western media, the final stage being atrocities.\n\nDuring the Second World War, propaganda documentaries that contained enemy demonization and flag-waving patriotism were prepared by the US State Department and other state institutions of the United States and distributed, after being approved.\n\nPersonification and demonization \n\nDemonization of the enemy can be much easier to conduct if the enemy is personalized in one man, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was demonized by the Russian popular media during the First World War.\n\nConsequences \n\nThe strategy of demonization of the enemy unavoidably leads to a vicious cycle of atrocities, which was elaborated by many authors including Carl von Clausewitz. Demonization of the enemy makes diplomatic solution impossible and inevitably leads into the war or worsening of relations. Depicting the enemy as particularly evil inspires feelings that make killings more easy.\n\nThe portrayal of one's enemy as demonic has often led to the treatment of the whole population or political apparatus associated with the enemy group or leader as equally demonic. This also often results in a tendency to reduce an enemy's more complex motives to simple promotion of pure evil.\n\nThe Chinese revolutionary theorist Mao Zedong held that the demonization of oneself by the enemy was a good thing. He said, \"It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work.\" (To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939))\n\nSee also \n Ole Holsti: Inherent bad faith model\n Psychological warfare\n Psychological operations (United States)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \n \n\nPropaganda techniques\nPropaganda", "machine_text": " Demonizing the enemy The demonizing of the enemy is the deliberate use of misleading or untrue statements in order to demonize an enemy, to make them appear more harmful, dangerous, or immoral than they really are. The demonizing of the enemy is a common technique used in politics, media, and propaganda. The goal of demonizing the enemy is to make the enemy less sympathetic, and to help justify, or gain support for, an attack or other actions against the enemy. The demonizing of the enemy is often associated with the use of the enemy image, in which the enemy is depicted in a way that makes them appear more evil or dangerous than they really are. This can include the use of negative stereotypes, or the portrayal of the enemy as a monster. The demonizing of the enemy can also include the use of lies or misinformation in order to portray the enemy in a negative light. For example, the enemy may be portrayed as being responsible for actions or events that they did not actually cause, or as having motivations that are not actually true. The demonizing of the enemy can also include the use of personal attacks or character assassination in order to make the enemy appear more harmful or immoral than they really are. For example, the enemy may be portrayed as being corrupt, or as having unethical or immoral personal habits.

It is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). It contributes to conservation and research through links with conservation projects and its links with universities in nearby Liverpool, as well as Chester and Manchester.\n\nHistory\nThe park was opened in July 1971 by Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby and Jimmy Chipperfield using the expertise of general manager Laurence Tennant MBE, formerly the Chief Game Warden of Parks in Uganda and Botswana. Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional  of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars.\n\nThe park was also home to a former RAF airfield which closed at the end of World War II. The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 \u2013 November 1944.\n\nThe park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012. The park hosted the finish of Stage Two of the 2012 Tour of Britain cycling event and hosted Stage Three of the 2013 Tour in September of that year.\n\nZoological collection\nSituated around Knowsley Hall on the ancestral estate of the Earl of Derby, the reserve is home to different animals. The Derby Estate have a tradition of keeping animals, ever since the famous artist and nonsense-poet Edward Lear was employed there in the 19th century to paint pictures of the Earl's collection.\n\nBaboons\nThe park is open to the public and customers drive around the park in their own vehicles. There is a bypass route past the baboons for those who wish to avoid the risk of the baboons damaging their cars. In 2009 the baboons made the news all over the world when a video was released showing how they were intelligent and curious enough to open car roofboxes.\n\nTiger Trail \nAmur Tiger Trail opened 25 May 2018, home to the Amur Tiger otherwise known as the Siberian Tiger. The area is 10,000m2 and includes forested areas, natural streams and ponds.\n\nThe Equatorial Trail \nThis exhibit focuses on animals who thrive in habitats around the Earth's Equator. The exhibit also houses the 'Equatorial Express', a small train which visitors can ride to gain a unique viewpoint of the animals. 4 animal species are housed in this exhibit, the South American tapir, Sitatunga, Rhea and the Capybara.\n\nAfrican Elephant \nUntil 2017 the park housed a herd of 4 adult cows named Tana, Ashanti, Nala and Juba. They were transported to Zoo Parc d'Beauval, France to enter the European Breeding Programme and allow for transformations on Knowsley Safari's Foot Safari. Knowsley previously housed a bull named Nissim, who collapsed in June 2014. Knowsley also recently lost their cow named Shaba due to a long battle with elephant arthritis.\n\nSouthern White Rhinoceros \nKnowsley's crash of 11 adult rhinos is one of the most successful and genetically diverse breeding groups in Europe. The latest calf (as at 4 June 2016), Nomvula (Mother of Rain \u2013 a reference to the recent wet weather), born to mum Meru and is the 19th to be born at the facility in the last 40 years. Nomvula is Meru's 6th calf and was born on 2 January 2016.\n\nSafari Drive \n\nThe Safari Drive is the park's main attraction and contains over 29 species of animals in 7 zones.\n\nZone 1+11 - Eastern Asia \nThis zone contains: P\u00e8re David's deer, Yak, Kiang and Bactrian camel.\n\nZone 2+8 - Southern Asia \nThis zone contains: Blackbuck, Nilgai, Eld's deer, Chital (Axis Deer) and Barasingha.\n\nZone 3+4+6 - African Savannah \nZone 6 is over 100 acres and contains over a mile of road.

Red river hogs and marmosets were also added to the walkaround section, as well as an outdoor pool.\n\nAnimal care\nIn January 2011, local animal rights activists held a peaceful demonstration after an inspection by government vets found one instance of a breach of regulations on the disposal of animal \u2018by-products\u2019. The park has since installed an enclosure for the storage of animal carcasses before disposal.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nKnowsley Safari Park official website\n\nMetropolitan Borough of Knowsley\nTourist attractions in Merseyside\nZoos in England\nBuildings and structures in Merseyside\nZoos established in 1971\n1971 establishments in England\nSafari parks", "machine_text": " Knowsley Safari Park, also previously known as Knowsley Zoo, is a safari park located in Knowsley, Merseyside, England.

He was a 12th-century Indian Muslim monarch, who according to popular tradition, founded the city of Hyderabad in the year 1589. Malik Ek was born in a family of Persianate Turks who had recently immigrated to India. His father's name was Daud. The family had settled in the city of Daulatabad, which was then a part of the Delhi sultanate. As a young man, Malik Ek worked as a chief guard (eunuch) of the household of the sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish. Iltutmish was a member of the Mamluk dynasty of Delhi, which was a dynasty of Central Asian origin. The Mamluks were a caste of military slaves who had risen to power in the Delhi sultanate. After the death of Iltutmish in 1236, Malik Ek and his family were granted a jagir (fiefdom) in the Deccan region of southern India by the new sultan, Alauddin Khan. The Deccan was a rich agricultural region that was home to a large population of Hindu rulers. The Delhi sultanate had recently begun a campaign to expand its influence into the Deccan. Malik Ek and his family were the first Muslims to settle in the region. They were followed by other Muslim families who were granted land by the Delhi sultanate. Over time, the city of Hyderabad became a major center of trade and commerce, and a key ally of the Delhi sultanate in its efforts to conquer the Deccan. In 1589, the city of Hyderabad was attacked by the Vijayanagara Empire, a Hindu kingdom that ruled over much of the Deccan region. The city was conquered and occupied by the Vijayanagara Empire. The Vijanagara king, Sri Krishnadevaraya, granted the city of Hyderabad to Malik Ek as a jagir (fiefdom). Malik Ek then became the ruler of Hyderabad, which was now a part of the Vijayanagara Empire. He was given the title of \"Malik\" (equivalent to \"Lord\" or \"King\"). Under the rule of Malik Ek, the city of Hyderabad became a major center of trade and commerce.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15016234}

Starting on 7 June at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson. \n\nThe match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world.\n\nTour results\n\nThis tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.\n\nControversy\nHaving returned home from the tour, there were claims in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper:\nMy attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on and off the field.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"88th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The 88th Rifle Division was twice formed as an infantry division of the Red Army, first as part of the prewar buildup of forces. In its first formation in the far north it had an unusual shtat (table of organization and equipment) probably to facilitate its movement in the roadless tundra and forests of that region. During the Winter War against Finland it saw action in the fighting around Salla. Its organization again proved beneficial in the spring of 1942 during the first stages of the Great Patriotic War. It played a large role in holding and then pushing back the Finnish III Army Corps during Operation Silver Fox and for this success was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division.\n\nA new 88th began forming in April, 1942 based on the first formation of the 39th Rifle Brigade, mostly in the Moscow Military District and was soon assigned to the 31st Army of Western Front; it would remain in that Army for the duration of the war. It took part in the savage and mostly fruitless fighting around the Rzhev salient into the winter of 1942/43 and then in the summer offensive that liberated Smolensk. During the following fall it became badly depleted as Western Front repeatedly attempted to batter its way through the German defenses to Orsha. After rebuilding in the spring of 1944 it served as part of 3rd Belorussian Front during Operation Bagration, soon being awarded a battle honor as well as the Order of the Red Banner. During this offensive it reached the border of East Prussia and won a second decoration in the unsuccessful Gumbinnen-Goldap Operation. During the East Prussian Offensive in January, 1945 it made steady progress, eventually earning its third Order after the battle for the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After the East Prussian campaign the 31st Army was railed south to Czechoslovakia where the 88th ended the war marching on Prague. Despite a fine record as a fighting unit the division was soon disbanded.\n\n1st Formation\nThe 88th Rifle Division began forming for the first time on the day the war began in Europe, September 1, 1939 at Arkhangelsk in the Arkhangelsk Military District. During November it was transported across the White Sea to Belomorsk. By December 1 the division was developing a two-pronged attack on Salla in cooperation with the 122nd Rifle Division. The intermediate objective was the town of Kemij\u00e4rvi en route to Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland. By December 17 the 122nd Division was less than 30km from the former when it was struck by Finnish counterattacks and forced to retreat on some sectors. As the 88th came up it was fed into the fighting piecemeal with little result. By the end of the month the two Soviet divisions were hard-pressed to hold the ground they had gained and under fresh attacks beginning on January 2, 1940 were forced back to a line of ridges 3km west of M\u00e4rk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi. There they dug in and remained for the duration of the war.\n\nMaj. Gen. Andrei Ivanovich Zelentsov took command of the division on June 14, 1940. As of June 22, 1941 the division's order of battle was as follows:\n 426th Rifle Regiment\n 611th Rifle Regiment\n 758th Rifle Regiment\n 401st Light Artillery Regiment\n 269th Antitank Battalion\n 147th Reconnaissance Battalion\n 222nd Sapper Battalion\n 221st Signal Battalion\n 368th Mortar Battalion (until October 16, 1941)\n 288th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n 128th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n 184th Motor Transport Battalion\n 154th Field Bakery\n 189th Field Artillery Remount Workshop\n 191st Field Postal Station\n 373rd Field Office of the State Bank\nZelentsov also served as the acting commander of Arkhangelsk Military District from June 27 to July 5. The division remained near Arkhangelsk until the beginning of August, when it was shipped across the White Sea to Murmansk. Sharp states that it's possible the 88th had a special organization for operations in the roadless arctic terrain because it did not have a howitzer regiment and when it was disembarked from 10 small transports from August 9\u201314 it had just 7,818 personnel on strength with 58 artillery pieces of all calibres, 22 trucks and 1,928 horses in total. It also had a full reconnaissance battalion versus the standard company. This does not match any prewar shtat but appears to be a lightly-armed organization utilizing horse packing for most of its transport needs.\n\nThe German-Finnish Operation Silver Fox had begun on July 1 with the goal of cutting the Murmansk railway and on August 7 the Finnish III Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Hjalmar Siilasvuo, captured Kestenga. By now he was 65\u00a0km short of his objective of Loukhi. The Soviet 14th Army sent in a group of reserves known as the Grivnik Brigade which slowed the Finnish drive. At this point the 88th joined the Kemskaya Operations Group and took over defense of the Kestenga-Loukhi road, one of the few avenues of operation in this mostly trackless wilderness. On August 15, while leading the division as it attempted to establish defensive positions along the Sofiangi River, General Zelentsov was killed in a German air attack; he was replaced five days later by Col. Vladimir Aleksandrovich Solovyov. By this time the Finnish forces were exhausted and on August 25 General Siilasvuo called a halt to regroup.\n\nAfter being reinforced by units of the German XXXVI Mountain Corps the Finns resumed their offensive on October 30. The 88th Division had also been reinforced and had had time to improve its positions. Despite this the attackers made progress and by November 6 two battalions of the 426th Rifle Regiment and a company of the 611th Regiment were fighting in encirclement. The next day two Finnish and one German battalion that had earlier infiltrated between the two Regiments were driven back 45\u00a0km along the Kestenga-Loukhi road by other Soviet forces. On November 9 the encircled battalions of the 426th, low on ammunition and without food, were forced to break out; only 275 men returned to friendly lines. On November 16 the offensive subsided, in part due to heavy casualties on the Axis side but also due to diplomatic pressure from the United States government which threatened consequences for Finland if its supply deliveries to the USSR were interrupted. However this might have been, the division was credited with stopping the Finnish drive and largely in recognition of this it was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division on March 17, 1942, one of only two Guards divisions created (the other being the 10th Guards Rifle) in the Arctic.\n\nOn February 22, 1943 two soldiers of the division would be posthumously made Heroes of the Soviet Union for their roles in the November battles. Krasnoarmeets Mikhail Egorovich Rodionov had been a machinegunner in the 2nd Battalion of the 426th Rifle Regiment. While fighting in encirclement Rodionov helped to drive off seven enemy attacks with his fire, despite being wounded. Following a second wound he lost consciousness; when he revived he killed himself with a grenade before being captured. Cpl. Fyodor Afanasevich Luzan commanded a radio platoon of the 758th Rifle Regiment. On November 24, while fighting for the railway station on the Loukhi-Kastenga line his battalion was surrounded by enemy tanks and infantry. In order to help his comrades to break through to friendly lines Luzan called in artillery fire on his own position. Soon after, as SS troops were breaking into his dugout, he blew up himself and his radio with a grenade, taking several attackers with him.\n\n2nd Formation\nThe 88th began forming again on April 29, 1942 based on the 39th Rifle Brigade at Kizner in the Urals Military District.\n\n39th Rifle Brigade\nThe 1st formation of the 39th Rifle Brigade began in October, 1941 at Alma-Ata in the Central Asia Military District. It was formed from the Alma-Ata and Fruzensk Rifle-Machine gun Schools, largely with students of Kazakh nationality. In December the brigade was shipped north and by January 1, 1942 was in the reserves of Northwestern Front, under command of Col. V. G. Noziyak. It was then assigned to 4th Shock Army taking part in the Toropets-Kholm Offensive and on January 21 was one of the units recognized for its role in the liberation of Toropets and the capture of the German supply base there. By the end of the month 4th Shock came under command of Kalinin Front and the brigade remained in the Toropets salient to the west of the German-held Rzhev salient until April when it was pulled back well east of Moscow where it was disbanded to form the cadre for the new 88th Rifle Division.\n\nAlthough it physically formed in the Urals the new 88th Division, based on an existing cadre, was very soon assigned to the Moscow Military District. Its order of battle was similar to that of the 1st formation:\n 426th Rifle Regiment\n 611th Rifle Regiment\n 758th Rifle Regiment\n 401st Artillery Regiment\n 269th Antitank Battalion\n 222nd Sapper Battalion\n 147th Reconnaissance Company\n 221st Signal Company\n 288th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n 128th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n 598th Motor Transport Battalion\n 489th Field Bakery\n 1004th Divisional Veterinary Hospital\n 1596th Field Postal Station\n 1642nd Field Office of the State Bank\n Divisional Training Battalion\nCol. Andrei Filippovich Bolotov was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming. In June it was assigned to the 4th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and then in July to 31st Army in Western Front.\n\nBattles for Rzhev\nWestern Front began its part in the First Rzhev\u2013Sychyovka Offensive Operation on August 4. A powerful artillery preparation reportedly knocked out 80 percent of German weapons, after which the German defenses were penetrated on both sides of Pogoreloe Gorodishche and the 31st Army's mobile group rushed through the breaches towards Zubtsov. By the evening of August 6 the breach in the German 9th Army's front had expanded up to 30\u00a0km wide and up to 25\u00a0km deep. The following day the STAVKA appointed Army Gen. G. K. Zhukov to coordinate the offensives of Western and Kalinin Fronts; Zhukov proposed to liberate Rzhev with 31st and 30th Armies as soon as August 9. However, heavy German counterattacks, complicated by adverse weather soon slowed the advance drastically. On August 23 the 31st Army, in concert with elements of the 29th Army, finally liberated Zubtsov. While this date is officially considered the end of the offensive in Soviet sources, in fact bitter fighting continued west of Zubtsov into mid-September. At dawn on September 8, 29th and 31st Armies went on a determined offensive to seize the southern part of Rzhev. Despite resolute attacks through the following day against the German 161st Infantry Division the 31st made little progress. It suspended its attacks temporarily on September 16 but resumed them with three divisions, including the 88th, on its right flank on September 21\u201323 with similar lack of success. Over the course of the fighting from August 4 to September 15 the Army suffered a total of 43,321 total losses in personnel.\n\nIn the planning for Operation Mars a directive was sent on September 28/29 from the command of Western Front to 31st Army, \"consisting of the 88th, 239th, 336th and 20th Guards Rifle Divisions, the 32nd and 145th Tank Brigades... [to advance] along the Osuga, Artemovo, and Ligastaevo axis.\" The offensive finally began on November 25 when the Army's shock group, consisting of the above forces minus the 20th Guards, attacked the German 102nd Infantry Division. That division's history recorded:In three days of fighting the tank brigades were decimated and the rifle divisions suffered heavy losses, up to 50 percent on the first day alone. The Army then went over to the defense. On December 11 it went back to the attack, in support of 20th Army. These attacks continued until the 18th. In February, 1943 the armies of Western and Kalinin Fronts began preparing for what would become the Rzhev-Vyasma Offensive Operation. 31st Army was to be prepared to attack by February 20\u201321. In the event these plans were delayed and eventually superseded when German 9th Army launched Operation B\u00fcffel on March 1 and began its phased withdrawal from the salient, pursued by 31st and other armies through the rest of the month.\n\nInto Western Russia and Belarus\nIn June the 88th was assigned to the new 45th Rifle Corps, along with the 220th and 331st Rifle Divisions. On August 7, the first day of Operation Suvorov, the only real Soviet success was achieved by 31st Army against XXXIX Panzer Corps in the Yartsevo sector. The main effort was made by the 36th and 45th Corps, the latter of which had the 220th and 331st Divisions in first echelon and the 88th in second. The attack gathered steam late in the day as the Corps attacked east of the Vop River. It faced the inexperienced 113th Infantry Division which had only been at the front for two weeks. Between 1800 and 2000 hours the Corps overran one German battalion and threw another aside; an hour later an artillery battalion had also been overrun and it was clear the 113th's front was breaking apart. During the night two German regiments fell back 2\u00a0km where a main battle line was reestablished behind the 6m-wide Vedosa River. Sensing confusion in the German ranks the commander of 31st Army, Maj. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky, committed his mobile group to break through to the Minsk-Moscow highway just 6\u00a0km to the south. For a brief moment it seemed the 45th Corps and the 42nd Guards Tank Brigade might achieve a breakthrough.\n\nThe attack was resumed at dawn on August 8 and gained more ground from the 113th Infantry which was now near collapse. By early afternoon the 260th Grenadier Regiment cracked after losing a key position and the 220th Division surged into the gap just east of the Vop. The only substantial reserve available to German 4th Army was the 18th Panzergrenadier Division which was ordered into the counterattack. As it arrived it could only fill the gap left by the routed units of the 113th. The next day the two Soviet corps continued to try to batter their way through the German line but were stymied by 18th Panzergrenadiers; during this fighting Colonel Bolotov was killed by German tank or assault gun fire on his command post. He would be replaced by Col. Gavrill Alekseevich Bulanov on August 12. The 42nd Guards Tanks failed to reach the highway and lost 35 tanks in the process. On the other hand a major counterattack by 18th Panzergrenadier failed to restore the original front line due to heavy Soviet artillery fire and the obstacle of the Vedosa. After three days of fighting the situation was a stalemate, but the German reserve was fixed in place.\n\nWithin a few days the stalemate on the Smolensk front had become general. As of September 1 the 45th Corps consisted of the 88th and 251st Rifle Divisions. Western Front's offensive finally resumed on September 15 and by the end of the day Yartsevo was finally liberated. 45th Corps was transferred to 68th Army on September 18 and over the following week the 68th and 31st Armies pressed to encircle Smolensk, which was finally taken early in the morning of September 25. On October 9 the 88th came under the command of Col. Fyodor Trofimovich Kovtunov. During this month the division continued to advance towards the Belorussian border with 68th Army, but later that month 45th Corps rejoined the 31st Army.\n\nOrsha Offensives\n68th Army advanced westward south of the Dniepr River in early October with 45th Corps to the rear, closing up to the defenses of the German XXVII Army Corps late on October 8. The 88th immediately reinforced the assault of the 159th Rifle Division across the Mereya River, forcing the 18th Panzergrenadiers to withdraw westward. The division formed a forward detachment to pursue but the German division turned back towards the east and took up new defensive positions along the Rossasenka River on October 11. The Army prepared to resume its attacks the next day, but by now the 45th Corps was marching north to rejoin 31st Army.\n\n31st Army also began a new attempt to reach Orsha on October 12 with 45th Corps (now including the 220th Division) serving as its second echelon and reserve. The Army was positioned astride the Smolensk-Orsha highway north of the Dniepr. Western Front's offensive began after an artillery preparation of 85 minutes but 31st Army immediately stalled without any appreciable gains and at considerable cost. The offensive resumed the next day with reinforcements from the second echelon with no better results. Over the course of the fighting from October 12\u201318 the Front lost 5,858 personnel killed and 17,478 wounded. In preparation for a new effort 31st Army was further reinforced and regrouped its three corps south between the highway and the Dniepr, with 45th Corps in the center; the 88th and 251st Divisions were in first echelon and the 220th in second. The attack began early on October 21 following two hours and ten minutes of artillery fire. The shock groups smashed the defenses of the 197th Infantry Division between the villages of Redki and Novaya, at considerable cost and by early evening had penetrated 4\u00a0km deep on a front 1,000m wide toward the village of Kireevo, on the main rail line to Orsha. Two brigades of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps were committed into the penetration but were soon halted by heavy German fire from the flanks. The attack was resumed the next day but gained 1,000m at most. On October 24 the second echelon divisions were committed in a final effort to break the German defenses but failed in part due to artillery ammunition shortages. The offensive was halted at nightfall on October 26 by which time the offensive capabilities of 10th Guards and 31st Army were completely exhausted after gaining 4\u20136\u00a0km at a combined cost of 4,787 killed and 14,315 wounded.\n\nIn early November Western Front prepared for another attempt to break through the German defenses. The Front's first shock group consisted of the 10th Guards and 31st Armies on both sides of the Minsk highway, but by now their rifle divisions averaged only 4,500 personnel each. 45th Corps, south of Kireevo, faced the 119th Panzergrenadier Regiment of 25th Panzergrenadier Division. The 88th was in the first echelon when the attack began on November 14 after a three-and-a-half hour artillery and air preparation, but was soon stopped in its tracks due to heavy machine gun fire. The fighting continued over the next four days but 45th Corps gained no more than 400m at considerable cost. The STAVKA, however, ordered the offensive to continue, which it did beginning on November 30 after another regrouping. 31st and 10th Guards Armies were concentrated on a 12\u00a0km-wide sector from Osintori to the Dniepr, with the 31st focused on just 3\u00a0km of that with four divisions in first echelon and five in the second. In the event the attack made virtually no ground even after the second echelon was brought up, and the Front went over to the defense on December 5. The failure of the Orsha offensives was ascribed, apart from the strength of the German defenses, to a lack of training of Red Army replacements and a stereotyped use of artillery which did more to warn the German forces of attacks than to actually inflict damage. During December the STAVKA ordered Western Front to shift its efforts towards Vitebsk.\n\nOperation Bagration\nBy the beginning of January, 1944 the 88th, one of just four divisions remaining in 31st Army, had been assigned to the 114th Rifle Corps with the 251st Division, but by a month later it was a separate division. In February it came under command of 71st Rifle Corps with the 331st Division; it would remain in this Corps for most of the rest of the war. On February 27 General Gluzdovsky was ordered to prepare yet another assault on the Orsha axis in cooperation with 49th Army to his south. Since most of his Army was involved in offensive operations in the Babinavichy sector he only had his 71st Corps for this new attack, which began on March 5 and continued over the next four days. In the event the effort was unsuccessful at the cost to the two armies of another 1,898 killed and 5,639 wounded.\n\nOn April 11 Western Front was disbanded and 31st Army was assigned to the new 3rd Belorussian Front, where it would remain until the last month of the war. Over the next two months the 88th got a much needed respite for rebuilding and replenishment. In the buildup to the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Center on June 12\u201313 the 88th and 192nd Rifle Divisions of 71st Corps were shifted north to make room for the deployment of 11th Guards Army on the sector north of the Dniepr. When the offensive began with probing attacks on June 22 those of 31st Army were driven back by heavy artillery and mortar fire. The following day the first echelon divisions of 71st Corps broke the German defense north of the Dniepr, and advanced 3\u00a0km before being halted by increasing enemy resistance. During the fighting near the Kireevo railway station Sen. Lieutenant Anna Alekseevna Nikandrova, a Komsomol leader of the 426th Rifle Regiment, was distinguished for her gallantry. She used a hook ladder to help the soldiers of her company through an antitank ditch; later that day she blocked the embrasure of a German machinegun bunker with her body and was killed. On March 24, 1945 she was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nOver the next two days the 11th Guards and 5th Armies developed much more momentum along the Orsha and Bogushevsk axes, leaving 31st Army behind. Meanwhile, in the fighting around the Vitebsk salient, by June 24 the Soviets were torn by the classic dilemma of blitzkrieg warfare\u2014how many units to use to close the pocket and how many to keep pressing forward before the enemy had time to create defensive positions. 39th Army, which was responsible for 3rd Belorussian Front's part of this encirclement, had only its 84th Rifle Corps available for the battle for the city itself. As a result the 88th was moved north and attached to this Corps.\n\nElements of 39th Army linked up with forces of the 1st Baltic Front late on the 24th, leaving the German LIII Army Corps trapped in Vitebsk and in several smaller pockets along the road leading to the southwest. Over the next two days, as Hitler refused permission for the Corps to break out, the Soviet forces prepared to liquidate the pocket, which began at 0900 hours on June 27, preceded by a massive barrage of artillery and rockets. By noon the defenders had been broken into small pockets and during the afternoon the remnants surrendered. The German Army lost 20,000 killed and 10,000 prisoners. For its part in this fighting the division was awarded a battle honor:\n\nMinsk Offensive\nAfter the battle for Vitebsk the division advanced along the highway to Minsk to rejoin 71st Corps as it and the 36th Rifle Corps were consolidating the success of 5th Guards Tank Army which was operation ahead. 31st Army had been assigned a leading role in the liquidation of the defeated and mostly-encircled German 4th Army and the liberation of the Belorussian capital, which was completed on July 4. On the previous day a decree of the STAVKA read, in part:In addition to these battle honors on July 23 the 88th as a whole would receive the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the clearing of the city.\n\nVilnius-Kaunas Offensive\nDuring July 5\u20136 the 71st Corps pursued the German forces to the west, advancing up to 40\u00a0km and reaching a line from Pershaie eastward along the north bank of the Islach River as far as Rakuv. Over the next two days the entire Front continued its pursuit in the direction of Vilnius, which was reached by 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps on the morning of July 7. At the same time the 71st Corps was overcoming limited resistance in the Naliboki forest with the assistance of partisans and reached the Berezina River by the end of the day. The battle for Vilnius would continue until July 13, but meanwhile on July 8 the 31st Army had advanced another 25\u201330\u00a0km towards the Neman River. Hitler regarded this as his \"line of catastrophe\" to be held at any price. During July 12\u201313 the Army successfully pursued the German forces 55\u201360\u00a0km while its left flank advanced towards Grodno. By the next day most of the remaining defenders had begun deploying along the river line as 3rd Belorussian Front began preparing to force the Neman and also to liberate Kaunas.\n\nThat day a forward detachment of 36th Corps seized a crossing north of Grodno. On July 15 it was joined by elements of 71st Corps which took two more bridgeheads in the same area. At this point the Army commander, Col. Gen. V. V. Glagolev, was ordered to regroup his forces to the right flank and force the Neman along the Army's entire front. By the end of July 17 the 11th Guards, 5th and 31st Armies had together breached the river line on a 110\u00a0km front and repelled all counterattacks. After further gains the STAVKA ordered the Front over to a temporary defense on July 20. In recognition of the 88th's success in the Neman crossing on August 12 the 426th Regiment would be decorated with the Order of the Red Banner, while the 611th and 758th Regiments would each receive the Order of Aleksandr Nevsky.\n\nInto Germany\nThe temporary defensive was in part to prepare the Front for an invasion of East Prussia, which began at 0840 hours on July 29 following a 40-minute artillery preparation and airstrikes. On the first day 31st Army advanced as much as 15\u00a0km. On the following day the entire German defense along the Neman was crushed and the Front advanced rapidly towards Vilkavi\u0161kis. However the Army soon ran into woodland and lake terrain which slowed the advance as stubborn resistance developed. The operation was generally halted on July 31.\n\nGoldap-Gumbinnen Operation\nA new offensive into East Prussia began on October 16; 3rd Belorussian Front planned to drive directly from Gumbinnen through Insterburg to K\u00f6nigsberg. However, heavy German resistance soon stalled and even reversed this offensive. Goldap, to the south of the main drive, was soon taken, but German 4th Army committed its 102nd Panzer and F\u00fchrer Grenadier Brigades to the fighting and retook it on October 25. In a surprise attack by 31st Army on October 28 the town again changed hands, but the situation soon deteriorated as further counterattacks struck home. By November 3 the 611th Rifle Regiment was surrounded and was ordered to break out to friendly lines the next night. The regimental banner was entrusted to Sen. Sergeant Andrei Nikolaievich Elgin, a squad leader of the regiment's sub-machine gun company. Elgin had the banner wrapped around his torso under his uniform before leading a team of four men out of the town along a single path through the woods and marshland to the east. When the route was blocked by a German machine gun post he charged it, throwing grenades until it was destroyed with the help of his men. Although wounded, Elgin refused to give up the banner and continued on. Later, while crossing between the lines the party was spotted by the light of flares and a German group attempted to capture it. With his sub-machine gun and grenades Elgin killed eight of the enemy but received a second wound which proved fatal. He finally handed over the banner to a rescue group before he died. On March 20, 1945 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union. Despite the overall failure of the Goldap-Gumbinnen operation the 88th received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its efforts on November 14.\n\nOn December 19 Colonel Kovtunov handed his command of the division to Col. Aleksey Avkcentevich Kuzenny. This officer was in turn replaced on January 26, 1945 by Col. Ivan Sergeevich Lobanov, who was succeeded on February 14 by Col. Andrei Prokofevich Maltzev. Just two weeks later Maj. Gen. Nikita Sergeevich Samokhvalov took over command and continued to lead the 88th for the duration of the war.\n\nEast Prussian Offensive\nThe second attempt to destroy the German forces in East Prussia began on January 12, 1945. The objective of 3rd Belorussian Front was much as before: to penetrate the defenses north of the Masurian Lakes in the Insterburg region and then advance to launch a frontal attack on K\u00f6nigsberg. 31st Army remained on the Front's left flank and in the early going was ordered to firmly defend the front south of Goldap. The 88th remained in 71st Corps with the 220th and 331st Rifle Divisions. The Army went over to the offensive on January 22 and by the next day the German grouping facing it was in retreat. During that day the Corps captured the important road junction of Benkheim while the Army developed the offensive toward Angerburg and L\u00f6tzen, advancing more than 45\u00a0km before storming the heavily fortified strongpoint at the former location. The advance continued during the following days and on January 31 the division helped to take Heilsberg and Friedland. On April 5 the 426th Regiment would be recognized for its role in this fighting with the award of the Order of Aleksandr Nevsky.\n\n31st Army resumed its offensive on February 2 and soon captured the major road junction of Landsberg. However this was a crucial point for the German forces attempting to break out of the pocket that was forming around K\u00f6nigsberg. The 129th Infantry and 558th Grenadier and 24th Panzer Divisions launched powerful counterattacks in an effort to encircle the 71st Corps and while they were unable to break into Landsberg they isolated it for several days, bypassing to the north and south and causing considerable havoc in the Soviet rear areas. Once communications were restored the Corps continued its advance in the direction of Kanditten.\n\nDuring most of February and March the division took part in the final destruction of German 4th Army in the Heiligenbeil Pocket battles. On March 24 Sen. Sergeant Nikolai Mikhailovich Lazkov, an engineer reconnaissance squad leader of the 222nd Sapper Battalion, was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his work in Belarus from January to June 1944, during which time he led 96 night searches and defused 586 mines with his group. At the start of Operation Bagration, while operating behind enemy lines, his unit captured a bridge over the Orshitsa River north of Orsha and he organized its defense until relieved. He went on to a lengthy career in the postwar Soviet Army, eventually reaching the rank of colonel. On April 26 the 88th was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd Degree, for its part in the Heiligenbeil fighting.\n\nPostwar \nBy this time the division was travelling by train south with the rest of 31st Army to join the 1st Ukrainian Front in the Sudeten Mountains of Czechoslovakia. Arriving in the first days of May the 71st Corps saw little action, primarily providing flank security to the Front as it advanced on Prague and sweeping up prisoners. When the fighting ended the men and women of the division held the full title of 88th Rifle, Vitebsk, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov and Kutuzov Division.

She was sold for scrapping in 1973.\n\nNamesake\nCarl Welby Tinsman was born on 29 March 1924 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 19 August 1942 and served on the destroyer  as a seaman second class. While patrolling some  off the coast of Brazil on 10 March 1943, Eberle, ,  and  intercepted the German blockade runner Karin, flying a Dutch flag. Eberle and Savannah closed on the ship at flank speed and fired warning shots across her bow. Karins crew promptly set her afire and began to abandon ship. Tinsman was a member of the 14-man party from Eberle which boarded the blazing ship and attempted to save the ship. He continued his efforts to put out the fire until a sudden explosion of a demolition charge killed him. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHistory\nTinsman was laid down by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1943; launched on 26 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James Corley, sister of Seaman Tinsman; and commissioned on 26 June 1944.\n\nFollowing fitting out and trials, the destroyer got underway on 21 July 1944, proceeded to Bermuda on shakedown, and returned to Boston on 19 August. On 11 October, she departed Boston harbor and, the next day, joined a convoy bound, via the Panama Canal, for the South Pacific. She arrived at Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands late in November and, after training exercises, headed for New Guinea. On 2 December, she reached Hollandia, and was soon at sea again escorting a convoy to Leyte.\n\nOn 14 December, while Tinsman was in San Pedro Bay, a kamikaze plane grazed the bridge of a nearby tanker. A week later, the destroyer escort was back in New Guinea waters, anchoring in Humboldt Bay.

That night a large number of Japanese Shinyo boats attacked the American ships. Armed with impact bombs, these small craft swarmed out of the darkness and attacked  as she patrolled not far from Tinsman. Tinsman provided illumination to assist Lough in defending herself, sinking at least six of the vessels. Tinsman departed Luzon on 2 February in a convoy bound for Mindoro. Throughout February, she shuttled between Mangarin Bay and Nasugbu Bay on escort duty.\n\nEarly in March, she left Leyte Gulf, bound for New Guinea. After taking on stores at Hollandia, Tinsman returned to the Philippines and resumed escort duty. In mid-April, she made a voyage to Palau; and, in July, she varied her routine of convoy duty with visits to Ulithi and Hollandia before returning to the Philippines.\n\nAlthough the war ended in August, Tinsman remained in the Far East, operating mainly in the Philippines.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nagelfluhkette\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Nagelfluhkette is a mountain range located in Bavaria, Germany and Vorarlberg, Austria, bordering on the northern edge of the Allg\u00e4u Alps. It has a maximum altitude of 1,834 m above sea level. Its name derives from the rock type Nagelfluh. In older and geological literature, as well as in the local vernacular language, one also finds the term Hochgratkette.\n\nThe geotope Nagelfluhkette is the most extensive object of the Nagelfluhkette Nature Park, which was established on 1 January 2008.\n\nLocation \nThe Nagelfluhkette extends throughout the western part of the Allg\u00e4u Alps west of the Illertal, in which the Bavarian cities Sonthofen and Immenstadt lie. Between these cities is Blaichach, from where the mountain range stretches for about 20\u00a0km in west-southwest direction to the Vorarlberg community of Hittisau. The German-Austrian border runs along the saddle of the mountain ridge between Hohenfluhalpkopf and Hochh\u00e4derich (Hoher H\u00e4derich).\n\nThe Nagelfluhkette is one of the last higher elevations of the Alps before further north the Alpine foothills of the Allg\u00e4u begin. In the north lies the valley of the west-flowing Wei\u00dfach; in the southeast the H\u00f6rnergruppe rises beyond the valley of the northeast-flowing Aubach.\n\nNagelfluhkette Nature Park \nThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park is the first cross-border nature park to be created between Germany and Austria, thus representing an international natural protection pilot project. It also constitutes the first natural park in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nPriority objectives are the protection, care and development of nature and the diverse landscapes. Nature parks are relatively weak protection instruments, which primarily serve to harmonize the interests of nature conservation and local tourism. This part is located primarily in parts of the Bavarian Forest which are still in use, and not in the well-developed alpine area. In Vorarlberg \u2013 unlike in the other federal states of Austria \u2013 a nature park is not a legally protected area. The Nagefluhkette Nature Park is a voluntary commitment of the nature park communities themselves. Therefore, the park is (as of 5/2011) not a member of the Association of Nature Parks of Austria (VN\u00d6).\n\nSize and participating communities \n\nThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park covers 24,700 hectares in the district of Oberallg\u00e4u and 16,300 hectares in the adjacent Bregenzerwald, making a total of about 410 square kilometers. Six Oberallg\u00e4u communities and eight Vorarlberg communities joined forces for this project:\n\n Germany: Balderschwang, Blaichach, Bolsterlang, Fischen, Immenstadt, Oberstaufen, Obermaiselstein\n Austria: Doren, Hittisau, Krumbach, Langenegg, Lingenau, Riefensberg, Sibratsgf\u00e4ll, Sulzberg\n\nAdministration \n\nThe nature park administration (\"Naturpark Nagelfluhkette e.V.\") is based in B\u00fchl am Alpsee, a district of Immenstadt. On the Austrian side, the park is looked after in the community offices.\n\nTourism \nThe Nagelfluhkette is flanked by lower mountain ridges to the north and south and thus offers excellent views in almost all directions. Mountain railways are operated all year round in Mittagberg (Mittagbahn) and Hochgrat (Hochgratbahn).\n\nHiking \n\nHikes on the Kammweg chain are of the most popular in the district of Oberallg\u00e4u, thanks to the glorious views. Since all mountains are individually accessible, there is a great variety of secure walks, with only a minimum of  climbing obstacles. Some places, especially between Steineberg and Stuiben, and between Falken and Hochh\u00e4drich, are difficult and exposed, requiring a high degree of sure-footedness and a head for heights.\n\nShorter routes lead, for example, from the mountain station of the Mittagbahn over the Steineberg and Stuiben through the Steigbachtal back to Immenstadt. Another trail is the Maximiliansweg, which leads over the mountains Hochgrat, Rindalphorn, and Buralpkopf.\n\nWell-secured and -signposted medium-length tours include the crossing of the entire eastern chain from Hochgrat to the Mittag (Nagelfluh-Gratwanderung), which follows the European long-distance hiking trails E4 and E5 at this stage, and the crossing of the western chain between Hochgrat and Falken (Luftiger Grat).\n\nThe K\u00f6nigstour, an entire crossing of the Nagelfluh from Mittagberg to Hochh\u00e4drich, is doable on a single day, provided the hiker is sportive and fit (length of the tour: about 8.5 hours, including breaks). In any case, the Staufner Haus of the German Alpine Club is available as an accommodation hut.\n\nWinter sports \n\nIn addition to the mountain railways, there are ski lifts to the Einguntkopf (from Falkenh\u00fctte) and Hochh\u00e4drich, each on the snow-sure north side.\n\nSlopes for skiers are located at Mittagberg, Hochgrat, Einguntkopf and Hochh\u00e4drich in Austria. Large parts of the Nagelfluh crossing are accessible as winter hikes with snowshoes or touring skis.\n\nMountains \nThe highest mountain of the Nagelfluhkette is the Hochgrat with a height of 1,834 m.\n\nExternal links \n\n Website of the Nature Park Nagelfluhkette\n\nReferences \n\nMountain ranges of Vorarlberg\nMountain ranges of Bavaria", "machine_text": " The Nagelfluhkette is a mountain range in the Northern Limestone Alps of Germany and Austria. The range is located in the state of Bavaria in Germany and the state of Tyrol in Austria. It is a small range, about 65 km (40 mi) long and no more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide. The highest peak is the Hohe Gro\u00dfe Lindau at 8,208 ft (2,500 m). The range is named after the German word for \"nail,\" nagel, which describes the shape of the mountains, as they appear \"clipped\" along their tops. The northern part of the range is in Germany, the southern part is in Austria. The border between the two countries runs along the main crest of the range. The Nagelfluhkette is part of the Northern Limestone Alps. To the north it is bounded by the Allg\u00e4u Alps and to the south it is bounded by the Karwendel. To the east the Tannheim Mountains and the Oberallg\u00e4u Alps are the adjacent ranges. The main ridge of the Nagelfluhkette, which is the watershed between the Bavarian and Tyrolean parts of the range, consists of the following peaks: The prominent rock formation called\u00fc, located between the Vennacher Heft and the Hohe Gro\u00dfe Lindau, is the highest point of the Bavarian part of the range at 7,(), and the second highest point of the range. To the south of the main ridge the mountains are higher and become more rugged. The highest mountains of the southern part are: The Nagelfluhkette is drained by the Iller and the Isar in the west and by the Inn in the east. The Iller originates in the Allg\u00e4u Alps and flows through the valley between the Nagelfluhkette and the Allg\u00e4u Alps. It flows into the Isar in the west. The Isar originates in the Karwendel and flows through the valley between the Nagelfluhkette and the Karwendel. It flows into the Danube in the south. The Inn originates in the Austrian Inn Valley to the east of the range and flows past the eastern end of the range. It flows into the Danube north of the city of Munich. There are two large lakes in the range, the Wei\u00dfensee and the Tegernsee. The Wei\u00dfensee is located in the Austrian part of the range. It is drained by the Wei\u00dfenbach, a tributary of the Inn. The Tegernsee is located in the Bavarian part of the range. It is drained by the F\u00fcnfseenbach, a tributary of the Isar. The Nagelfluhkette is a popular destination for hiking and rock climbing. The Wei\u00dfensee and the Tegernsee are both well-known resorts. There are two via ferratas in the range. One of them is the via ferrata up to the top of the Vennacher Heft. The other one is the via ferrata over the Reiter Alm, a via ferrata which is only accessible by climbing. There are three dams in the range. The most prominent one is the Walchensee, a large reservoir which is located in the Isar valley to the west of the range. The other two are the Weisseisensee and the Tegernsee. Both are located in the Bavarian part of the range.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58240447}

Bowen House or as Bowen Cottage, is a historic house located on Route 169 in Woodstock, Connecticut, United States. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992.  It is described as one of the best-preserved and best-documented Gothic summer houses in the nation, with virtually intact interior decorations.\n\nIt is now owned by Historic New England, a non-profit organization that preserves the historical value of the house and operates it as a museum.\n\nRoseland Cottage was built in 1846 in the Gothic Revival style as the summer home of Henry Chandler Bowen and family. The entire complex, with a boxwood parterre garden, an icehouse, garden house, carriage barn, and the nation's oldest surviving indoor bowling alley, reflects the principles of writer and designer Andrew Jackson Downing. In his widely popular books, Downing stressed practicality along with the picturesque, and offered detailed instructions on room function, sanitation, and landscaping.\n\nBeginning in 1870, the largest Fourth of July celebrations in the United States were held at Roseland Cottage. Four United States Presidents visited Bowen's summer home as his guests and speakers for these celebrations: Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, and William McKinley. Other prominent visitors included Henry Ward Beecher, Julia Ward Howe, Oliver Wendell Holmes and John C. Fremont.\n\nToday the house remains in excellent historic condition, with original Gothic furniture and embossed Lincrusta Walton wall decoration. The house, known locally as The Pink House, is currently painted coral pink, and located on Woodstock Hill Common. Roseland's parterre garden contain twenty-one flowerbeds with more than 4,000 annuals bordered in boxwood, in their original 1850 pattern, and now form part of Connecticut's Historic Gardens.\n\nThe house is a contributing property within NRHP-listed Woodstock Hill Historic District.\n\nSee also\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Windham County, Connecticut\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Historic New England website\n Historic American Buildings Survey (Library of Congress) - Bowen Cottage\n\nWoodstock, Connecticut\nHistoric house museums in Connecticut\nMuseums in Windham County, Connecticut\nNational Historic Landmarks in Connecticut\nCarpenter Gothic houses in the United States\nHouses completed in 1846\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut\nHouses in Windham County, Connecticut\nNational Register of Historic Places in Windham County, Connecticut\nHistoric New England\nHistoric district contributing properties in Connecticut", "machine_text": " Roseland Cottage Roseland Cottage is a historic house museum in Woodstock, Vermont, United States.

After Rosales' death in 1900, the house was purchased by the Roseland Park Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the house and its history. The house is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture, with a three-bay front and prominent Doric columns. The house is also noted for its elaborate moldings and plasterwork, which were designed by Asher Benjamin, a noted architect of the period. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Roseland Cottage is open to the public for tours and events.

In a similar manner to American Graffiti and Scorsese's earlier Mean Streets, the songs served roughly the same purpose as a composed musical score. While an official soundtrack was released at the same time as the film, it only featured a small fraction of the songs used.\n\nScorsese chose the songs for Goodfellas only if they commented on the scene or the characters \"in an oblique way\". The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music which could have been heard at that time.\n\nScorsese decided that if a scene took place in the 1970s, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"Layla\" playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.\n\nSome of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.

The film is set in New York City during the 1960s and the 1980s and follows the story of a small-time gangster who becomes involved in murders, drug trafficking, and money laundering, and is eventually arrested and sent to prison. The film's original score was composed by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who had previously worked with Scorsese on the films Once Upon a Time in America (1984) and The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). The main theme, \"Goodfellas' Theme\", was co-composed by Morricone and Scorsese, and features a Hammond organ. The score was recorded in Rome, where Morricone was assisted by his son, Andrea. The soundtrack was first released in 1990 throughMCA Records. A second version of the soundtrack was released in 1992 through Capitol Records. The second version includes several cues that were not included on the original soundtrack, as well as an extended version of \"Goodfellas' Theme\". A third version of the soundtrack was released in 2005 through V2 Records, and includes a previously unreleased track, \"Waking Up in the Hospital\", which was originally intended for the film but not used. The soundtrack has been praised by critics, and is considered to be one of the best film scores of all time. It is known for its unique and distinctive sound, which combines elements of jazz, blues, and classical music. The main theme, \"Goodfellas' Theme\", is widely recognized as one of the most memorable and iconic film themes of all time.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17308345}

Josef Kalousek was born in 1914 in the village of Nov\u00e1 Street in the P\u0159erov district of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which is now part of the Czech Republic. He was one of six children of a baker and a housewife. In 1928, he began to study at the School of Applied Arts in P\u0159erov, and then, in 1930, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. His teachers included the painter and graphic artist Jaroslav Benda and the graphic artist and photographer Jaroslav Rossler. In addition to his studies, he worked as a photographer's assistant and as a painter of advertisements. In 1938, at the age of 24, Kalousek married his first wife, Anna, with whom he had one daughter, V\u011bra. In the same year, he joined the army and served in the military engineering corps. After the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939, he was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Poland. He was able to return to Prague in 1940, and he then worked as a photographer and photojournalist for the German press agency Transpress. In 1942, Kalousek married his second wife, V\u011bra, with whom he had two daughters, Eva and Dagmar. In the same year, he was conscripted into the German army and sent to the Eastern Front. He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad and was taken prisoner by the Soviets. He returned to Prague in May 1945, after the end of the war. In the post-war period, Kalousek worked as a graphic artist and illustrator. He was a member of the Czech-Moravian section of the Union of Visual Artists of Czechoslovakia and a member of the Association of Czech Graphic Artists. In addition to his work as an artist, he was also a passionate photographer, and he took many pictures of his family and friends, as well as of nature and the urban landscape. In 2012, at the age of 98, Kalousek was interviewed about his life and work for the Czech television program \"O\u010di, rozhod\u010d\u00ed!\" (Eyes, Judge!).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Einar Englund\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sven Einar Englund (June 17, 1916 \u2013 June 27, 1999) was a Finnish composer.\n\nLife\nSven Einar Englund was born at Ljugarn in Gotland, Sweden, on June 17, 1916; he died June 27, 1999 in Visby, Sweden. He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenb\u00f6gel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married Maynie Sir\u00e9n, a singer, with whom he had one son.\n\nOne of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music.\n\nHe went to Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren.\n \nFollowing his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life-threatening incident, with a smile.\n\nMusic\nEnglund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the \"War Symphony\". This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the \"Blackbird Symphony\", soon followed the first.\n\nIn 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man.\n\nThroughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including Sinuhe, a ballet  (1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and Odysseus (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Birgit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg\u2019s Valkoinen peura (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch\u2019s play The Great Wall of China are particularly notable.\n\nHe composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the Hymnus Sepulcralis (1975).\n\nDuring the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sir\u00e9n, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language Hufvudstadsbladet, and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982.\n\nHis Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23\u00a0years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981).\n\nEnglund\u2019s Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled Aphorisms, is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death.

His music is characterized by its technical perfection, and by the fact that it is based on the traditions of earlier Finnish music, whilst at the same time looking towards the future. As a musicologist, Englund made an important contribution to the study of Finnish music, in particular that of the Romantic era.

Initially located at a private home in Darien, Connecticut, it relocated to Stamford in 1935, and in 1963, to the neighboring town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Relocating again in Greenwich, it eventually occupied the Rosemary Hall campus from 1971 until Daycroft's closing in 1991. Smart founded the school for the children of local Christian Scientists.\n\nSchool history \nDaycroft was founded by Sarah Pyle Smart as a private school for the children of area Christian Scientists so they could be educated in an environment akin to their home life, where the teachings of Christian Science were \"an integral part\" of life. To that end, the faculty were all members of The Mother Church. Admission to the school was restricted to the children of parents who were students of Christian Science. The school had no official tie with the Christian Science Church. In later years, admission was extended to those had a close relative who was a member of The Mother Church or one of its branch churches.\n\nThe school was a member of the Secondary Education Board and offered pre-school through high school, in general subjects and college preparatory education. The school offered partial scholarships and was incorporated in 1939 as a non-profit institution.\n\nThe school's initial home was in Darien, Connecticut, where the Smarts lived. In 1935, a portion of an estate was purchased on Noroton Hill, near the  Stamford Cove and became the new home for the school. The 46-acre Stamford campus was sold to Clairol in 1963, when the school moved to the Rock Ridge area of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1971, the school moved to the former Rosemary Hall campus, also in Rock Ridge. In 1998, the campus was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its architectural significance. Its chapel was designed in the Middle English Gothic style by Theodore E. Blake of Carr\u00e8re & Hastings.\n\nPolio outbreak \nIn 1972, the Daycroft school was one of the last sites of a polio outbreak in the United States. Due to their Christian Science belief, very few students at the school were immunized for polio. The outbreak prompted an emergency quarantine and mass immunization, which successfully prevented polio from spreading to the rest of the state. Ultimately, at least 11 school children (9 boys and 2 girls) were stricken by the paralytic form of the disease.\n\nNotable alumni and staff \nRichard Bergenheim\nJacqueline Moss\nZack Snyder\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDaycroft School Foundation\nCS e-News Spotlight\n\nSchools in Fairfield County, Connecticut\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nChristian Science in the United States\nChristian Science in Connecticut\nFormer Christian Science churches, societies and buildings in the United States\nEducational institutions established in 1928\n1928 establishments in Connecticut", "machine_text": " Daycroft School is a co-ed, independent day school for students in Kindergarten through Grade 8.

The school is divided into three divisions: the Lower School (K-4), the Middle School (5-6), and the Upper School (7-8). In the Lower School, students experience a rich and rigorous academic program, with specialists in science, physical education, art, music, and Spanish.

These terms were originally coined by Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985).\n\nTo see what is meant by 'reinforce' or 'offset', consider a situation in which the players all have similar choices to make, as in the paper of Bulow et al., where the players are all imperfectly competitive firms that must each decide how much to produce. Then the production decisions are strategic complements if an increase in the production of one firm increases the marginal revenues of the others, because that gives the others an incentive to produce more too. This tends to be the case if there are sufficiently strong aggregate increasing returns to scale and/or the demand curves for the firms' products have a sufficiently low own-price elasticity. On the other hand, the production decisions are strategic substitutes if an increase in one firm's output decreases the marginal revenues of the others, giving them an incentive to produce less.\n\nAccording to Russell Cooper and Andrew John, strategic complementarity is the basic property underlying examples of multiple equilibria in coordination games.\n\nCalculus formulation\nMathematically, consider a symmetric game with two players that each have payoff function , where  represents the player's own decision, and  represents the decision of the other player.

It was released on 31 October 2019, through Garrix's Netherlands-based record label Stmpd Rcrds, and exclusively licensed to Epic Amsterdam, a division of Sony Music. The remixes pack was released on 20 December 2019 and an acoustic version on 14 February 2020.\n\nThe song was nominated for Most Performed Australian Work and Most Performed Dance Work at the APRA Music Awards of 2021\n\nBackground \nIn May 2019, when Garrix injured his ankle, his doctors ordered him to take two weeks off before resuming his tour.\nAfter his surgery, his friend and co-producer Albin Nedler visited him at the hospital. At that time the DJ confessed to him that he was writing the song from afar with Dean Lewis. A few days later, the singer came to Amsterdam, Netherlands to finish writing it and start recording it. When he arrived on 17 June, Garrix and Lewis shared their meeting with their fans by posting a photo of themselves on Instagram. It showed them in a short boat hanging out by the water canals in Amsterdam and was accompanied by the comment \"I live for days like this!\" left by Garrix. In the studio, Lewis played the role of singer and guitarist. He had just finished a long tour that injured his voice, which led him to save it for the second day of recordings and start by recording his guitar parts. He later claimed that the chorus of \"Used to Love\" is one of the highest vocal lines and that the single is one of the most challenging ones he has worked on. When he recorded his vocals he was led to make several attempts to get the right vocal balance and the right notes without forcing his voice. During the following months, both artists were busy creating new music in Garrix's studio based in Amsterdam. Then, from 7 to 8 September was taking place Garrix's fifth anniversary of Lollapalooza Berlin. It was at this time that the DJ officially revealed that the song was set to be released at the end of October. To accompany his announcement, he added, \"This track was made during my break while I was recovering from my ankle injury. Dean and I are super excited to share it with the world!\" On 25 October, he posted via his social media the cover of the song, unveiling its release date. After the release, Dean Lewis talked about his collaboration, saying:\n\nGarrix felt it was amazing to make the song with Lewis, who he considers as \"a good friend and an exciting talent\". He added that the singer wrote deeply personal lyrics accompanied by a timeless style of music during the development of the track.\n\nCritical reception \nKatie Bain of Billboard wrote that Garrix and Lewis paid homage to American singer Bruce Springsteen with the lyrics \"we had Springsteen playing so loud\" in their track. She felt the song swelling and compelling \"in the same style as many of Springsteen's biggest and most grandiose hits\", noting that \"Lewis' soaring vocals add to the effect\" and that \"all these elements making yet another bonafide smash from the EDM hitmaker\". Writing for Dancing Astronaut, Farrell Sweeney noted the presence of \"an energy-building violin line and acoustic elements\" resulting from a song \"vocal-led by Lewis's impassioned vocals, while Garrix foregoes a heavy electronic emphasis, trading it in for a subtle production backdrop accented with acoustics\". Mike Wass of Idolator deemed the song \"an emotional banger\" and \"a duo's genre-blurring bop\", containing Dean Lewis vocals \"over piano keys and strummed guitar\". Writing for Your EDM, Matthew Meadow said that the track is \"usual Garrix fare, with some quaint vocal chops in the drop and a non-intrusive melody\". According to him, the singer voice \"never really stands out from the production, which itself never really reaches any sort of crescendo\". He also spotted similarities with Martin Garrix previous songs, such as \"No Sleep\" or \"There for You\", but noted that \"Used to Love\" showed off \"a more mellow side to his sound, rather than the firework-inducing main stage bangers most people know him for\". In an article written later he remarked that releasing the single on Halloween day was \"a bit of an odd choice for such an uplifting song as this\". Phil Scilippa of EDM.com noted that the song \"retains an optimistic vibe, while the lyrics themselves are quite nostalgic and sad\". He called the single \"a future bass inspired sound\" endowed with \"an uplifting vivacity\" thanks to \"Lewis' piano parts and vocals\" which \"are the cherry on top\" and giving to the song \"a bright and summery feeling\".\n\nMusic video \nThe official music video of the song was released at the same day through Martin Garrix's YouTube channel.

The track is built around Arthur's vocals, which were recorded for a previous, unfinished collaboration. Mack and Martin received a songwriting credit after Garrix and Lewis used the same lyrics and melody. The song is additionally produced by Garrix, Lewis, and Mack. \"Used to Love\" was released via Garrix's Dutch record label Stmpd Rcrds, which is under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment.

Moonhole derives its name from a massive arch formed in volcanic substrate through which the setting moon is sometimes visible.\n\nFounded by Thomas and Gladys Johnston in the 1960s, Moonhole is now a private nature preserve. In the late 1960s, the Johnstons retired from an advertising business in New York and founded the Moonhole community on the narrow western tip of the island.  Tom and Gladys began building a house beneath the arch with the aid of local masons from the nearby village of Paget Farm. Using whalebones, native hardwoods, and objects recovered from the sea, they built large open rooms with sea views. Without wells or electricity, they collected rainwater from the roofs and stored it in cisterns for bathing and washing. The master bath had a large tree that grew right up through a large hole in the roof. Large windows facing the prevailing trade winds had plexiglass panes that could be lowered into place. The bedrooms surrounded a central dining room, veranda and large bar made from a humpback whale's jaw bone.  In the early years there was not even a road to Moonhole. People from Paget Farm walked in daily to bring in fresh fruit and freshly baked bread and to do any necessary cooking.\n\nTom and Gladdie later formed Moonhole Company Limited and contributed the approximately  property to the company. Tom bequeathed his controlling interest in Moonhole Company Limited to a trust for the protection and preservation of Moonhole for posterity.  The Thomas and Gladys Johnston Moonhole Conservation Trust Limited is dedicated to preserving the unique architecture, lifestyle, and vision of the Johnstons and to protecting the birds, wildlife and marine life on the peninsula at the western end of Bequia. There are now eleven privately owned homes at Moonhole and four houses owned by Moonhole Company Limited. Some of these properties are available for rent throughout the year. \n\nIn 2004 the New York Times described Moonhole as \"a quirky 19-home ecologically oriented development built of native stone, with whalebone accents, on the steep hills of the island's southern tip. The name comes from a soaring natural arch on the shore through which the moon can be seen at times. The whalebones, remnants of aboriginal whaling by the islanders, are big enough to work as elements like stair railings. The houses, which rely on solar electricity, rainwater and propane tanks, are mostly fanciful open-air affairs with lines blurred between indoors and out.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Moonhole Company Website\n Sports Illustrated interview\n New York Times feature (2004)\n New York Times feature (1975)\nDu Jour Magazine (2013)\n\nPopulated places in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nHouses in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines", "machine_text": " Moonhole is a small private island and resort in the Atlantic Ocean, located about 30 miles (48 km) from the eastern tip of the island of Barbados.

The island's two white-sand beaches are referred to as the \"Sunrise Beach\" and the \"Sunset Beach\". The resort has been compared to a \"castaway\" or \"pirates of the Caribbean\" experience, with guests being greeted at the airport in Barbados and then taken by boat to the island.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maurice Maeterlinck\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (29 August 1862 \u2013 6 May 1949), also known as Count (or Comte) Maeterlinck from 1932, was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist who was Flemish but wrote in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 \"in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations\". The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. He was a leading member of La Jeune Belgique group and his plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement. In later life, Maeterlinck faced credible accusations of plagiarism.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nMaeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His mother, Mathilde Colette Fran\u00e7oise (n\u00e9e Van den Bossche), came from a wealthy family. His father, Polydore, was a notary who enjoyed tending the greenhouses on their property.\n\nIn September 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion. One of his companions at that time was the writer Charles van Lerberghe, the poems and plays of whom went on to act as mutual influences on each other at the start of the Symbolist period.\n\nMaeterlinck had written poems and short novels while still studying, but his father wanted him to go into law. After gaining a law degree at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met members of the new Symbolist movement; Villiers de l'Isle Adam in particular, who would have a great influence on Maeterlinck's subsequent work.\n\nCareer\n\nMaeterlinck instantly became a public figure when his first play, Princess Maleine, received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of Le Figaro, in August 1890. In the following years he wrote a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most importantly Intruder (1890), The Blind (1890) and Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande (1892).\n\nHe had a relationship with the singer and actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 until 1918. Leblanc influenced his work for the following two decades. With the play Aglavaine and S\u00e9lysette (1896) Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, who were more in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout his career, Maeterlinck slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style.\n\nIn 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish husband. The couple frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean Lorrain, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this period, Maeterlinck published his Twelve Songs (1896), The Treasure of the Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariadne and Bluebeard (1902).\n\nIn 1903 Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government. During this period, and up until the Great War of 1914-1918, he was widely looked up to, throughout Europe, as a great sage, and the embodiment of the higher thought of the time.\n\nIn 1906 Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse in the south of France. He spent his hours meditating and walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the  Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. By renting the abbey he rescued it from the desecration of being sold and used as a chemical factory and thus he received a blessing from the Pope. Leblanc would often walk around in the garb of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the house. During this time, he wrote his essay \"The Intelligence of Flowers\" (1906), in which he expressed sympathy with socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary success: the fairy play  The Blue Bird (1908, but largely written in 1906). After the writing \"The Intelligence of Flowers\", he suffered from a period of depression and writer's block. Although he recovered from this after a year or two, he never became so inventive as a writer again. His later plays, such as Marie-Victoire (1907) and  Mary Magdalene (1910), provided with lead roles for Leblanc, were notably inferior to their predecessors, and sometimes merely repeat an earlier formula. Even though alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of his mother on 11 June 1910 added to his depression.\n\nIn 1910 he met the 18-year-old actress Ren\u00e9e Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. She became his lighthearted companion. After having been nominated by Carl Bildt, a member of the Swedish Academy, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911, which also served to lighten his spirits. By 1913 he had become more openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the Catholic party during a strike. He began to study mysticism and lambasted the Catholic Church in his essays for misconstruing the history of the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, the Roman Catholic Church placed his opera omnia on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlinck wished to join the French Foreign Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people and placed the blame upon all Germans for the war. Although his patriotism and his indifference to the harm he was doing to his standing in Germany do him credit, his reputation as a great sage who stood above current affairs was damaged by his political involvement. \nWhile in Nice he wrote The Mayor of Stilmonde (1918), which the American press quickly labeled a \"Great War Play\", and which became a British film in 1929. He also wrote The Betrothal (, 1922), a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.\n\nOn 15 February 1919 Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States, where Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of them. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of the Bee. After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, exclaiming: \"My God! The hero is a bee!\"\n\nAfter 1920 Maeterlinck ceased to contribute significantly to the theatre, but continued to produce essays on his favourite themes of occultism, ethics and natural history. The international demand for these fell off sharply after the early 1920s, but his sales in France remained substantial until the late 1930s. Dahon gave birth to a stillborn child in 1925.\n\nPlagiarism\nIn 1926 Maeterlinck published La Vie des Termites (translated into English as The Life of Termites or The Life of  White Ants), an entomological book that plagiarised the book The Soul of the (White) Ant, by the Afrikaner poet and scientist Eug\u00e8ne Marais, David Bignell, in his inaugural address as Professor of Zoology at the University of London (2003), called Maeterlinck's work \"a classic example of academic plagiarism\".\nMarais accused Maeterlinck of having appropriated Marais' concept of the \"organic unity\" of the termite nest in his book. Marais had published his ideas on termite nests in the South African Afrikaans-language press, in Die Burger (January 1923) and in Huisgenoot, which featured a series of articles on termites under the title \"Die Siel van die Mier\" (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is conjectured that Maeterlinck had come across Marais' articles while writing his book, and that it would have been easy for him to translate Afrikaans into French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French.  It was common at the time, moreover, for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.\n\nMarais wrote in a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck that\n\nThe famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work ... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.\n\nSupported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. All the same, he gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: \"I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?\"\n\nMaeterlinck's own words in The Life of Termites indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:\n\nIt would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.\n\nWhatever Maeterlinck's misgivings at the time of writing, the bibliography he refers to does not include Eug\u00e8ne Marais. \n\nProfessor V. E. d'Assonville referred to Maeterlinck as \"the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg\".\n\nRobert Ardrey, an admirer of Eug\u00e8ne Marais, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck, although Marais' biographer, Leon Rousseau, suggested that Marais had enjoyed and even thrived on the controversy the attention it generated.\n\nAnother allegation of plagiarism concerned Maeterlinck's play Monna Vanna, which was said to have been based on Robert Browning's little-known play Luria.\n\nLater life\nIn 1930 he bought a ch\u00e2teau in Nice, France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze Chansons.\n\nHe was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932.\n\nAccording to an article published in the New York Times in 1940, he arrived in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner Nea Hellas. He had fled to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. While in Portugal, he stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel, between 27 July and 17 August 1939. The Times quoted him as saying, \"I knew that if I was captured by the Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an enemy of Germany because of my play, The Mayor of Stilmonde, which dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.\" As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, friendly and Francophilic for his taste.\n\nHe returned to Nice after the war on 10 August 1947. He was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers, from 1947 until 1949. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the French Language. He died in Nice on 6 May 1949 after suffering a heart attack.\n\nHonours \n 1920: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold.\n 1932: Created Count Maeterlinck, by Royal Decree. However, he neglected fulfilling the necessary paper work for registration and the creation was not implemented.\n\nStatic drama\n\nMaeterlinck's posthumous reputation depends entirely on his early plays (published between 1889 and 1894), which created a new style of dialogue, extremely lean and spare, where what is suggested is more important than what is said. The characters have no foresight, and only a limited understanding of themselves or the world around them. That the characters stumble into tragedy without realizing where they are going may suggest that Maeterlinck thought of man as powerless against the forces of fate, but the kinship is not with ancient Greek tragedy but with modern dramatists such as Beckett and Pinter who bring out human vulnerability in a world beyond our comprehension.  \n\nMaeterlinck believed that any actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that marionettes were an excellent alternative. Guided by strings operated by a puppeteer, Maeterlinck considered marionettes an excellent representation of fate's complete control over man. He wrote Interior, The Death of Tintagiles, and Alladine and Palomides for marionette theatre.\n\nFrom this, he gradually developed his notion of the \"static drama.\" He felt that it was the artist's responsibility to create something that did not express human emotions but rather the external forces that compel people. Maeterlinck once wrote that \"the stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. ... Poems die when living people get into them.\"\n\nHe explained his ideas on the static drama in his essay \"The Tragic in Daily Life\" (1896), which appeared in The Treasure of the Humble. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by an external force, fate as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often continue to refer to his cast of characters as \"marionettes.\"\n\nMaeterlinck's conception of modern tragedy rejects the intrigue and vivid external action of traditional drama in favour of a dramatisation of different aspects of life:\n\nHe cites a number of classical Athenian tragedies\u2014which, he argues, are almost motionless and which diminish psychological action to pursue an interest in \"the individual, face to face with the universe\"\u2014as precedents for his conception of static drama; these include most of the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles' Ajax, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus, and Philoctetes. With these plays, he claims:\n\nMaeterlinck in music\n\nPell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande inspired several musical compositions at the turn of the 20th century:\n 1897: a suite for orchestra by William Wallace: Pelleas and Melisande\n 1898: an orchestral suite (sometimes described as incidental music) by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 See: Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Faur\u00e9) (Op. 80)\n 1893\u20131902: an opera by Claude Debussy (L. 88, Paris), see Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)\n 1902\u20131903: a symphonic poem by Arnold Schoenberg (Op. 5)\n 1905: incidental music by Jean Sibelius (Op. 46), see Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Sibelius)\n\nOther musical works based on Maeterlinck's plays include:\n\n Aglavaine and S\u00e9lysette\n orchestral prelude by Arthur Honegger\n orchestral overture by Cyril Scott\n Aladina and Palomid\n opera by Burghauser\n opera by Osvald Chlubna\n opera by Emil Franti\u0161ek Burian\n Ariane et Barbe-bleue\n opera in 3 acts by Paul Dukas\n incidental music by Anatoly Nikolayevich Alexandrov\n The Betrothal\n incidental music by Armstrong Gibbs\n The Blind\n opera by Beat Furrer\n chamber opera \u015alepcy by Polish composer Jan Astriab after Maeterlinck's Les aveugles\n opera by Lera Auerbach\n The Death of Tintagiles\n symphonic poem by Charles Martin Loeffler\n incidental music by Ralph Vaughan Williams\n opera by Lawrance Collingwood\n overture by Carse\n opera by Nougues\n symphonic poem by Santoliquido\n orchestral prelude by Voormolen\n Herzgew\u00e4chse (Foliages of the Heart)\n Lied for soprano with small ensemble by Arnold Schoenberg\n Monna Vanna\n opera in 3 acts by Emil \u00c1br\u00e1nyi\n Monna Vanna, opera in 4 acts by Henry F\u00e9vrier\n Monna Vanna, unfinished opera by Sergei Rachmaninoff\n opera in 4 acts by Nicolae Br\u00e2nzeu\n L'oiseau bleu\n opera by Albert Wolff\n 13 scenes for orchestra by Fritz Hart\n incidental music by Leslie Heward\n incidental music by Engelbert Humperdinck\n overture by Kricka\n incidental music by Norman O'Neill\n incidental music by Szeligowski\n Princess Maleine\n overture by Pierre de Br\u00e9ville\n overture by Cyril Scott\n unfinished opera (or incidental music) by Lili Boulanger\n incidental music by Maximilian Steinberg\n The Seven Princesses\n incidental music by Pierre de Br\u00e9ville\n opera by Vassili Vassilievitch Netcha\u00efev\n S\u0153ur Beatrice\n opera by Alexander Grechaninov\n chorus by Anatoly Liadov\n opera Sor Beatriz by Marquez Puig\n opera by Dmitri Mitropoulos\n opera by Rasse (composer)\n Int\u00e9rieur\n opera by Giedrius Kuprevi\u010dius\n\nWorks\n\nPoetry\n Serres chaudes (1889)\n Douze chansons (1896)\n Quinze chansons (expanded version of Douze chansons) (1900)\n\nDrama\n La Princesse Maleine (Princess Maleine) (published 1889)\n L'Intruse (Intruder) (published 1890;

He was also a professor of French literature at the University of Ghent, a Belgian army officer, and a culture minister. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, the son of a printer and a housewife. He studied at the Ghent Municipal Technical School, and then at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels. He served for seven years in the Belgian army, reaching the rank of captain. After a short stint in the customs service, he studied literature and philosophy at the University of Ghent, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy in 1891. His thesis, Le r\u00e8gne de Diderot, was published the following year. In 1892 he became a professor of French literature at the University of Ghent, and in 1895 he married the pianist and composer Lily el Korea (1871\u20131919). In his first important work, La Morale en Politique (1893), Maeterlinck attacked the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and the Egoism of Max Stirner. He argued instead for a return to the old Christian virtues. In a famous passage, he asserted that \"God is dead, and we have killed him, we who have taken from him the rhyme and the measure.\" In the plays that made him famous, Maeterlinck depicted the fate of the individual in a world subject to natural forces beyond human control. The heroes of these plays are isolated figures in an indifferent universe, attempting to find their own way and to assert their own will in the face of hostile or uncertain forces. In the best known of these plays, L'Intruse (The Intruder, 1897), a maniacal murderer is on the loose. The hero's family is threatened, and the hero himself becomes obsessed by the idea that he may be the murderer. In the end, the murderer is revealed to be a neighbor, but the hero's own fear and doubt have destroyed his life. In the plays that followed, such as Les Aveugles (The Blind, 1898), La Mort de Tintagiles (The Death of Tintagiles, 1900), and Le R\u00e8gne du Mal (The Kingdom of Evil, 1901), the author continued to explore the theme of the isolation of the individual. His characters seek to understand their place in the universe and to find meaning in their lives. In Le R\u00e8gne du Mal especially, Maeterlinck seems to have been influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly by the idea that the world is divided into the forces of light and the forces of darkness, with the hero alone standing between the two. In the first decade of the 20th century, Maeterlinck's reputation as a dramatist was at its height. His plays were performed in the leading theaters of Europe and America, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911. His works of the period include La Gazelle (The Gazelle, 1900), La Source (The Source, 1901), Le Voyage d'Ulysse (The Voyage of Ulysses, 1904), and Int\u00e9rieur ( Interiors, 1911). After World War I, during which he served as a culture minister in the Belgian government in exile, Maeterlinck's popularity began to wane. In the 1920s and 1930s he was largely ignored, though he continued to write until his death in 1949. In his later works, such as La Course du Fortune (The Way of the World, 1928), he seems to have been influenced by the Surrealists, with their emphasis on the subconscious and the dream world. Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"in appreciation of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a noble style, a deep moral insight, and a true patriotism.\"", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 162198}

She also has a two-foot deep stub keel in place of a swing keel, which adds 10\" to her minimum draft. That in combination with her 2,300 lb. weight (versus 2,150 for the Montego 19) makes her less easily trailered than the Montego 19 ...

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harbour Solutions\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harbour Solutions is a Canadian public infrastructure project in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe CAD $333 million project comprised the construction of three sewage treatment plants and connected various sewage pipe networks with lift stations to treat all sanitary sewage in Halifax and Dartmouth. It was completed in 2010.\n\nHistory\nFor two and a half centuries prior to this project, raw sewage was discharged untreated directly into Halifax Harbour.  The harbour waters have been the recipient of approximately 200 million litres of untreated raw sewage every day, enough to fill 25 Olympic-size swimming pools. Shellfish harvesting from the harbour and swimming within the harbour have been prohibited for health reasons.\n\nThe historic settlements of Halifax and Dartmouth were built with no thought to sewage treatment as a means of waste disposal. Throughout the 19th century, sewers were designed as a single system, with no separation between sanitary sewers, which carried domestic human waste, and stormwater drainage systems. The combined sewers simply emptied into the harbour from dozens of outfalls at the bottom of each street that met the waterfront.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, it was clear that the system was not environmentally sustainable. Millions of litres of sewage were dumped into the harbour daily, consisting not only of simple human waste, but of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, and a host of other harmful material.\n\nSewage treatment plants were proposed for both Halifax and Dartmouth beginning in the 1970s, however, the separate municipalities were never able to reach a consensus for system design and construction.  That decade saw the Halifax Regional Water Commission begin to charge its customers a pollution surcharge which was intended to fund such a system.  Meanwhile, a host of different provincial and federal governments came and went and overall funding was never finalized.  It was only following municipal amalgamation which saw the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth dissolved and merged with all municipalities in Halifax County to form the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996 that the sewage treatment issue gained necessary traction and moved beyond the planning stage.\n\nCurrent project\nUnder the Harbour Solutions Project, a treatment system has been under construction since the early 2000s with three plants being built (one in downtown Halifax, one in downtown Dartmouth, and one in Herring Cove on the southwest side of the harbour) as well as extensive collector piping to close all sewage outfalls into the harbour and redirect sewage into the treatment plants.  Total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately CA$333 million. \nOn February 11, 2008, the treatment facility in downtown Halifax officially commenced operation. The Dartmouth plant came online on July 10, 2008 and the Herring Cove plant was expected to open in late fall 2008.\n\nHarbour sewage is also mitigated to a lesser extent by the aforementioned existing plants at Mill Cove, in Bedford and another at Eastern Passage.\n\nResults\nThe Halifax Regional Municipality announced on July 9, 2008 that the harbour beaches, Black Rock Beach at Point Pleasant Park and the beach at Dingle Park would re-open to swimming on August 2, 2008.  Fecal coliform bacteria levels at these locations were either undetectable or at safe levels for swimming. Eleven lifeguards would patrol the beaches.\nThe improved water quality in Halifax Harbour during the summer of 2008 was a direct result of the newly operating Halifax and Dartmouth sewage plants.  The clarity of the water improved to the point where the municipal government hired commercial divers to remove debris from the floor of the harbour along the popular boardwalk in the Historic Properties; prior to that summer, the debris was seldom visible due to the opaque water as a result of the untreated sewage.\n\n2009 breakdown\nHowever repeated breakdowns of the system in 2008 resulted in regular beach closures again and complaints about foul odours and sewage filled basements. A massive failure of the central plant in January 2009 caused raw sewage to again be poured into the Harbour.\n\nThe 2009 breakdown was caused by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called \"a perfect storm\" of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant, but the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's \"wet well\" from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, only one of the four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the electrical junction boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.\n\nThe incident brought criticism from the federal government and the public, and city officials promised to get the plant back online by Spring 2010. On June 25, 2010, the Halifax Wastewater Treatment Plant was returned to full operation, and it was announced that Black Rock Beach and Dingle Park Beach would be safe for swimming again.\n\nSewage discharged\nUntreated sewage continues to be discharged into Halifax harbour due to severed sewer lines during construction of the new treatment plant.\n\nSee also\n Saint John, New Brunswick harbour cleanup\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Harbour Solutions\n\nBuildings and structures in Halifax, Nova Scotia\nEnvironment of Canada\nHealth in Canada\nHistory of Halifax, Nova Scotia\nSewage treatment plants in Canada\nWater supply and sanitation in Canada", "machine_text": " Harbour Solutions Harbour Solutions is a company providing harbour management, ferry operations, and stevedoring services.

The population was 415 at the 2010 census.\n\nInterstate 35, County Road 43, and County 61 (Cross Street) are three of the main routes in the community.\n\nHistory \nThe first known settlement in what was to become the Village of Willow River, at the junctions of the Willow and Kettle Rivers, was an encampment of Indigenous Ojibwe peoples.\n\nIn July 1850, a roadway connecting the upper Mississippi River and the Lake Superior country, named the Point Douglas to St. Louis River Road, and more commonly known as the government military road, went from just south of St. Paul to Duluth. Willow River was chosen as a changing station for the coach horses.\n\nIn 1861 the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was organized with the financial help of Jay Cooke. It was only in August 1879 that the completed line from St. Paul to Duluth was opened. The railroad helped settle and promote living in the northern part of Minnesota. The railroad also promoted the lumber industry. Many towns and villages, including Willow River, were organized once a lumber company set up shop.\n\nIn March 1874, the Kettle River Township was organized and Willow River at this time consisted of a railroad depot, water tank, wood yard, and two section houses built for the railroad hands.\n\nPine County records show that the three sections of land that would eventually make up the village of Willow River were homesteaded by Edward Clough, Albert Kinney, Peter Jarvis, Joseph Nebula, and Richard Abbott. In 1886, Abbott sold his section of land to the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company. In 1888, Jarvis sold his section to Fox-Wisdom. In the spring of 1890, Warren D. Fox and John Wisdom opened the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company in Willow River. The company then platted the land to build their business and offer lots for employees. By 1895, Kinney had leased his land to Fox-Wisdom, and Clough had sold all but 80 acres of his section in the northern part of the village. Joseph Nebula's section was past the lake and likely unusable to the company.\n\nThe Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company sawmill was constructed and opened in March 1890. It was located on the south side of the present day Willow River dam. To ease the flow of logs, dams were built along the river to store water. There were as least three built and maintained by Fox-Wisdom. They were known as the \"Mile and a Half,\" the \"Willow Lake,\" and the \"Oak Lake\" dams. Sawmill operations began in the early spring and continued until the freeze-up of the mill pond. The mill produced lumber, lath, and shingles employing about 125 men. The mill cut 125,000 feet of lumber per day during their peak season. Many who worked in the logging camps during the winter came to the mill to work in the spring.\n\nOn May 8, 1891, the village plat was filed in Pine County. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company and its employees made up the majority of property owners. Willow River, like many other villages in northern Minnesota, owed its existence to the lumber industry. In November 1891, Willow River was incorporated as a village by a vote of 37 to 18 in the upstairs hall of the Fox-Wisdom Company store.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water.\n\nDemographics\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 415 people, 173 households, and 103 families residing in the city.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Meade Conflict\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Meade Conflict refers to a dilemma where an economy faces conflict between its internal and external balances. The phenomenon was proposed by the British economist and Nobel Prize Laurent James Meade in his influential book The Theory of International Economic PolicyThe Balance of Payments (1951). Trevor Swan developed this problem into Swan diagram, which became more influential in the economic theory. The discovery has also led to other models such as Tinbergen's Rule.\n\nAnalysis \nAccording to Meade's analysis, a country can find itself in the following four circumstances:\n\nThe problems in cases (a) and (b) can be solved using economic policies. Case (a) requires a expansionary fiscal and monetary policies that will reduce the surplus and spur recovery from the recession, while case (b) is the circumstance vice versa.\n\nHowever, in case (c), if the government and central bank of the country tries to restore payment equilibrium by expansionary policies, these measures will worsen inflation. The other alternative of tight fiscal and monetary policies means reduced inflation, but also worsen the surplus in payments. In the similar dilemma of case (d), the deficit implies that tight monetary and fiscal policies should be used, which worsens the country's recession, while the expansionary policies that will end the recession would worsen the payments deficit. Cases (c) and (d) are known as the Meade Conflict.\n\nInfluences \nThe phenomenon draws wide attention in China as the country was going through such circumstances in 2007 and 2018. The term has become more popular in Chinese news and literature than in some English-speaking countries.\n\nReferences \n\nMacroeconomics", "machine_text": " Meade Conflict The Meade Conflict was a political and military confrontation in the American Civil War, fought on the afternoon and evening of July 1, 1863, between the United States Army, under the command of General Robert E. Lee, and the forces of the Union Army, under the command of General George Meade. After four bloody days of heavy fighting, the armies met in a major engagement on the roads and fields of a small Pennsylvania town, resulting in over 51,000 casualties. Following the defeat of Union forces at Chancellorsville, Virginia, in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North\u2014the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Meade's Army of the Potomac followed Lee, seeking an opportunity to come to grips with the Confederate forces. Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brigadier General John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union cavalry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, and sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south. On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines. On the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle, the most costly in US history. On November 19, President Abraham Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the Gettysburg National Cemetery to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address.

Budd was an Olympic athlete who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where he finished fifth in the finals of the 100 meter event and was part of the team that finished first in the 4\u00d7100 meter relay before being disqualified on a baton pass.  He set the world record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.2 seconds in 1961, breaking the record that had been set by Mel Patton in 1948.\n\nEarly life \nBudd was born in Long Branch, New Jersey.  He played high school football at Asbury Park High School in Asbury Park.\n\nHe ran track at Villanova University but never played a down of college football. At Villanova he was coached by their legendary track coach James 'Jumbo' Elliott.\n\nAmazingly. Budd achieved his success despite a deformed right calf, the legacy of a childhood disease, possibly polio.\n\nTrack career \n\nBudd was considered the world's best 100 y/m sprinter in 1961. That year, he was to equal the world record for 100 y at 9.3 s, set a new world record at 9.2 s for that distance, and was a member of a team that set a world record in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s.\n\n1960 Rome Olympics \n\nBudd had finished second behind Ray Norton in the United States Olympic trials at 100 m in a closely fought contest between the first four finishers, all recording the same time of 10.4 s. At the Olympics themselves, Budd was to finish fifth in the final with perhaps his inexperience at major championships telling against him.\n\nBudd was to experience further disappointment in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. The United States team (of Budd-Norton-Stone Johnson-Dave Sime) finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because the at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. The West German team who finished second in 39.5 s received the gold medals and became the new world record holders.\n\nWorld records \n\nIn 1961, Budd was to equal twice the then world record for 100 y of 9.3 s:\n\n on 6 May in Villanova;\n on June 11 in Villanova (Note: this time was never ratified.)\n\nThis record had stood since 1948 having first been set by Mel Patton and subsequently equaled by 12 other athletes.\n\nThen on June 24, 1961, Budd became the first man to run the 100 y in 9.2 s. He was competing in the AAU Championships at Downing Stadium in New York City.\n\nOn July 15, 1961, in a dual USA-USSR meet, Budd was a member of team that set a new world record for the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s. It is claimed that Budd, feeing a twinge in a muscle, was easing-up the last 70 m.\n\nRankings \n\nBudd was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events during the period 1960\u201362, according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.\n\nUSA Championships \nBudd achieved notable success at the AAU championships, the USA national championships.\n\nAmerican football career \n\nBudd was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 1962 NFL Draft and played for the Eagles in 1962 as a wide receiver. He played for the Washington Redskins in 1963 before switching to the Canadian Football League, where he played for the Calgary Stampeders in 1965 and 1966.\n\nBudd had both sporting and financial reasons for giving up the chance of further glory on the track for the possibility of glory and wealth on the football field; as his wife, Barbera, has stated, \"...you've got to remember that Frank loved football, too,....He didn't think it was a mistake at all. There was no money available then in track.  He'd been a terrific player at Asbury Park, and he thought, with all his speed (despite no college football experience), he'd have a long career in the NFL.\".\n\nHonors \nIn 1995, Budd was one of the seven former Villanova athletes chosen to be a member of the first induction class of the Villanova Wall of Fame.\n\nLater life \n\nBudd has been reported to have worked in later life for the New Jersey Department of Corrections and retired in 2002.\n\nA resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Budd died on April 29, 2014, in the Marlton section of Evesham Township, New Jersey.

She was a member of the United States national team from 1997 to 2000, and competed on the University of California, Los Angeles intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003. She was an alternate for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nGymnastics career\n\nPre-elite \nBeckerman began training in gymnastics in 1986, when she was five years old.\n\nElite career \nIn 1996, Beckerman placed twenty-fifth in the all-around junior division at the Coca-Cola National Championships. In 1997, Beckerman became a senior competitor and a member of the United States national team. She competed at the 1997 US Classic and placed ninth in the all-around. She also competed at the 1997 John Hancock US Gymnastics Championships, placing twentieth in the all-around.\n\nIn 1998, Beckerman moved from New Jersey to Ohio to train with coach Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy. Tracy trained Beckerman for up to ten hours per day, and kept Beckerman on a restrictive diet of under 1100 calories per day. According to Beckerman, Tracy \"controlled every element, in and out of the gym\" creating a competitive culture of anxiety and silence.\n\nBeckerman was a silver medalist on bars at the 1998 US National Championships and placed second in the all-around at the 1998 Ecoair Gymnastics Cup. Beckerman was third on bars and fourth in the all-around at the 1999 US National Championships. She was third in the all around at the 1999 American Classic and a team silver medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games. She took third in the all-around at the 1999 World Championships trials and was named to the 1999 US World Championships team but was unable to compete due to a broken wrist.  Beckerman won the all-around and team competition at the 2000 Spieth Sogipa. She was first on balance beam, second on bars and fifth in the all-around at the 2000 US National Championships. She was named an alternate member of the 2000 US Olympic team, but did not compete because fellow alternate Tasha Schwikert was selected instead to replace injured team member Morgan White.\n\nBy the end of Beckerman's elite career, she had suffered nine broken bones, undergone two surgeries, and developed bleeding ulcers from overuse of anti-inflammatory drugs. During her career, she also suffered from disordered eating. During her elite career, her favorite event was uneven bars.\n\nIntercollegiate career \nBeckerman competed on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003 while pursuing a degree in sociology.  In 2001, Beckerman was limited to three competitions due to a wrist injury. She placed second and recorded a score of 9.875 on balance beam at Arizona State, as well as placing fifth on balance beam with a score of 9.8 at the UCLA Invitational. She earned NACGC Scholastic All-America honors that year. During the 2002 season, Beckerman was UCLA's anchor on balance beam, averaging 9.77 over the year and winning individually six times.  She was NCAA South Central Regional balance beam champion and Pac-10 balance beam champion, as well as earning a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention. On September 11, 2003, at the beginning of her senior year, Beckerman was dismissed from the UCLA team by coach Valorie Kondos Field. Kondos Field claimed that the dismissal was due to Beckerman's performance in training and unenthusiastic attitude, although Beckerman disputed those allegations. Beckerman was stripped of her athletic scholarship and housing, but completed her degree. In 2020, following widespread public discussion on social media under the hashtag \"#gymnastalliance\" of allegations by gymnasts of an abusive gymnastics culture that rewarded coaches who damaged and belittled gymnasts, Beckerman posted an open letter to Ms Kondos Field on social media where she related her experiences of competing at UCLA.\n\nPost-gymnastics career \nAs of 2018, Beckerman owns a music school and works as an emergency medical technician in New Jersey. In a 2018 interview after the USA gymnastics abuse scandal became public, Beckerman expressed that she was \"leaning toward\" favoring the dissolution of USA Gymnastics because \"the structure needs to be changed completely so obedience isn't the desired outcome.\" She said:\"When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment. So, you don't speak out, because it's ingrained in you that if you do, you have poor integrity, that you're a bad gymnast, a bad teammate. Asking questions [in elite gymnastics] is very taboo.\"\n\nPersonal life \nBeckerman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey to Howard and Melanie Beckerman. She has two brothers and is the middle sibling. Beckerman grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey, where she attended Middletown High School South. In 2014, she married Matthew King.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBeckerman gymnastic biography\nUCLA Player bio\n\n1981 births\nLiving people\nAmerican female artistic gymnasts\nJewish American sportspeople\nJewish gymnasts\nMiddletown High School South alumni\nUCLA Bruins women's gymnasts\nSportspeople from Long Branch, New Jersey\nPeople from Middletown Township, New Jersey\nPeople from Wyoming, Ohio\nSportspeople from the Cincinnati metropolitan area\nSportspeople from the New York metropolitan area\nPan American Games medalists in gymnastics\nPan American Games silver medalists for the United States\nU.S. women's national team gymnasts\nGymnasts at the 1999 Pan American Games\n21st-century American Jews\n21st-century American women", "machine_text": " Alyssa Beckerman (born December 3, 1980) is an American actress and singer.

Norris, an alumnus of Northwestern University who died in 1967. In his memory, Mr Norris's parents contributed $2.5 million toward the construction of a student center on the recently finished lakefill.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe center was designed in 1971 by renowned Modernist architect Edward D. Dart, and boasts an area of approximately 150,000 square feet.\n\nCommunity center\nAs the community center for Northwestern University's students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests, the Norris University Center provides services and programs designed to benefit members of the Northwestern family. Through various forms of involvement and as an integral component of the university, Norris Center offers students, in particular, direct experiences in participatory decision-making, encourages self-directed activities, and educates for leadership and social responsibility in an effort to complement classroom learning. By cultivating a sense of community and a spirit of loyalty, the Center's goal is to serves as a unifying force in the life of the University.\n\nServices hub\nNorris University Center serves as the hub of campus activity. Norris Center offers various services and resources to enhance students\u2019 experience. It also offers involvement opportunities through the Center for Student Involvement, a wide variety of food options, textbooks and spirit gear from the Norris Bookstore, as well many other opportunities for creativity, adventure, and fun outside of the classroom.  It used to have a bar in it, but it was shuttered for both insurance and fire code reasons.\n\nNew Student Center Initiative\nIn 2010, a group of students began to campaign for a new student center to be built on campus, replacing the Norris University Center. The New Student Center Initiative is a student-led movement for the creation of a new student center. The initiative includes an ad hoc committee in which all Northwestern students are invited to apply, join, and contribute to the lobbying of the New Student Center.  According to their proposal, the New Student Center Initiative is driven by a belief that a new, state-of-the art student center located closer to the center of campus will help create a greater sense of community throughout the University. A new building designed with this purpose in mind, they argue, would include more venue space, meeting space, centralized student services, food options and general entertainment. In addition, moving the student center to the Garret parking lot would be more of a focal point for students to congregate on campus. Those who argue the necessity of building a new student center cite the positive effect of peer institutions' larger or more comprehensive student centers.\n\nResponding to lobbies from the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee (UBPC), the NU administration has engaged the consulting firm Brailsford and Dunlavey to assess how best to rebuild, repurpose, or renovate the University Center to better serve students' needs. In the spring of 2012, the consultants are researching student opinion via focus groups and small meetings, which will then allow them to put together and distribute a large scale survey on the topic.\n\nExternal links\n Official homepage\n\nReferences\n\nNorthwestern University\nNorthwestern University campus\n1971 establishments in Illinois\nEdward D.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Ortenbach\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Ortenbach, also known as the Battle of Gengenbach, took place on 23 July 1678 during the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War, in the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It featured a French army commanded by Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy and an Imperial force under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. \n\nWhile in reality a skirmish, rather than a battle, Ortenbach was part of a series of events that enabled the French to secure Alsace and capture both Kehl and the crossing over the Rhine near the Imperial city of Strasbourg. The war ended in January 1679 when France and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Nijmegen; Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt\u00e9, before the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden forced them to relinquish most of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what Louis XIV viewed as Dutch ingratitude for previous French support, in May 1672 French forces invaded the Dutch Republic. \n\nThey initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they received support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and the Spanish Empire. This was formalised by the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, which opened a new front in the Rhineland; despite being outnumbered, poor co-ordination between the Imperial armies and the skill of Turenne's skill allowed the French to retain the vital territory of Alsace. \n\nTurenne's death at Salzbach in 1675 forced the French onto the defensive and in September 1676, the Imperialists regained Philippsburg and control of the Rhine crossing at Strasbourg. During 1677, the new French commander de Cr\u00e9quy prevented them invading Alsace by astute manoeuvring; he won a minor battle at Kochersberg in October and then captured Freiburg im Breisgau. \n\nWith peace negotiations nearing completion at Nijmegen, Louis planned a rapid campaign in March and April 1678 to strengthen his position in the Spanish Netherlands, remaining on the defensive elsewhere. De Cr\u00e9quy was instructed not to seek battle and ensure the retention of Freiburg; despite his successful defence of Alsace, Louis had limited confidence in him due to his defeat at Konzer Br\u00fccke in 1675 and subsequent loss of Trier. While an apparently minor defeat, it clearly rankled, since it was specifically mentioned in the eulogy delivered at Louis' funeral in 1715.  \n\nIn the spring of 1678, de Cr\u00e9quy concentrated his forces at Scherwiller, where he was reinforced by the Army of the Moselle under Schomberg. Charles of Lorraine began assembling an army of 30,000 outside Offenburg, intending to re-capture Freiburg and in late June, de Cr\u00e9quy sought to divert him by moving against Rheinfelden, now in Switzerland. Charles despatched Starhemberg and 7,000 men to its relief but the French caught them crossing the river, inflicting 3,000 casualties, many drowned, and taking 800 prisoners. After this success, Louis gave de Cr\u00e9quy permission to attack the main Imperial force, if he saw an opportunity to do so.\n\nThe battle\n\n \nThroughout the war, the logistics support designed by Louvois allowed French armies to move faster and open campaigns much earlier, even during the winter, when armies traditionally halted operations due to lack of forage for cavalry and transport. This was enhanced by a systematic policy of denying supplies to the enemy through blockades and the destruction of towns, villages and farms.\n\nTheir comparative advantage was particularly marked in the Rhineland, due to the weakness of the Imperial system and their armies' dependence on proximity to the Rhine for resupply. In May 1677, the English envoy in Vienna reported Charles of Lorraine was short of ammunition and his troops unable to survive more than three days away from the river. \n\nIn the 1677 campaign, the Imperialists sustained severe losses from disease and hunger due to the strain placed on their supply lines by constant marching and counter-marching; Freiburg was captured in November because they were incapable of defending it. De Cr\u00e9quy now repeated this strategy; leaving Choiseul at Rheinfelden to reduce the remaining Imperial strongpoints and burn down Bad S\u00e4ckingen, he returned to Bad Krozingen, 15 kilometres south-west of Freiburg. By mid July, most of the Imperial army was spread out between the villages of Gengenbach and Lahr, with forward elements at Denzlingen (see Map).\n\nAs in the previous year, the Imperial army began to disintegrate due to disease and desertion forcing Charles to withdraw behind the Kinzig, a tributary of the Rhine providing a natural defence barrier in front of Offenburg. On 23 July, the French attempted to cross it but were prevented from doing so by the Imperial cavalry; this is the encounter known as the Battle of Ortenbach. Charles refused to commit his forces to a general engagement and retreated to Oberkirch but at the price of being cut off from the Rhine; on 27 July, de Cr\u00e9quy captured Kehl, its bridge over the Rhine and the associated fort of Etoile. \n \nBoth the Dutch Republic and Spain had ended the war by mid-August but Emperor Leopold continued to delay in the hope of regaining some of his losses. Charles crossed back onto the left back of the Rhine at Philippsburg but found de Cr\u00e9quy once again blocking his advance. In late September, he admitted defeat and withdrew to the Electoral Palatinate, which ended the campaign.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn the January 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, France retained Kehl and Freiburg-im-Breisgau; Emperor Leopold then further damaged relationships with his German allies by unsuccessfully demanding he be granted the Free Imperial Cities of Gengenbach, Zell-am-Harmersbach and Offenburg as 'compensation.'\n\nAs the entry point into Alsace, Louis decided Strasbourg had to be annexed; de Cr\u00e9quy's 1678 campaign allowed him to blockade the city if needed and on 30 September 1681, French troops occupied the city. French possession of Strasbourg was confirmed by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick but in return they withdrew from territories on the right bank of the Rhine, including Kehl and Freiburg.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n \n\nConflicts in 1678\nOrtenbach\nOrtenbach\n1678 in France\nBattle of Ortenbach\nOrtenbach", "machine_text": " Battle of Ortenbach The Battle of Ortenbach was fought on 6 November 1634 during the Thirty Years' War. A Swedish army under the command of General Johan Ban\u00e9r defeated an Imperial army under the command of General count Melchior von Hatzfeldt. The battle took place at Ortenbach, a village which is today a district of the town of Pforzheim in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. After the defeat of the Swedes at the First Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen in August 1634, the Swedish forces were split into two separate armies. One army, under the command of General Johan Ban\u00e9r, was to remain in Germany, while the other, under the command of General Lennart Torstenson, was to be dispatched to Italy to join the war against the Habsburgs there. In October 1634, Ban\u00e9r's army was defeated at the Battle of Wietersheim, when it tried to prevent the imperial army under General Count Melchior von Hatzfeldt from crossing the Neckar river. After this defeat, the Swedish army under Ban\u00e9r was in full retreat towards the Protestant duchies of Brunswick and Hesse. The Imperial armyPursued the Swedes and caught up with them at Ortenbach. On November 5, Ban\u00e9r's army crossed the Black Forest from the direction of Stuttgart and arrived at Pforzheim. The Imperial army had already occupied the town of Pforzheim, and the Swedish army had to camp outside the town. During the night, Ban\u00e9r decided to attack the Imperial army at dawn the next day. The attack was to be directed at the center of the Imperial line, which was held by the Croatians and other irregular troops. If the attack was successful, the bulk of the Imperial army would be surrounded and cut off from the rest of the forces. At 6 o'clock on the morning of November 6, the Swedish army attacked. The attack was successful, and the Imperial center was quickly defeated. However, the Imperial cavalry on the wings of the army was not surrounded and was able to retreat. The Swedish army did not have the cavalry to pursue the Imperial forces, and the pursuit was left to the Swedish reserve infantry. The pursuit continued for three days, until the Imperial forces had retreated across the Rhine river. Although the battle was a clear Swedish victory, it did not have any political consequences. The Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, had been killed at the Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen, and the Swedish forces in Germany were no longer under the command of a king. The Swedish army was in full retreat after the battle, and the only result of the battle was that the Imperial army had to delay its plans to invade the Protestant duchies.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59747434}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nusach (Jewish custom)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In Judaism, Nusach ( nusa\u0127, modern pronunciation nusakh or n\u00fasakh), plural nuschaot () or nusachim () refers to the exact text of a prayer service; sometimes the English word \"rite\" is used to refer to the same thing. Texts used by different communities include Nosach Teiman, Nusach Ashkenaz, Nusach Sefard, Nusach Edot Hamizrach, and Nusach Ari. In English, the word nusach means formulate, wording. \n\nTextual nusach is distinct from musical nusach, which refers to the musical style or tradition of a community, particularly the chant used for recitative prayers such as the Amidah.\n\nMeanings\nNusach primarily means \"text\" or \"version\", the correct wording of a religious text or liturgy. Thus, the nusach tefillah is the text of the prayers, either generally or in a particular community.\n\nIn common use, nusach has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is one example of minhag, which includes traditions on Jewish customs of all types.\n\nVarieties\n\nNusach Ashkenaz\n\nNusach Ashkenaz is the style of service conducted by Ashkenazi Jews, originating from central and eastern Europe. It is the shortest lengthwise (except for the \"Baladi\" Yemenite Nusach).\n\nIt may be subdivided into the German, or western, branch (\"Minhag Ashkenaz\"), used in western and central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian branch (\"Minhag Polin\"), used in eastern Europe, the United States and among Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as \"Lithuanian\", in Israel.\n\nThe form used in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (except Canada, which follows the American style), known as \"Minhag Anglia\"  \nis technically a subform of \"Minhag Polin\" but has many similarities to the German rite. See Singer's Siddur.\n\nNusach Sefard\n\nNusach Sefard is the style of service used by some Jews of central and eastern European origins, especially Hasidim, who adopted some Sephardic customs emulating the practice of the Ari's circle of kabbalists, most of whom lived in the Land of Israel. Textually speaking it is based on the Sephardic rite, but in melody and feel it is overwhelmingly Ashkenazi.\n\nNusach Ari\n\nNusach Ari is a variant of Nusach Sefard, used by Chabad Hasidim.\n\nSephardi and Mizrachi nuschaot\n\nThere is not one generally recognized uniform nusach for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews.  Instead, Sephardim and Mizrahim follow several slightly different but closely related nuschaot.\n\nThe nearest approach to a standard text is found in the siddurim printed in Livorno from the 1840s until the early 20th century.  These (and later versions printed in Vienna) were widely used throughout the Sephardic and Mizrahi world.  Another popular variant was the text known as Nusach ha-Hida, named after Chaim Yosef David Azulai.  Both these versions were particularly influential in Greece, Iran, Turkey and North Africa.  However, most communities also had unwritten customs which they would observe, rather than following the printed siddurim exactly: it is easy, from the printed materials, to get the impression that usage in the Ottoman Empire around 1900 was more uniform than it really was.\n\nOther variants include:\nthe customs of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, based on an older form of the Castilian rite, with some influence from the customs both of Italian Jews and of Northern Morocco.  This version is distinguished by the near-absence of Kabbalistic elements.\nNusah Adot Hamizrah, originating among Iraqi Jews but now popular in many other communities.  These are based on the opinions of Yosef Hayyim and have a strong Kabbalistic flavour.\nMinhag Aram Soba, as used by Syrian Musta'arabi Jews in earlier centuries (the current Syrian rite is closely based on the Livorno prints).\nthe Moroccan rite, also related to the text of the Livorno prints but with a strong local flavour.  This subdivides into the customs of the Spanish-speaking northern strip and the Arabic-speaking interior of the country.\nformerly, there were variants from different parts of Spain and Portugal, perpetuated in particular synagogues in Thessaloniki and elsewhere, e.g. the Lisbon and Catalan rites, and some North African rites appear to reflect Catalan as well as Castilian influence.\n\nUnder the influence of the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, many Israeli Sephardim have adopted a nusach based largely on the Nusach Edot Hamizrach but omitting some of the Kabbalistic additions.\n\nNosach Teman\n\nA \"Temani\" nosach was the standard among the Jews of Yemen. This is divided into the Baladi (purely Yemenite) and Shami (adopted from Sephardic siddurim) versions. Both rites are recited using the unique Yemenite pronunciation of Hebrew, which Yemenite Jews, and some scholars, regard as the most authentic, and most closely related to the Hebrew of Ancient Israel.\n\nThe Baladi rite is very close to that codified by Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah. One form of it is used by the Dor Daim, who attempt to safeguard the older Baladi tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance. This version used by dardaim was originally used by all Yemenite Jews near the time of Maimonides.\n\nNussach Eretz Yisrael\nIn the period of the Geonim, Jews in Israel followed the Nussach Eretz Yisrael which is based upon the Talmud Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud), while the Jewish diaspora followed the customs of Babylonian Jewry. \n\nThe modern Nusach Eretz Yisrael is a recent attempt by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim at reconstructing the ancient Nussach Eretz Yisrael, based on the Jerusalem Talmud and documents discovered in the Cairo Geniza and other sources. The reconstruction is published in the form of a siddur (\"prayer book\"), and used by Rabbi Bar-Hayim's Jerusalem followers in public prayers held in Machon Shilo's synagogue.\n\nOther nuschaot\nIn addition, there are other nuschaot.\nNussach HaGR\"A was a very brief version of Nussach Ashkenaz written by the Vilna Gaon, removing some passages which he believed had were not in the original prayer text, correcting some grammatical errors (according to him), and some additional small changes.\nThe Minhag Italiani and Minhag Ben\u00e8 Rom\u00ec are used by some Italian Jews, as well as by a small number of minyanim in Jerusalem and Netanya.\nClosely related to these was the \"Romaniote\" rite from  Greece where have lived an ancient, pre-Diaspora Jewish community.  The surviving Romaniote synagogues are in Ioannina, Chalkis, Athens, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and New York, these now use a Sephardic rite but with romaniote variations, romaniote piyyutim, combined with own melodies and customs and their special form of Byzantine-Jewish Cantillation.  There were formerly Romaniote synagogues in Istanbul. (The customs of Corfu are a blend between Romaniote, Apulian and Sephardic rites.)\nThere was once a French nusach, closely related to the Ashkenazi, which is now used only in certain towns in Northern Italy (see Appam).\nDistinct Persian and Proven\u00e7al nuschaot also existed before being gradually replaced by the Edot Hamizrach and Spanish and Portuguese nuschaot respectively.\n The Urfalim Jews of south eastern Anatolia follow their own prayer rite, which differs from the Syrian, Kurdish and Iraqi Jewish rites.\n\nIt is said among some mystics that an as-yet undisclosed nusach will be revealed after the coming of the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah. Others say that the differences in nusach are derived from differences between the twelve tribes of Israel, and that in Messianic times each tribe will have its proper nusach. The concept of one nusach for each of the 12 tribes was formulated by R' Isaac Luria; at the time there were exactly 12 Jewish communities in Luria's city of Safed, and each community's nusach was meant to stand in place of that of one of the tribes.\n\nHalakhot\n\nAccording to Rabbi David Bar-Hayim, halakha permits a Jew to change his nusach at any time, even on a daily basis. Most halakhic authorities dispute this, and assume that one should follow the nusach of his family, or at the very least follow one nusach consistently.\n\nSee also\nMinhag\nSiddur\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  A Historical Map of Jewish Liturgical Influence and Variation\n  Western Ashkenazi Nusach\n  Audio and text from the traditional Siddur SiddurAudio.com\n\n \nJewish music\nYiddish words and phrases\nYiddish words and phrases in Jewish law\nHebrew words and phrases in Jewish prayers and blessings\nHebrew words and phrases in Jewish law", "machine_text": " Nusach Nusach (Hebrew: \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d7, plural: \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd nusakhim) is the Hebrew word for \"version\" or \"edition\", and it is also used to refer to the customariness of a particular version of the Jewish prayers, as opposed to the Hebrew word minhag, which means \"custom\". The main nusach used by Ashkenazim (or \" Ashekenazim\") is called Nusach Ashkenaz. The prayers of the Ashkenazim are collectively known as the Siddur of Ashkenaz. There also exists a nusach which is used by the Sefardim, called Nusach Sefard, as well as a nusach used by the Italic Jews, called Nusach Italkit. Nusach is not the same as minhag, although the two words are often conflated. The difference is that minhag refers to a custom that is unique to a particular community, whereas nusach refers to the version of the prayers used by a community which shares the same customs as another community, but which has a different nusach. For example, the nusach used by the Hasidic community is Nusach Sefard, but most Hasidic Jews are also bound by the minhagim of their particular Hasidic dynasty. The nusach used by most Sephardic Jews is Nusach Sefard, but there are some Sephardic Jews who use a nusach unique to their community. There are several nusach Hatefillah (prayer versions), including Nusach Ashkenaz, Nusach Sefard, Nusach Eretz Yisrael, and Nusach Italkit. Additionally, there are nusachim for the other areas of Jewish practice, including nusach Tiberias for the benches (shulchan) and nusach Jerusalem for the Shabbat table.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2457629}

It aired in the United States on Fox on November 3, 2019. The writer was Max Cohn.\n\nPlot\nThe Simpson family visits the Aquatraz Water Park, where Lisa notices how unhappy the animals are behind glass, including a penguin funeral, while Homer notices how much fun boat owners have, remembering how much he wanted one as a kid while fishing with his father.\n\nA boat salesman notices Homer watching the boats and convinces him to buy one. Bart, Lisa, and Groundskeeper Willie go back to the water park to free the whale trapped in it, with Bart finally understanding altruism and liking it. Homer takes the family on a ride on his boat called the 'Something's Fishy' and even Marge agrees it was a good idea to buy it.\n\nThe next rider on the boat is Grampa. But when they return to the pier, the boat starts sinking and Raphael offers his help as a mechanic while Bart is sharing a plan with Milhouse to free other animals in his newfound spirit of altruism.\n\nHomer offers Lenny and Carl to share the boat, and the expenses to fix it. Bart and Milhouse go to the Springfield Zoo and free a gorilla named Lolo, but he goes on a rampage while Milhouse narrowly escapes getting eaten by two tigers.\n\nBart calls Lisa for help since the police are useless on capturing Lolo. Homer starts co-owning the boat with even more people and the boat sinks due to the weight. Lolo rampages at the Springfield Elementary School and Lisa stops him using Seinfeld to calm him down.\n\nLisa takes Lolo home to help him go back to a life of freedom and takes him to Dr. Jane Goodall at the Pennsylvania Ape Reserve where he will be loved. At Moe's Tavern, it ends well when Homer convinces the co-owners of being as good as someone who owns a boat because they owned one for five minutes.\n\nReception\nDennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C stating, \u201cLisa frees a killer whale. Bart frees a gorilla. Homer buys a boat. Bare story bones. Nothing wrong with that. The Simpsons\u2019 world is made up of outlandish situations rendered possible, sometimes even plausible, by animation and the show's forgiving rules of reality. Some of the best episodes sound just as sparse in outline. Homer goes to space. Springfield gets a monorail. Lisa and Bart thwart a supervillain's plot to drown Springfield.\"\n\nTony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 2.5 out of 5, stating that the episode \"doesn't truly shine. There are a lot of very funny lines and gags, but nothing which truly distinguishes it as comic gold. This isn't the fault of Lisa's social justice warmongering. Kent Brockman offers cutting commentary after Lolo wreaks havoc on Springfield saying, 'The police, as always, are useless.' Which cuts to a scene where Springfield's bluest kill a perfectly harmless balloon. The water is only tepid and while good gags are on tap, they are not premium blend.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2019 American television episodes\nThe Simpsons (season 31) episodes", "machine_text": " Gorillas on the Mast is a 2022 American drama film directed by Daniel CRUM.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Gabriele M\u00fcnter\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Gabriele M\u00fcnter (19 February 1877 \u2013 19 May 1962) was a German expressionist painter who was at the forefront of the Munich avant-garde in the early 20th century. She studied and lived with the painter Wassily Kandinsky and was a founding member of the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter.\n\nEarly life\nM\u00fcnter was born to upper middle-class parents in Berlin on 19 February 1877. Her family supported her desires to become an artist. Her father died in 1886. She began to draw as a child. As she was growing up, she had a private tutor. In 1897, at the age of twenty, M\u00fcnter received artistic training in the D\u00fcsseldorf studio of artist Ernst Bosch and later at the Damenschule (Women's School) with artist Willy Spatz.\n\nBy the time she was 21 years old, both of her parents had died and she was living at home with no occupation. In 1898, she decided to take a trip to America with her sister to visit extended family. They stayed in America for more than two years, mainly in the states of Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri; six sketchbooks survive from M\u00fcnter's period in America, depicting images of people, plants and landscapes. Both girls had inherited a large amount of money, allowing them to live freely and independently. Her childhood and early adulthood greatly impacted her future artistic career. She had a free and unrestricted life that was unconstrained by convention. M\u00fcnter studied woodcut techniques, sculpture, painting, and printmaking.\n\nIn 1901, she attended the beginners' classes of Maximilian Dasio at the Damenakademie (Women's Academy) of the M\u00fcnchener K\u00fcnstlerinnenverein (Munich Women Artists's Association). M\u00fcnter then studied at the Phalanx School in Munich, an avant-garde institution founded by Russian artist, Wassily Kandinsky. At the Phalanx School, M\u00fcnter attended sculpture courses taught by Wilhelm H\u00fcsgen. M\u00fcnter studied outside the official art academies in Munich and D\u00fcsseldorf, as these were closed to women.  At the Phalanx School, M\u00fcnter was introduced to Post-Impressionism and the marking techniques of a palette knife and a brush. Her vivid colors and bold outlines were somewhat derived from Gauguin and the Fauves whom she admired. Along with this, M\u00fcnter was inspired by Bavarian folk art, particularly the technique of reverse-glass painting (Hinterglasmalerei in German).\n\nSoon after she began taking classes, M\u00fcnter became professionally involved with Kandinsky. This eventually turned into a personal relationship that lasted for over a decade. Kandinsky was the first teacher that had actually taken M\u00fcnter's painting abilities seriously. In the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited M\u00fcnter to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps, and she accepted.\n\nWork \n\nM\u00fcnter was heavily focused on German Expressionism, and she worked in various mediums, including a significant output in wood- and linocuts. She kept a journal and documented her journeys with a state-of-the-art camera. She was familiar with many of the more famous artists of the time; in one of her journals, she stated that she wanted to learn from the avant-garde artists in France.\n\nM\u00fcnter was part of a small subgroup of artists active in transforming late Impressionist, Neo-Impressionist, and Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau) painting into the more radical, non-naturalistic art now identified as Expressionism. Early on, M\u00fcnter developed a great interest in landscapes. M\u00fcnter's landscape paintings employ a radical Jugendstil simplicity and suggestive symbolism with softly muted colors, collapsed pictorial space and flattened forms. She enjoyed exploring the world of children; using colorful prints of children and toys, M\u00fcnter shows precision and simplicity of form in her rejection of symbolic content.\n\nBy 1908, her work began to change. Strongly influenced by Matisse and Fauvism, Gauguin, and van Gogh, M\u00fcnter's work became more representative and she took refuge in the small Bavarian market town of Murnau, a village untouched by industrialization, progress, and technology. M\u00fcnter bought a house in Murnau and spent much of her life there. It was here, in M\u00fcnter's landscape paintings, that she emphasized nature, imaginative landscapes and an opposition to German modernism. M\u00fcnter's landscapes are unusual in their use of blues, greens, yellows, and pinks; and color plays a large role in M\u00fcnter's early works. Color is used to evoke feelings: picturesque, inviting, imaginative, and rich in fantasy. In M\u00fcnter's landscapes, she presents the village and countryside as manifestations of human life; there is a constant interaction and coexistence with nature.\n\nM\u00fcnter and Kandinsky's relationship affected Kandinsky's work. He began to adopt M\u00fcnter's use of saturated colors and abstract expressionist style. M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky traveled through Europe including the Netherlands, Italy, and France, as well as North Africa. It was during this time that they met Rousseau and Matisse. M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky helped establish the Munich-based avant-garde group called the New Artists\u2019 Association (Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung). She contributed to a number of the most significant avant-garde exhibitions in Germany up till World War I.\n\nIn 1911 M\u00fcnter was one of the first artists to exhibit with Kandinsky's German Expressionist group known as Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). Within the group, artistic approaches and aims varied amongst artists; however, they shared a common desire to express spiritual truths through art. They championed modern art, the connection between visual art and music, the spiritual and symbolic associations of color and a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting in its move toward abstraction.\n\nThere is a transition in M\u00fcnter's work from copying nature more or less impressionistically to feeling its content, abstracting, and drawing out an extract. There grew an interest in painting the spirit of the modern civilization, its social and political turmoil and its gravitation towards materialism and alienation. M\u00fcnter noted that pictures are all moments of life: instantaneous visual experiences, generally rapid and spontaneous; her paintings each have their own identity, their own shape, and their own function.\n\nFor M\u00fcnter, it is the use of color that expresses these ideas. The German Expressionists moved towards primitive art as a model of abstraction or non-representational, non-academic, non-bourgeois art. The German artist looked not for harmony of outward appearance, but for the mystery hidden behind the external form. He (or she) was interested in the soul of things, wanting to lay it bare.\n\nLater years\n\nWhen World War I began, M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky relocated to Switzerland. In 1914, Kandinsky returned to Russia without her, and his marriage in 1917 to Nina Andreevskaya marked the end of M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky's relationship. Subsequently, there was a period of inactivity in her art career. She returned a number of paintings and drawings to Kandinsky, and stored other pieces in a warehouse for many years. She resumed painting in the late 1920s after she had moved back to Germany with Johannes Eichner after the war.\n\nIn the 1930s, as tension started to grip Europe, and modernist movements were condemned in Germany by the Nazi government, she had all of the art work done by her, Kandinsky, and the other members of the Blaue Reiter transported to her house, where she hid them. In spite of her financial problems, she preserved them with care during World War II. Through several house searches, the pieces were never found.\n\nOn her eightieth birthday, M\u00fcnter gave her entire collection, which consisted of more than 80 oil paintings and 330 drawings, to the St\u00e4dtische Galerie in the Lenbachhaus in Munich. In 1956, M\u00fcnter received a few awards such as the Culture Prize from the City of Munich. M\u00fcnter's work was exhibited in the 1960s in the US for the first time and was shown at Mannheim Kunsthalle in 1961. When she was with Johannes Eichner, she still continued to represent the movement.\n\nThe Gabrielle M\u00fcnter and Johannes Eichner foundation was established and has become a valuable research center for M\u00fcnter's art, as well as the art that was done by the Blaue Reiter group. M\u00fcnter lived the rest of her life in Murnau, traveling back and forth to Munich. She died at home in Murnau am Staffelsee on 19 May 1962.\n\nIn 2018, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art of Copenhagen, Denmark, ran an exhibition from May to August with about 130 works by Gabriele M\u00fcnter, many of which were being shown for the first time, in the artist's first comprehensive retrospective in decades.\n\nStyle \nM\u00fcnter's style evolved over the course of her career. Her early works from her days at the Phalanx school show an extensive use of the palette knife and a limited color range of yellows, greens and browns. Her subsequent landscapes, many of which were painted in Murnau, employed strong contours around a palette of blue, green, yellow, and pink, often with red for emphasis.  Throughout her career, color continued to play a large role in her work. In the early 1920s, M\u00fcnter painted portraits with the minimal line and compositional clarity valued in Neue Sachlichkeit circles of the day.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Behr, Shulmith, Movements in Modern Art: Expressionism.

Gabriele M\u00fcnter was born in Berlin. Her father, August M\u00fcnter, was a manufacturer and her mother, Luise, was a pianist. She was the fourth of six children. At the age of six, she began taking dancing lessons, and at sixteen she went to the barbershop and began to dance professionally in the evenings. She studied the theory and practice of music at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin from 1894 to 1897, and then from 1897 to 1899 she studied painting at the Damenakademie in Munich. In 1899, M\u00fcnter met Kandinsky, and they began a relationship that would last until the end of both their lives. She became a central figure in the artists' group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), which was formed in 1911, and also in the Erste M\u00fcnchner Group (First Munich Group) and the Novembergruppe (November Group). She organized the first exhibition of the Blue Rider in the Munich KammerArtsalon in the spring of 1912, and a second exhibition in the autumn of that year in Berlin. In addition to her own artistic work, she was an important collector and supporter of other artists, in particular the Russian expressionists. She was also a teacher and, in 1940, founded the Gabriele M\u00fcnter School in Munich. In 1914, M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky spent a summer together in Murnau, a small village in the Bavarian Alps, where they were able to escape the First World War, which had just broken out. The landscape of the Bavarian countryside inspired both artists, and they produced a large number of works in a variety of styles. In addition to their own paintings, they collected folk art and folk costumes, as well as religious objects, which they used in their teaching. They lived together in a house they called the \"Albrecht D\u00fcrer House,\" which they shared with their Russian friend Alexei Jawlensky and, for a time, with the actress and dancer Alexander tyne. After the war, M\u00fcnter and Kandinsky moved to Munich, where they lived for the rest of their lives. They were married in December 1921. In the late 1920s, they acquired an apartment in the Schwabing district of Munich, where they lived until their deaths. In addition to her work as an artist and collector, M\u00fcnter was a teacher at the Bauhaus school in Dessau from 1919 to 1923 and at the Folkwanerne in Copenhagen from 1927 to 1931. She also gave lectures on art and aesthetics and organized exhibitions of her own work and that of other artists. In the last years of her life, M\u00fcnter's health began to deteriorate, and she died in Munich on 17 October 1962. Her work is represented in many major museums and private collections.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1692794}

Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil\u2019s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the \"new\" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.\n\nUnlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solid\u00e1ria also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program.  She published a book about these experiences,  Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office.\n\nShe died in S\u00e3o Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest. She had been discharged from the S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas Hospital the previous day, June 23, 2008, having previously been admitted with chest pains.\n\nPublications \n\nBooks\n\n Bibliografia Sobre a Juventude (with Helena Sampaio, Edusp, 1995)\n Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002)\n\nArticles and miscellaneous works\n\n 1983: Movimentos Sociais Urbanos: Balan\u00e7o Cr\u00edtico.

A calico-printing works drew water power from the culverted River Wansunt in early Victorian times, being later adapted for the manufacture of rubber goods, then felt and finally Brussels carpets. This carpet mill was demolished by 1890 and Barnes Cray House, the next largest building, was cleared by 1933, ending its days as a nursing home.\n\nThe remnants of the settlement became absorbed into Crayford with the building of a munition village to facilitate the expansion of Vickers' armaments factory during the 1915 to 1919 period.\nIn 1920 the area became part of the Crayford Urban District of Kent (having previously been in Dartford Rural District). \nFollowing World War I Crayford Urban District Council erected further housing estates to the north, eventually merging with estates spreading southwards from Erith.

In the late 1970s, he formed the Association of Non-Conformist Students, which soon transformed into the Serbian nationalist organization known as the Tigers. The Tigers' initial goal was to unite the various Serbian nationalist groups in Yugoslavia and create a Serbian superstate, which would include all of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and parts of Croatia. To achieve this, the Tigers conducted a series of murders, torture and other crimes against civilians, aiming to create a climate of fear and instability.

The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role.\n\nMullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school\n\nPlot\n\nThe story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets.\n\nBegrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the Hyde Park pet cemetery, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and \u201conly dogs can be depended upon\u201d. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one.\n\nThe following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for. \nThe children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as \u201che wasn\u2019t their grandfather\u201d, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree.\n\nThe following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.\n\nCast\n Peter Sellers as Sam  \n Donna Mullane as Liz  \n John Chaffey as Mark  \n David Daker as Bob Ellis\n Marjorie Yates as Chrissie Ellis  \n Patricia Brake as Dogs Home Secretary\n Don Crown as Busker\n Michael Graham Cox as Park Keeper\n Bruce Purchase as Policeman\n Pat Ashton as Woman at Nursery\n Keith Chegwin as Georgie (uncredited)\n Hilary Pritchard as Laundry lady (uncredited)\n\nNovel and screenplay\nSimmons is said to have planned the film around the time his two award-winning short films Sunday By the Sea (1953) and Bow Bells (1954) were released. Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works.  Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety wrote, \"It all sounds like goo, and the film\u2019s last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\" while The New York Times described the film as \"the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker.

The term was coined by the American boxer and manager Jack \"Kid\" Berg, who trained at the noted Jewish Lads' Club in the area.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan underwent a period of rapid modernization. Many artists and writers began to question traditional Japanese art and culture, and to explore the relationship between art and society. This period of intellectual and artistic exploration came to be known as the \"Modernist\" movement. Hidekatsu was one of the leaders of the Modernist movement in Japan. He was a prolific writer and artist, and his work often featured bold, experimental styles. He was a strong advocate for the importance of art in society, and he often spoke out against the conservative, traditionalist art establishment in Japan. In the early 20th century, Hidekatsu's work began to be noticed and appreciated by international art critics and collectors. He was featured in many international exhibitions, and his work was acquired by museums and private collectors around the world. In the late 1930s, Hidekatsu's work took a more political turn. He began to use his art to criticize the Japanese military and government, and to protest against the increasing militarization and nationalism of Japanese society. During World War II, Hidekatsu was arrested and imprisoned by the Japanese government for his anti-war art and writings. He was released from prison in 1944, but he was rearrested and executed by the Japanese authorities in 1945. After the war, Hidekatsu's work was widely celebrated in Japan and around the world. Many of his paintings and writings were exhibited and published, and he became known as one of the first \"modern\" Japanese artists.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4015797}

Honaunau-Napoopoo is located south of Honalo and north of Puuhonua o H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park, which is often called the \"City of Refuge\". The community includes three main areas: Honaunau Beach, Napoopoo Beach, and Kealakekua Bay. Honaunau Beach is the site of the only major surfing spot in South Kona, known as \"Honaunau\", which is also the name of the beach. The wave breaks across a broad, flat reef and has a reputation for being a \"long, fun ride\". The surf at Honaunau is typically best in the summer months, when south swells come from the Antarctic. In the winter, the surf is smaller, but the waves are more consistent. Napoopoo Beach is a small beach, and is the site of a condo development. The south end of Kealakekua Bay is also known as \"Kealakekua\", but this has a different pronunciation than the northern end of the bay, and is not to be confused with the community of Kealakekua to the north. The lands of the Kona Village Resort extend to the south end of Kealakekua Bay.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reba: Duets\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Reba: Duets is the twenty-seventh studio album by American country music singer Reba McEntire. It was released September 18, 2007,by MCA Nashville Records and September 24, 2007, by Humphead Records in the UK, and was produced by Tony Brown, Dann Huff, McEntire, and Justin Timberlake.\n\nReba: Duets was McEntire's second album to appear in the new millennium decade and one of her most successful crossover albums, as it is her first studio album to chart in Australia and her 3rd to chart in the UK. It was her first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200, while also reaching #1 on the Top Country Albums chart, and was also her final release for the MCA Nashville label. The album featured collaborations from eleven different artists in the genres of country, pop, and rock.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart with sales of 300,000.\n\nBackground\nReba: Duets was recorded at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Allmusic reviewer, Thom Jurek considered that the quality of the album's tracks was different from that of most other collaboration projects, calling it a \"mixed bag\" of material. The first collaborator on the album was LeAnn Rimes, who recorded the track, \"When You Love Someone Like That\" which also appeared on LeAnn Rimes's Family album that same year. Jurek called the duet between the pair \"stellar,\" while about.com called the pairing \"an undeniable outcome of perfection. Reba's strong country voice with LeAnn's young, soulful sound created a new sound like no other.\"\n\nThe second track, \"Does That Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma\" was a collaboration with Ronnie Dunn (half of the duo Brooks & Dunn), who co-wrote the song with McEntire. The third track is a duet with Kelly Clarkson on one of her previous major pop hits, \"Because of You.\" The song was the album's lead single and had already peaked at #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart at the time of the album's release. The song was criticized by allmusic, saying that, \"the song is simply a big, overblown power ballad with guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals -- think Jim Steinman and you get it.\" The same idea was also said about the fourth track, \"Faith In Love\" with Rascal Flatts. The fifth track was performed with country artist, Trisha Yearwood on the song, \"She Can't Save Him\", which was formerly released as a single by Canadian country artist, Lisa Brokop. Tracks six and seven were collaborations with American pop artist, Carole King and country artist, Kenny Chesney, who both help in providing musical variations towards the album. Country Standard Time called track nine (a collaboration with Faith Hill called \"Sleeping with the Telephone\") \"tearful emotion.\"\n\nThe tenth track was a duet with Justin Timberlake on the song, \"The Only Promise That Remains\", which was co-written by Timberlake himself. The song is performed in Celtic melody and Timberlake performs harmony on most of the song's length. The album closes with \"Break Each Other's Hearts Again\", a duet with Don Henley.\n\nCritical reception\n\nReba: Duets gained fairly positive reviews from most music critics. Allmusic's Thom Jurek stated that although he considered it not to be a \"perfect record\", he did find the album to \"deliver\". Jurek concluded by saying, \"It's sincere, it's polished, and it's full of good to great songs delivered in mostly interesting ways.\" In his review, he gave the album three and a half out of five stars.\n\nReviewing the album, Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave praise to McEntire and her production on the release, saying, \"Give credit to McEntire for corralling the egos - including her own - and producing an album with depth, passion and a bunch of great voices.\"  About.com'''s Scott Sexton gave Reba: Duets four and a half out of five stars, overall stating, \"Reba McEntire has proven she can stand the test of time, and with some help from close friends she sounds better than ever.\" Reviewing Reba: Duets in 2007, Lana Cooper of PopMatters acclaimed McEntire's vocal strength in the album by saying, \"Reba's voice manages to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity.\" Cooper overall stated, \"Reba Duets is largely a strong showing.\"\n\nRelease and aftermathReba: Duets was originally planned to be released in April 2007, however the date was pushed to September 18 instead. The lead single, \"Because of You\" was released to radio May 15 and reached a peak of #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart and #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August, shortly before the album's release date. A week after the album's release, it became the United States' best-selling album of the week, debuting at number one on both the Top Country Albums and Billboard 200 albums charts, selling a total of 300,536 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It debuted at number 4 on the Canadian Album Charts. Reba Duets'' was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 2007, becoming her twentieth platinum album. The album's second single, \"The Only Promise That Remains\" (with Justin Timberlake) was released in November 2007, but only reached #72 on the Billboard Pop 100 and did not chart the Hot Country Songs list. The third single, \"Every Other Weekend\" (with Kenny Chesney) was released in 2008. However, the official single featured Skip Ewing as the duet partner instead of Chesney, due to the Chesney version not being \"viable\" for radio (due to radio company issues). It charted outside the main UK top 100 album chart but has sold over 15,000 copies in the UK. McEntire and LeAnn Rimes performed their duet of \"When You Love Someone Like That\" at the 41st CMA Music Awards.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nMusicians \n\n Reba McEntire \u2013 lead vocals\n Matt Rollings \u2013 Hammond B3 organ (1), acoustic piano (1, 6, 11)\n  John Barlow Jarvis \u2013 acoustic piano (2-5, 9)\n Steve Nathan \u2013 Hammond B3 organ (2, 7, 8)\n Jimmy Nichols \u2013 synthesizer (3, 4, 5, 8), acoustic piano (7), Hammond B3 organ (9)\n Pete Wasner \u2013 acoustic piano (8)\n Michael Thompson \u2013 acoustic guitar (1), electric guitar (1)\n Tom Bukovac \u2013 electric guitar (1-10), acoustic guitar (10, 11)\n Ilya Toshinsky \u2013 acoustic guitar (2-5, 7-10)\n Dean Parks \u2013 acoustic guitar (6), electric guitar (11)\n Jay Dee Maness \u2013 steel guitar (1, 6, 11)\n Paul Franklin \u2013 steel guitar (2-5, 7, 8, 9)\n Rob Ickes \u2013 dobro (10)\n Aubrey Haynie \u2013 fiddle (2, 7, 10), mandolin (3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10)\n Leland Sklar \u2013 bass guitar (1, 6, 11)\n Jimmie Lee Sloas \u2013 bass guitar (2, 7, 8, 9)\n Glenn Worf \u2013 bass guitar (3, 5), upright bass (10)\n Jay DeMarcus \u2013 bass guitar (4), backing vocals (4)\n Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums (1, 6, 11)\n Greg Morrow \u2013 drums (2, 7-9)\n Paul Leim \u2013 drums (3, 5)\n Chris McHugh \u2013 drums (4)\n Bergen White \u2013 string arrangements and conductor (3, 7)\n Carl Gorodetzky \u2013 string contractor (3, 7)\n The Nashville String Machine \u2013 strings (3, 7)\n Larry Gold \u2013 string arrangements and conductor (10)\n Caroline Buckman \u2013 strings (10)\n Alyssa Park \u2013 strings (10)\n Amy Wickman \u2013 strings (10)\n LeAnn Rimes \u2013 lead vocals (1)\n Ronnie Dunn \u2013 lead vocals (2)\n Curtis Wright \u2013 backing vocals (2)\n Jenifer Wrinkle \u2013 backing vocals (2)\n Kelly Clarkson \u2013 lead vocals (3)\n Gary LeVox \u2013 lead vocals (4)\n Joe Don Rooney \u2013 backing vocals (4)\n Trisha Yearwood \u2013 lead vocals (5)\n Carole King \u2013 lead vocals (6)\n Kenny Chesney \u2013 lead vocals (7)\n Vince Gill \u2013 lead vocals (8)\n Ashley Cleveland \u2013 backing vocals (8)\n Kim Keyes \u2013 backing vocals (8)\n Judson Spence \u2013 backing vocals (8)\n Faith Hill \u2013 lead vocals (9)\n Justin Timberlake \u2013 lead vocals (10)\n Matt Morris \u2013 backing vocals (10)\n Don Henley \u2013 lead vocals (11)\n\nProduction notes \n\n Tony Brown \u2013 producer (1-9, 11)\n Reba McEntire \u2013 producer (1-9, 11)\n Dann Huff \u2013 producer (9)\n Justin Timberlake \u2013 producer (10)\n Mike Butler \u2013 recording (1)\n Derek Bason \u2013 additional recording (1, 2, 10), recording (2, 7, 8, 9), mixing (2, 7, 8)\n Nate Hertweck \u2013 recording assistant  (1)\n Todd Tidwell \u2013 additional recording (1, 2), recording assistant (1, 2, 7, 8, 9)\n Chuck Ainlay \u2013 recording (3, 4, 5, 10, mixing (3, 4, 9)\n Kyle Lehning \u2013 additional recording (3, 7, 11), mixing (11)\n Aaron Kasdoff \u2013 recording assistant (3, 4, 5, 10, 11), additional recording (5, 6, 11)\n Casey Wood \u2013 additional recording (3, 7, 11), recording assistant (3, 7, 11)\n David Bryant \u2013 additional recording,  (4, 5, 6, 9, 11), recording assistant ( (4, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n Ben Fowler \u2013 additional recording (4, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n Jeff Balding \u2013 additional recording (5, 6, 11)\n Al Schmitt \u2013 recording (6, 11)\n Steve Genewick \u2013 recording assistant (6, 11)\n Mark Hagen \u2013 additional recording (9)\n Seth Morton \u2013 additional recording (9), recording assistant (9)\n Kevin Mills \u2013 additional recording (10), recording assistant (10)\n Jeff Rothschild \u2013 additional recording (10)\n Steve Marcantonio \u2013 mixing (1, 6)\n J.C.

Ukrayinskiy Tantsyuvalniy Ansambl \"Cheremosh\") is a Ukrainian dance company based in Edmonton, Alberta and a leader of Ukrainian dance in Canada. It was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc and named after the Cheremosh River that separates the historic regions of Bukovyna and Galicia in Ukraine. Since 1991 Cheremosh has been under the direction of Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets. Cheremosh has toured throughout Canada, the United States, Scotland, China, and most recently, a 15-day tour across four Australian cities.\n\nHistory \nThe Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company of Edmonton, Alberta, was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc. The group began with just 19 dancers, and since then has grown to include four performing groups, a School of Dance and over 100 dancers at the various levels. Named after the Cheremosh River that separates the regions of Bukovyna and Halychyna in Ukraine, the company easily matches the river's boisterousness and vivacity.\n\nAs Cheremosh's first Artistic Director, Chester Kuc's goal was to modernize Ukrainian folk dance by attempting to convey certain truths about the Ukrainian people. Using dance to make these truths dramatic and effective, he brought his dances to the stage in order to entertain audiences and further the growth of the rich Ukrainian culture in Canada.\n\nSince its inception, Cheremosh has had five artistic directors. Following Chester Kuc, Richard Wacko, Ken Kachmar and Greg Bayda, respectively, led Cheremosh between the years of 1982 and 1991.\n\nCurrently, all performing groups train under Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets, whose distinctive choreography and meticulous instruction have helped the Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company and its affiliates maintain a strong reputation as a successful and accomplished Ukrainian dance organization.\n\nPast Tours \n 1977 \u2013 Sidmouth International Festival (East Devon, south England)\n 1978 \u2013\n 1984 \u2013\n 1988 \u2013 Encore Cheremosh\n 1993 \u2013 25th Anniversary Tour\n 1999 \u2013 New Beginnings\n 2005 \u2013 Revolutions\n 2007 \u2013 Journey to the Great Wall (China)\n 2009 \u2013 Razom: A Fusion of Ukrainian Dance\n 2010 \u2013 Aberdeen, Scotland\n 2011 \u2013 Bulgaria\n 2012 \u2013 Bud'mo Cheremosh\n 2013 \u2013 Tour of Ukraine\n 2015 \u2013 \"Kaleidoscope\" (U.S. tour)\n 2016 \u2013 \"Kaleidoscope\" (Canada tour)\n 2019 \u2013 Razom: Two Nations, One Spirit (Australia)\n\nOther Achievements \n Have performed for Heads of State, including Queen Elizabeth II and members of the Royal Family; former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, members of Congress and the Senate; Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; and Alberta Premiers Don Getty, Ralph Klein and Ed Stelmach.\n Were chosen as Canada's sole representative to the prestigious 1996 Aberdeen International Youth Festival in Aberdeen, Scotland.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Economy of Nepal\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The economy of Nepal is developing category and largely dependent on agriculture and remittances. An isolated, agrarian society until the mid-20th century, Nepal entered the modern era in 1951 without schools, hospitals, roads, telecommunications, electric power, industry, or civil service. The country has, however, made progress toward sustainable economic growth since the 1950s. The country was opened to economic liberalization, leading to economic growth and improvement in living standards when compared to the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher economic development are the frequent changes in political leadership, as well as corruption.\n\nNepal has used a series of five-year plans in an attempt to make progress in economic development.  It completed its ninth economic development plan in 2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have been privatised. Foreign aid to Nepal accounts for more than half of the development budget. Government priorities over the years have been the development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture, and industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural development efforts have been emphasised.\n\nAgriculture remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65% of the population and providing 31.7% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland and forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an agricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.\n\nGDP is heavily dependent on remittances (9.1%) of foreign workers.  Subsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in Nepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system is under development, and Tribhuvan University has several campuses. Although eradication efforts continue, malaria had been controlled in the fertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. Kathmandu is linked to India and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway network. The capital was almost out of fuel and supplies, due to a crippling general strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.\n\nMajor towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air services. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries have grown rapidly in recent years. Together, they account for approximately 70% of the country's merchandise exports.\n\nThe Cost of Living Index in Nepal is comparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life has declined to much less desirous value in recent years. Nepal was ranked 54th worst of 81 ranked countries (those with GHI > 5.0) on the Global Hunger Index in 2011, between Cambodia and Togo. Nepal's current score of 19.5  is better than in 2010 (20.0) and much improved than its score of 27.5 in 1990.\n\nForeign investments and taxation\nHuge numbers of Small Foreign Investments come to Nepal via the Non Resident Nepali, who are investing in many sectors. Nepal has a huge potential for hydroelectricity. Accordingly, a large number of foreign companies are willing to invest in Nepal, but political instability has stopped the process.\nNepal has entered into agreements for avoidance of double taxation (all in credit method) with 10 countries (PSRD) since 2000. Similarly, it has Investment protection agreements with 5 countries (PSRD) since 1983. In 2014, Nepal restricted the Foreign aid by setting a minimum limit for foreign grants, soft and commercial loans from its development partners.\n\nImports and exports\n\nNepal's merchandise trade balance has improved somewhat since 2000 with the growth of the carpet and garment industries. In the fiscal year 2000\u20132001, exports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the trade deficit down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the European Union has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and vegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine, potatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of the country's garment exports.\n\nThe annual monsoon rain strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.\n\nStrong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid have helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international reserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries.\n\nSeveral multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the UN Development Programme also provide assistance. In June 1998, Nepal submitted its memorandum on a foreign trade regime to the World Trade Organization and in May 2000 began direct negotiations on its accession.\n\nResources\n\nProgress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, tourism and hydroelectricity. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest at 8,848.86 m. In the early 1990s, one large public sector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been completed. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects currently in operation are the Khimti Khola (60 MW) and the Bhote Koshi Project (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China, India and Japan to take the further steps.\n\nNepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially viable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at present, is mere 1095 MW.\n\nThe environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat) New year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are \"run-of-the-river\" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The largest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the West Seti Dam (750 MW) storage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector. Negotiations with India for a power purchase agreement have been underway for several years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem. Currently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's option to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.\n\nPopulation pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is already straining the \"carrying capacity\" of the middle hill areas, particularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover for crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although steep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, mineral surveys have found small deposits of limestone, magnesite, zinc, copper, iron, mica, lead, and cobalt.\n\nThe development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with local indigenous groups, recently empowered by Nepal's ratification of ILO Convention 169.\n\nMacro-economic trend\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Nepal at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund and EconStats with figures in millions of Nepali Rupees.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132018.\n\nStatistics\n\nGDP:  purchasing power parity - $84.37 Billion (2018 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 21.77% (2017)\n\nGDP - per capita:  purchasing power parity (current international $) - $2700 (2017 est.)\nGDP - composition by sector:\nagriculture: 17%\nindustry:    13.5%\nservices:    60.5% (2017 est.)\ntourism:     9%\n\nPopulation below poverty line: 25.6% (2017/2018)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nlowest 10%:   3.2%\nhighest 10%: 29.8% (1995\u201396)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices):  4.5% (2017)\n\nLabour force: 4 million (2016 est.) \n\nLabor force - by occupation: agriculture 19%, services 69%, industry 12% (2014 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate:  1.47% (2017 est.)\n\nBudget:\nrevenues: $5.954 billion\nexpenditures: $5.974 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (2017 est.)\n\nIndustries:\ntourism, carpet, textile; small rice, jute, sugar, and oilseed mills; cigarette; cement and brick production\n\nIndustrial production growth rate:  10.9% (2017 est.):\n\nElectricity - production:  41,083 GWh (2017)\n\nElectricity - production by source:\nfossil fuel: 7.5%\nhydro:      91.5%\nnuclear:        0.3%\nother:          0.7% (2001)\n\nAvailable energy:6257.73 GWh (2017)\nNEA Hydro:2290.78 GWh (2014)\nNEA Thermal:9.56 GWh (2014)\npurchase (total):2331.17 GWh (2014)\nIndia (purchase):2175.04 GWh (2017)\nNepal (IPP):1258.94 GWh (2014)\n\nElectricity - consumption:  4,776.53 GWh (2017)\n\nElectricity - exports:  856 GWh (2001)\nElectricity - imports:  12 GWh (2001)\n\nOil - production:   (2001 est.)\n\nOil - consumption:  2001\n\nAgriculture - products:\nFruits and vegetables, mostly: apples, pears, tomatoes, peaches, nectarines, potatoes, rice, maize, wheat, sugarcane, root crops, milk, and buffalo meat.\n\nExports:  $1.34 billion f.o.b., but does not include unrecorded border trade with India (2017 est.)\n\nExports - commodities: carpets, clothing, leather goods, jute goods, grain\n\nExports - partners: India 56.6%, US 11.5%, Turkey 4% (2016 est.)\n\nImports:  $1.03 billion f.o.b.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fourth Fitna\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Fourth Fitna or Great Abbasid Civil War resulted from the conflict between the brothers al-Amin and al-Ma'mun over the succession to the throne of the Abbasid Caliphate. Their father, Caliph Harun al-Rashid, had named al-Amin as the first successor, but had also named al-Ma'mun as the second, with Khurasan granted to him as an appanage. Later a third son, al-Qasim, had been designated as third successor. After Harun died in 809, al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad. Encouraged by the Baghdad court, al-Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan, and al-Qasim was quickly sidelined. In response, al-Ma'mun sought the support of the provincial \u00e9lites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy. As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened, al-Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army. In 811, al-Amin's troops marched against Khurasan, but al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy, and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself. The city fell after a year, al-Amin was executed, and al-Ma'mun became Caliph. \n\nAl-Ma'mun chose to remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt. In addition, a series of Alid uprisings occurred, beginning with Abu'l-Saraya at Kufa and spreading to southern Iraq, the Hejaz, and Yemen. The pro-Khurasani policies followed by al-Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's eventual espousal of an Alid succession in the person of Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional Baghdad \u00e9lites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival caliph at Baghdad in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene in person. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad, which he entered in 819. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827. Some local rebellions, notably that of the Khurramites, dragged on for far longer, into the 830s.\n\nHistorians have interpreted the conflict variously; in the words of the Iranologist Elton L. Daniel, it has been regard as \"a conflict over the succession between a rather incompetent, besotted al-Amin and his shrewdly competent brother al-Ma'mun; as the product of harem intrigues; as an extension of the personal rivalry between the ministers al-Fadl b. Rabi and al-Fadl b. Sahl; or as a struggle between Arabs and Persians for the control of the government\".\n\nBackground\n\nThe origins of the civil war lie in the succession arrangements of Harun al-Rashid () as well as the internal political dynamics of the Abbasid Caliphate. The two main contenders, Muhammad al-Amin and Abdallah al-Ma'mun, were born six months apart in AH 170 (786/7) with al-Ma'mun being the elder. It was al-Amin however who was named first heir in 792, while al-Ma'mun followed in 799, a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent and their political implications: al-Amin had a solidly Abbasid lineage, being Harun's son by Zubayda, herself descended from the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (), while al-Ma'mun's mother was Marajil, a Persian concubine from Badhgis in Khurasan.\n\nWhile al-Ma'mun's origin was less prestigious than the purely Arab al-Amin, his ties to Khurasan and the Iranian-dominated eastern provinces were an important factor in his choice as heir. In contrast to the exclusively Arab-ruled Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid state was under heavy Iranian, and particularly Khurasani, influence. The Abbasid Revolution, which brought the Abbasids to power, originated in Khurasan, and the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abna\u02be al-dawla (\"sons of the state/dynasty\"). Khurasan retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces, and Harun al-Rashid in particular was careful to cultivate his ties with the Iranian element of the Caliphate, not least through his promotion of the Khurasani Barmakid family to positions of power. Both al-Amin and al-Ma'mun had been tutored in their youth by the Barmakids, al-Amin by al-Fadl ibn Yahya and al-Ma'mun by Ja'far ibn Yahya. While al-Amin would distance himself from the Barmakids and become closely associated with the abna\u02be aristocracy of Baghdad, al-Ma'mun remained influenced by Ja'far and his associates.\n\nIn 802, Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards the extent of the autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.\n\nAlmost immediately after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may reflect the fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abna\u02be and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abna\u02be, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.\n\nThis led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where, according to Elton L. Daniel, \"Abbasid policies [fluctuated] between two extremes. One governor would attempt to extract as much wealth as he could from the province for the benefit of Iraq, the central government, and, not infrequently, himself. When the people protested loudly enough, such governors would be temporarily replaced by ones who would attend to local interests\". The Khurasani elites had a long-standing rivalry with the abna\u02be. Although the latter now resided chiefly in what is now Iraq, they insisted on retaining control of Khurasani affairs and demanded that the province's revenues be sent west to supply their salaries, something strongly resisted by the local Arab and Iranian elites. The resulting tension was eased when al-Fadl ibn Yahya, universally praised as a model governor, was appointed to Khurasan in 793, but was re-fanned in 796, when a member of the abna\u02be, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, was placed in charge of the province. His harsh taxation measures provoked increasing unrest, which expressed itself in Kharijite uprisings and, finally, a rebellion by the governor of Samarkand, Rafi ibn al-Layth. This uprising forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma'mun and the powerful chamberlain (hajib) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809.\n\nCivil war between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, 809\u2013813\nUpon Harun's death, al-Amin ascended the throne in Baghdad, where his popularity was great, while al-Ma'mun remained at Marv, from where he planned to campaign against the remaining rebels. However, al-Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east, leaving al-Ma'mun with little in the way of military forces. It was in this time that al-Ma'mun came to rely upon his wazir, the former Barmakid prot\u00e9g\u00e9 al-Fadl ibn Sahl, who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites, whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed. The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan: the abna\u02be, led by Ali ibn Isa, whom Harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of the Caliph's bodyguard, were joined by other influential officials, chief amongst them al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government, even if that meant breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement.\n\nSome modern scholars have tried to interpret the conflict between the two brothers as a confrontation between the Arab and Iranian elements of the caliphate, represented by the two contenders' mothers. It is true that the Iranian-dominated East generally backed al-Ma'mun, but neither was al-Amin a conscious champion of \"Arabism\", nor was the support for al-Ma'mun the result of his Iranian origin, although his supporters did make propaganda among the local population for the \"son of their sister\". Al-Ma'mun enjoyed the support of the local elites of Khurasan mainly because they saw in him a champion of their newly won autonomy, and because he himself assiduously cultivated that support. Later, during the war, the prospect of his victory also offered the Khurasanis the promise of a yet more privileged position in the new regime. However, the conflict was first and foremost a dynastic dispute, with al-Amin attempting to institute a direct patrilineal succession. In this he did nothing but follow the footsteps of his predecessors since al-Mansur, all of whom struggled against the claims of brothers or cousins. Harun al-Rashid himself was imprisoned during the brief reign of his elder brother al-Hadi (). Given to indolence and lacking any political ability himself, al-Amin entrusted this project to al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, who is generally portrayed as the \"evil genius\" behind al-Amin, and one of the main instigators of the conflict. Very quickly, al-Amin  moved to sideline the youngest brother, Qasim. Initially, Qasim was removed from his governorship of the Jazira, but soon after he was stripped altogether of his place in the succession and placed under guard at Baghdad. It was only because al-Ma'mun resided far from the Caliph's immediate area of control that he escaped sharing this fate. \n\nThe rift between the two camps manifested in 810, when al-Amin added his own son, Musa, to the line of succession. Al-Amin then sent a delegation to Marv, asking al-Ma'mun to return to Baghdad. After al-Ma'mun, fearing for his safety, refused, al-Amin began to interfere with his brother's domain: he protested al-Ma'mun's pardon to Ibn al-Layth after his surrender and asked for tribute from the governors of the western provinces of Khurasan as a sign of submission. He then demanded of his brother the cession of the western regions of Khurasan, the admission of caliphal tax and postal agents into the province, and the forwarding of the Khurasan's revenue to Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun, who could not rely on large military forces and whose position was consequently weak, was at first inclined to accede to his brother's demands, but al-Fadl ibn Sahl dissuaded him from this course and encouraged him to seek support among the native population of Khurasan, who also opposed control by the caliphal court.\n\nAl-Ma'mun, who was already favourably regarded after the excesses of Ali ibn Isa, consciously set about to cultivate the support of the local population, reducing taxes, dispensing justice in person, conceding privileges to the native princes, and demonstratively evoking episodes from the beginnings of the Abbasid movement in the province. He now became a \"political magnet for Iranian sympathisers\" (El-Hibri) refused to cede his province or return to Baghdad, and began to gather around him those dissatisfied with Baghdad's centralizing policies or who had simply been left out of the share of spoils and power after the Abbasid Revolution.\n\nUnder the influence of their respective chief ministers, al-Amin and al-Ma'mun took steps that further polarized the political climate and made the breach irreparable. After al-Ma'mun symbolically removed al-Amin's name from his coins and from the Friday prayer, in November 810 al-Amin removed al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tamin from the succession and nominated his own sons Musa and Abdallah instead. Al-Ma'mun replied by declaring himself imam, a religious title which shied of directly challenging the Caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority, as well as hearkening back to the early days of the Hashimiyya movement which had carried the Abbasids to power.\n\nDespite the reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abna\u02be, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al-Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000\u20135,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle on 3 July 811 resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west.\n\nTahir's unexpected victory was decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abna\u02be, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abna\u02be army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance to get involved in the civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abna\u02be to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abna\u02be began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abna\u02be, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn (\"he of the two headships\"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.\n\nIn spring 812, Tahir, reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A'yan, resumed his offensive. He invaded Khuzistan, where he defeated and killed the Muhallabid governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, whereupon the Muhallabids of Basra surrendered to him. Tahir also took Kufa and al-Mada'in, advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east.At the same time, al-Amin's authority crumbled as supporters of al-Ma'mun took control of Mosul, Egypt and the Hejaz, while most of Syria, Armenia and Adharbayjan fell under the control of local Arab tribal leaders. As Tahir's army closed on Baghdad, the rift between al-Amin and the abna\u02be was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms. The abna\u02be began deserting to Tahir in droves, and in August 812, when Tahir's army appeared before the city, he established his quarters in the suburb of Harbiyya, traditionally an abna\u02be stronghold.\n\nThe historian Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as \"an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society\" and \"the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution\", as Baghdad's urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war. Indeed, it was this \"revolutionary\" situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers' professional expertise, that brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al-Ma'mun's men to occupy the city's eastern suburbs. Al-Ma'mun's troops then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama. While al-Ma'mun was probably not implicated in the act, it was politically convenient, as it left him both de jure and de facto the legitimate caliph.\n\nSahlid dominance and reaction, 813\u2013819\n\nNevertheless, the regicide soured al-Ma'mun's victory. Tahir was soon transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa, but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty. According to Elton Daniel, \"It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs; For the first time, an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects\". As al-Ma'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital, a wave of Arab antipathy towards al-Ma'mun and his \"Persian\" supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad and surroundings, which feared being degraded to a mere province. This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl, who intended to permanently move the Muslim world's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan, where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups. Fadl was also responsible for side-lining many other supporters of al-Ma'mun; thus, when Harthama ibn A'yan went to Marv to inform al-Ma'mun of the real situation in the west, the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816. In response, Harthama's son Hatim led a short-lived revolt in Armenia.\n\nThe result of these policies was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across the Caliphate, with only Khurasan and the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire exempt from this turmoil. Iraq in particular descended into near-anarchy. The new governor of Iraq, Fadl's brother al-Hasan ibn Sahl, soon lost the support of the abna\u02be. The local population's alienation from his regime was exploited by the Zaydi Alids, who on 26 January 815 rose in revolt at Kufa, led by Abu'l-Saraya. The revolt spread quickly through Iraq region as various groups with old grievances against the Abbasids used the opportunity to exact revenge. The revolt was nominally led by the Alid Ibn Tabataba, and after his death by Zayd, a son of the imam Musa al-Kadhim who had been executed in 799 on Harun al-Rashid's orders. The uprising came close to threatening Baghdad itself, and it was only through the intervention of the capable Harthama that it was quelled, with Abu'l-Saraya being captured and executed in October. Secondary pro-Alid movements also seized control of Yemen (under Ibrahim al-Jazzar, another son of Musa al-Kadhim) and the Tihamah, including Mecca, where Muhammad al-Dibaj, a grandson of the Alid imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, was proclaimed anti-caliph in November 815. The suppression of these revolts was entrusted to Ali ibn Isa's son Hamdawayh, with an army of abna\u02be. Hamdawayh was successful in subduing these provinces, but then attempted, unsuccessfully, to secede from the Caliphate himself.\n\nIn 816, to bolster his flagging prestige, al-Ma'mun assumed the title \"God's Caliph\". Taking note of the widespread Alid support in his western provinces, al-Ma'mun not only spared the lives of the various Alid anti-caliphs, but on 24 March 817 also named the Alid Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, third son of Musa al-Kadhim, as his heir apparent, and even changed the official dynastic colour from Abbasid black to Alid green. Although the seriousness of al-Ma'mun's commitment to the Alid succession is uncertain\u2014there are suggestions that Ali al-Ridha was so old that he could hardly be expected to actually succeed al-Ma'mun\u2014its impact was disastrous: not only did it fail to produce any tangible popular support, but also provoked an uproar among the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad. Hasan ibn Sahl had already been forced to abandon the city, where various factional leaders now shared power, and the news of the Alid succession ruined his attempts at conciliation. Instead, on 17 July 817 the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad nominated a new Caliph of their own, Harun al-Rashid's younger brother Ibrahim. Ibrahim received broad backing from the Baghdad elites, from Abbasid princes like al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq (the future Caliph al-Mu'tasim, ) to old-established members of the bureaucracy like Fadl ibn al-Rabi (who returned to his office as hajib), and leaders of the abna\u02be. As the scholar Mohamed Rekaya commented, \"in other words, it was a revival of the war between the two camps [Baghdad and Khurasan], dormant since 813\".\n\nIbrahim moved to secure control of Iraq, but although he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, who had made Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Ridha succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although the rest of his family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Ridha also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad (\"the place of martyrdom\"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.\n\nIn the meantime, back in Baghdad, Ibrahim faced desertions, rebellions and conspiracies, one of which involved his half-brother al-Mansur. Hasan ibn Sahl was able to use this turmoil and advance north, capturing Mada'in. As the months passed, discontent in Baghdad grew. Ibrahim's supporters, including Fadl ibn al-Rabi, began abandoning him, and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al-Ma'mun's forces. Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy, Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding, opening the path for al-Ma'mun to reclaim Baghdad. On 17 August 819, al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad without resistance, and the political turmoil quickly subsided. Al-Ma'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition: he rescinded the Alid succession, restored black as the dynastic colour, sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement, and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqa. Al-Ma'mun did however retain the title of imam, which became part of the standard caliphal titulature.\n\nDuring the 812\u2013813 siege of Baghdad, Tahir had established close ties with the abna\u02be, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, and when he died in October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.\n\nReunification and pacification of the Caliphate, 820\u2013837\nAt the time al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from effective Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming various degrees of autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled the north of the country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was in the hands of a group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Adharbayjan and Armenia.\n\nTo face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun turned to another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, to whom he entrusted the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so that he had to be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824\u2013825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain the status quo, and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.\n\nElsewhere, however, the process of consolidation was harder, or failed completely: Aghlabid-controlled Ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status, effectively slipping entirely from Abbasid control, while in Adharbayjan, al-Ma'mun's general Isa ibn Abi Khalid re-established control over the various local Muslim lords in the cities, but was unable to suppress the Khurramite revolt. Expeditions were sent against the Khurramites under Sadaka ibn Ali al-Azdi in 824 and Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Ta'i in 827\u2013829, but both failed before the mountainous terrain and the Khurramites' guerrilla tactics, with Ibn Humayd losing his life as well. It was not until the accession of al-Mu'tasim, who employed his new military corps composed of Turkish slave-soldiers (mawali or ghilman) against the Khurramites, that their rebellion was suppressed in 837, after years of hard campaigning. Despite the restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces, the Caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions: the rest of al-Ma'mun's reign saw a series of uprisings by the Zutt in lower Iraq, a three-year revolt against oppressive taxation in Egypt in 829, in which both the Christian Copts and the Muslims participated, as well as the unsuccessful revolt of Ali ibn Hisham, Ibn Humayd's successor as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan.\n\nAftermath and impact\n\nThe long civil war shattered the social and political order of the early Abbasid state, and a new system began to emerge under al-Ma'mun, which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime: the abna\u02be, the old Arab families and the members of the Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units, often controlled by a hereditary dynasty, like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana, usually of Iranian descent. At the same time, however, al-Ma'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire, and counterbalanced them through the creation of two new military corps: his brother Abu Ishaq's Turkish slaves, and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier, which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq (al-Mu'tasim), who created a tightly controlled, centralized state, and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike. The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors, while the old Arab and Iranian elites were completely sidelined. Al-Ma'mun's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine: in 829, al-Ma'mun adopted Mu'tazilism, in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities.\n\nAt the same time, the willingness of al-Ma'mun and his successors to embrace the non-Arab populations of the Caliphate, especially in the Iranian East, as well as to entrust the governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy, helped to end a long series of religiously-motivated rebellions and reconciled these populations to Islam: the rate of conversion during al-Ma'mun's reign increased markedly, and that was the time when most of the local princely families of the Iranian lands finally became Muslims. As El-Hibri comments, \"in time this development represented a prelude to the emergence of autonomous provincial dynasties in the east, which would relate to the caliphal centre in nominal terms of loyalty only\".\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n \n\n \nIraq under the Abbasid Caliphate\n9th century in Iran\n9th century in the Abbasid Caliphate\nKhurasan under the Abbasid Caliphate\nWars of succession involving the states and peoples of Asia\n810s conflicts\n820s conflicts\nWars of succession involving the states and peoples of Africa", "machine_text": " Fourth Fitna The Fourth Fitna (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629) or the Fourth Islamic Civil War was a period of political and religious conflict and turmoil that lasted from the death of Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 until the defeat and death of the last claimant to the caliphate, Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya, in 683. The conflict was primarily between the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruled by the Umayyad dynasty, and the various Iraqi rebel movements that sought to overthrow them. The Umayyad victory was an important step in the Umayyad consolidation of power, and in the process, the displacement of the political and religious center of the Caliphate from the Hejaz to Syria. The term fitna is commonly used to refer to the various civil wars that afflicted the Islamic community in the wake of the Prophet Muhammad's death. The first fitna lasted from 656 until 661, the second fitna lasted from 683 until 685, the third fitna lasted from 686 until 692, and the fourth fitna lasted from 661 until 683. The causes of the fourth fitna were similar to those of the second and third fitnas, with the major causes being the tension between the executive and legislative branches of government, the concentration of power in the hands of the caliph, the failure of the caliph to meet the expectations of the ruled, economic and social hardships imposed by the ruling regime, and the desire of the ruled to share in the ruling elite's privileges. The fourth fitna was characterized by the fragmentation of the opposition to the Umayyads. Whereas the opposition during the second and third fitnas was primarily regional, during the fourth fitna it became primarily tribal. The tribes of Banu Tamim, Banu Qahtan, and Banu Asad were the most active in the conflict. The fourth fitna also featured the first instance of widespread ideological opposition to the Umayyads, in the form of the Kharijites, who opposed the Umayyads' accommodations to the non-Muslims and the elite's privilege. The first phase of the fourth fitna began with the murder of the Umayyad caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 and the subsequent struggle for the caliphate between the Umayyads and the Iraqis. The second phase began in 681 when the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya II died and was succeeded by his brother, Yazid II. The third phase began in 683 with the death of Yazid II and the appointment of his son, Mu'awiya III, to the caliphate. The fourth phase began in 684 when the Umayyad caliph, Marwan I, died and was succeeded by his son, Abd al-Malik. The fifth and final phase began in 685 when the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, died and was succeeded by his son, Walid I.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36645711}

Dissolving water in caustic soda liberated heat, which generated more steam from the boiler, until the caustic soda became too dilute to release heat at a useful temperature.\n\nTechnical description \nThese closed-loop steam engines had no firebox. The boiler was jacketed by a container loaded with about 5 tons of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). When water or steam came in contact with the caustic soda, it would generate heat \u2014 enough to actually run the boiler and generate more steam. Steam emanating from the boiler would be fed through pistons to propel the locomotive forward, and the exhaust steam from the pistons would be fed into the caustic soda to continue the cycle. These vehicles were virtually silent, because the steam was not released into the atmosphere.\n\nA soda locomotive could run for several hours, but eventually the soda would become diluted and wouldn't produce enough heat to continue generating steam. For reconcentrating, the caustic soda was either transferred out of the boiler of the locomotive and boiled in open vats, or, rather more conveniently, by injecting superheated steam at a high enough temperature to boil off the water in solution. A stationary boiler would be hooked up and feed superheated steam through the soda to boil off the water and effectively recharge the soda.\n\nThese locomotives were always called \"soda locomotives\" (sodium carbonate) although \"caustic soda locomotives\" (sodium hydroxide) would be a more precise description.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nebuchadnezzar II\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nebuchadnezzar II (Babylonian cuneiform:  Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur, meaning \"Nabu, watch over my heir\"; Biblical Hebrew:  N\u0259\u1e07\u016b\u1e35a\u1e0fne\u02be\u1e63\u1e63ar), also spelled Nebuchadrezzar II, was the second king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from the death of his father Nabopolassar in 605 BC to his own death in 562 BC. Historically known as Nebuchadnezzar the Great, he is typically regarded as the empire's greatest king. Nebuchadnezzar remains famous for his military campaigns in the Levant, for his construction projects in his capital, Babylon, and for the important part he played in Jewish history. Ruling for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar was the longest-reigning king of the Chaldean dynasty. At the time of his death, Nebuchadnezzar was among the most powerful rulers in the world.\n\nPossibly named after his grandfather of the same name, or after Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125\u20131104 BC), one of Babylon's greatest ancient warrior-kings, Nebuchadnezzar II already secured renown for himself during his father's reign, leading armies in the Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire. At the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar inflicted a crushing defeat on an Egyptian army led by Pharaoh Necho II, and ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would succeed the Neo-Assyrian Empire as the dominant power in the ancient Near East. Shortly after this victory, Nabopolassar died and Nebuchadnezzar became king. Despite his successful military career during his father's reign, the first third or so of Nebuchadnezzar's reign saw little to no major military achievements, and notably a disastrous failure in an attempted invasion of Egypt. These years of lacklustre military performance saw some of Babylon's vassals, particularly in the Levant, beginning to doubt Babylon's power, viewing the Neo-Babylonian Empire as a \"paper tiger\" rather than a power truly on the level of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The situation grew so severe that people in Babylonia itself began disobeying the king, some going as far as to revolt against Nebuchadnezzar's rule.\n\nAfter this disappointing early period as king, Nebuchadnezzar's luck turned. In the 580s BC, Nebuchadnezzar engaged in a successful string of military actions in the Levant against the vassal states in rebellion there, likely with the ultimate intent of curbing Egyptian influence in the region. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah, and its capital, Jerusalem. The destruction of Jerusalem led to the Babylonian captivity as the city's population, and people from the surrounding lands, were deported to Babylonia. The Jews thereafter referred to Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest enemy they had faced until that point, as a \"destroyer of nations\". The biblical Book of Jeremiah paints Nebuchadnezzar as a cruel enemy, but also as God's appointed ruler of the world and a divine instrument to punish disobedience. Through the destruction of Jerusalem, the capture of the rebellious Phoenician city of Tyre, and other campaigns in the Levant, Nebuchadnezzar completed the Neo-Babylonian Empire's transformation into the new great power of the ancient Near East.\n\nIn addition to his military campaigns, Nebuchadnezzar is remembered as a great builder-king. The prosperity ensured by his wars allowed Nebuchadnezzar to conduct great building projects in Babylon, and elsewhere in Mesopotamia. The modern image of Babylon is largely of the city as it was after Nebuchadnezzar's projects, during which he, among other work, rebuilt many of the city's religious buildings, including the Esagila and Etemenanki, repaired its current palace and constructed a brand new palace, and beautified its ceremonial centre through renovations to the city's Processional Street and the Ishtar Gate. As most of Nebuchadnezzar's inscriptions deal with his building projects, rather than military accomplishments, he was for a time seen by historians mostly as a builder, rather than a warrior.\n\nSources \nThere are very few cuneiform sources for the period between 594 BC and 557 BC, covering much of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, and the reigns of his three immediate successors; Amel-Marduk, Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk. This lack of sources has the unfortunate effect that even though Nebuchadnezzar had the longest reign of all of them, less is confidently known of Nebuchadnezzar's reign than of the reigns of almost all the other Neo-Babylonian kings. Though the handful of cuneiform sources recovered, notably the Babylonian Chronicle, confirm some events of his reign, such as conflicts with the Kingdom of Judah, other events, such as the 586 BC destruction of Solomon's Temple and other potential military campaigns Nebuchadnezzar conducted, are not covered in any known cuneiform documents.\n\nAs such, historical reconstructions of this period generally follow secondary sources in Hebrew, Greek and Latin to determine what events transpired at the time, in addition to contract tablets from Babylonia. Though using the sources written by later authors, many of them created several centuries after Nebuchadnezzar's time and often including their own cultural attitudes to the events and figures discussed, presents problems in and of itself, blurring the line between history and tradition, it is the only possible approach to gain insight into Nebuchadnezzar's reign.\n\nBackground\n\nAncestry and early life \n\nNebuchadnezzar was the eldest son of Nabopolassar (626\u2013605 BC), the founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. This is confirmed by Nabopolassar's inscriptions, which explicitly name Nebuchadnezzar as his \"eldest son\", as well as inscriptions from Nebuchadnezzar's reign, which refer to him as the \"first\" or \"chief son\" of Nabopolassar, and as Nabopolassar's \"true\" or \"legitimate heir\". The Neo-Babylonian Empire was founded through Nabopolassar's rebellion, and later war, against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which liberated Babylonia after nearly a century of Assyrian control. The war resulted in the complete destruction of Assyria, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which rose in its place, was powerful, but hastily built and politically unstable.\n\nAs Nabopolassar never clarified his ancestry in lineage in any of his inscriptions, his origin is not entirely clear. Subsequent historians have variously identified Nabopolassar as a Chaldean, an Assyrian or a Babylonian. Although no evidence conclusively confirms him as being of Chaldean origin, the term \"Chaldean dynasty\" is frequently used by modern historians for the royal family he founded, and the term \"Chaldean Empire\" remains in use as an alternate historiographical name for the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\n\nNabopolassar appears to, regardless of his ethnic origin, have been strongly connected to the city of Uruk, located south of Babylon. It is possible that he was a member of its ruling elite before becoming king and there is a growing body of evidence that Nabopolassar's family originated in Uruk, for instance that Nebuchadnezzar's daughters lived in the city. In 2007, Michael Jursa advanced the theory that Nabopolassar was a member of a prominent political family in Uruk, whose members are attested since the reign of Esarhaddon (681\u2013669 BC). To support his theory, Jursa pointed to how documents describe how the grave and body of \"Kudurru\", a deceased governor of Uruk, was desecrated due to the anti-Assyrian activities of Kudurru's two sons, Nabu-shumu-ukin and a son whose name is mostly missing. The desecration went so far as to drag Kudurru's body through the streets of Uruk. Kudurru can be identified with Nebuchadnezzar (Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur, \"Kudurru\" simply being a common and shortened nickname), a prominent official in Uruk who served as its governor under the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (669\u2013631 BC) in the 640s BC. In Assyrian tradition, the desecration of a dead body showed that the deceased individual and their surviving family were traitors and enemies of the state, and that they had to be completely eradicated, serving to punish them even after death. The name of the son whose name is unpreserved in the letter ended with either ahi, n\u00e2sir or u\u1e63ur, and the remaining traces can fit with the name Nab\u00fb-apla-u\u1e63ur, meaning that Nabopolassar could be the other son mentioned in the letter and thus a son of Kudurru.\n\nStrengthening this connection is that Nebuchadnezzar II is attested very early during his father's reign, from 626/625 to 617 BC, as high priest of the Eanna temple in Uruk, where he is often attested under the nickname \"Kudurru\". Nebuchadnezzar must have been made high priest at a very young age, considering that his year of death, 562 BC, is 64 years after 626 BC. The original Kudurru's second son, Nabu-shumu-ukin, also appears to be attested as a prominent general under Nabopolassar, and the name was also used by Nebuchadnezzar II for one of his sons, possibly honoring his dead uncle.\n\nName \n\nNebuchadnezzar II's name in Akkadian was Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur, meaning \"Nabu, watch over my heir\". The name was often interpreted in earlier scholarship as \"Nabu, protect the boundary\", given that the word kudurru can also mean 'boundary' or 'line'. Modern historians support the 'heir' interpretation over the 'boundary' interpretation in terms of this name. There is no reason to believe that the Babylonians intended the name to be difficult to interpret or to have a double meaning.\n\nNab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur is typically anglicised to 'Nebuchadnezzar', following how name is most commonly rendered in Hebrew and Greek, particularly in most of the Bible. In Hebrew, the name was rendered as \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05d0\u05e6\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8 (N\u0259\u1e07\u016b\u1e35a\u1e0fne\u02be\u1e63\u1e63ar) and in Greek it was rendered as \u039d\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c1 (Nabouchodonosor). Some scholars, such as Donald Wiseman, prefer the anglicisation \"Nebuchadrezzar\", with an \"r\" rather than an \"n\", following the assumption that \"Nebuchadnezzar\" is a later, corrupted form of the contemporary Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur. The alternate anglicisation \"Nebuchadrezzar\" derives from how the name is rendered in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05b6\u05d0\u05e6\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8 (N\u0259\u1e07\u016b\u1e35a\u1e0fre\u02be\u1e63\u1e63ar), a more faithful transliteration of the original Akkadian name. The Assyriologist Adrianus van Selms suggested in 1974 that the variant with an \"n\" rather than an \"r\" was a rude nickname, deriving from an Akkadian rendition like Nab\u00fb-k\u016bdanu-u\u1e63ur, which means 'Nabu, protect the mule', though there is no concrete evidence for this idea. Van Selms believed that a nickname like that could derive from Nebuchadnezzar's early reign, which was plagued by political instability.\n\nNebuchadnezzar II's name, Nab\u00fb-kudurri-u\u1e63ur, was identical to the name of his distant predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125\u20131104 BC), who ruled more than five centuries before Nebuchadnezzar II's time. Like Nebuchadnezzar II, Nebuchadnezzar I was a renowned warrior-king, who appeared in a time of political upheaval and defeated the forces of Babylon's enemies, in Nebuchadnezzar I's case the Elamites. Although theophoric names using the god Nabu are common in texts from the early Neo-Babylonian Empire, the name Nebuchadnezzar is relatively rare, only being mentioned four times with certainty. Though there is no evidence that Nabopolassar named his son after Nebuchadnezzar I, Nabopolassar was knowledgeable in history and actively worked to connect his rule to the rule of the Akkadian Empire, which preceded him by nearly two thousand years. The significance of his son and heir bearing the name of one of Babylon's greatest kings would not have been lost on Nabopolassar.\n\nIf Jursa's theory concerning Nabopolassar's origin is correct, it is alternatively possible that Nebuchadnezzar II was named after his grandfather of the same name, as the Babylonians employed patronymics, rather than after the previous king.\n\nNebuchadnezzar as crown prince \n\nNebuchadnezzar's military career began in the reign of his father, though little information survives. Based on a letter sent to the temple administration of the Eanna temple, it appears that Nebuchadnezzar participated in his father's campaign to take the city of Harran in 610 BC. Harran was the seat of Ashur-uballit II, who had rallied what remained of the Assyrian army and ruled what was left of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Babylonian victory in the Harran campaign, and the defeat of Ashur-uballit, in 609 BC marked the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Nebuchadnezzar also commanded an army in an unspecified mountainous region for several months in 607 BC.\n\nIn the war against the Babylonians and Medes, Assyria had allied with Pharaoh Psamtik I of Egypt, who had been interested in ensuring Assyria's survival so that Assyria could remain as a buffer state between his own kingdom and the Babylonian and Median kingdoms. After the fall of Harran, Psamtik's successor, Pharaoh Necho II, personally led a large army into former Assyrian lands to turn the tide of the war and restore the Neo-Assyrian Empire, even though it was more or less a lost cause as Assyria had already collapsed. As Nabopolassar was occupied with fighting the Kingdom of Urartu in the north, the Egyptians took control of the Levant largely unopposed, capturing territories as far north as the city of Carchemish in Syria, where Necho established his base of operations.\n\nNebuchadnezzar's greatest victory from his time as crown prince came at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, which put an end to Necho's campaign in the Levant by inflicting a crushing defeat on the Egyptians. Nebuchadnezzar had been the sole commander of the Babylonian army at this battle as his father had chosen to stay in Babylon, perhaps on account of illness. Necho's forces were completely annihilated by Nebuchadnezzar's army, with Babylonian sources claiming that not a single Egyptian escaped alive. The account of the battle in the Babylonian Chronicle reads as follows:\n\nThe story of Nebuchadnezzar's victory at Carchemish reverberated through history, appearing in many later ancient accounts, including in the Book of Jeremiah and the Books of Kings in the Bible. It is possible to conclude, based on subsequent geopolitics, that the victory resulted in all of Syria and Palestine coming under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a feat which the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III (745\u2013727 BC) only accomplished after five years of protracted military campaigns. The defeat of Egypt at Carchemish ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would grow to become the major power of the ancient Near East, and the uncontested successor of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nReign\n\nAccession to the throne \n\nNabopolassar died just a few weeks after Nebuchadnezzar's victory at Carchemish. At this point in time, Nebuchadnezzar was still away on his campaign against the Egyptians, having chased the retreating Egyptian forces to the region around the city of Hamath. The news of Nabopolassar's death reached Nebuchadnezzar's camp on 8 Abu (late July), and Nebuchadnezzar quickly arranged affairs with the Egyptians and rushed back to Babylon, where he was proclaimed king on 1 Ul\u016blu (mid-August). The speed in which Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon might be due to the threat that one of his brothers (two are known by name: Nabu-shum-lishir and Nabu-zer-ushabshi) could claim the throne in his absence. Though Nebuchadnezzar had been recognised as the eldest son and heir by Nabopolassar, Nabu-shum-lishir, Nabopolassar's second-born son, had been recognised as \"his equal brother\", a dangerously vague title. Despite these possible fears, there were no attempts made at usurping his throne at this time.\n\nOne of Nebuchadnezzar's first acts as king was to bury his father. Nabopolassar was laid in a huge coffin, adorned with ornamented gold plates and fine dresses with golden beads, which was then placed within a small palace he had constructed in Babylon. Shortly thereafter, before the end of the month in which he had been crowned, Nebuchadnezzar returned to Syria to resume his campaign. The Babylonian Chronicle records that \"he marched about victoriously\" (meaning that he faced little to no resistance), returning to Babylon after several months of campaigning. The Syrian campaign, though it resulted in a certain amount of plunder, was not a complete success in that it did not ensure Nebuchadnezzar's grasp on the region. He had seemingly failed to inspire fear, given that none of the westernmost states in the Levant swore fealty to him and paid tribute.\n\nEarly military campaigns \n\nThough little information survives concerning them, the Babylonian Chronicle preserves brief accounts of Nebuchadnezzar's military activities in his first eleven years as king. In 604 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant once again, conquering the city of Ashkelon. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Ashkelon's king was captured and taken to Babylon, and the city was plundered and levelled to the ground. Modern excavations at Ashkelon have confirmed that the city was more or less destroyed at this point in time. The Ashkelon campaign was preceded by a campaign in Syria, which was more successful than Nebuchadnezzar's first, resulting in oaths of fealty from the rulers of Phoenicia.\n\nIn 603 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in a land whose name is not preserved in the surviving copy of the chronicle. The chronicle records that this campaign was extensive, given that the account mentions the construction of large siege towers and a siege of a city, the name of which does not survive either. Anson Rainey speculated in 1975 that the city taken was Gaza, whereas Nadav Na'aman thought in 1992 that it was Kummuh in south-eastern Anatolia. In the second half of the 5th century BC, some documents mentioned the towns Isqalanu (the name derived from Ashkelon) and Hazzatu (the name possibly derived from Gaza) near the city of Nippur, indicating that deportees from both of these cities lived near Nippur, and as such possibly that they had been captured at around the same time.\n\nIn both 602 BC and 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant, though little information survives beyond that a \"vast\" amount of booty was brought from the Levant to Babylonia in 602 BC. On account of the entry for 602 BC also referring to Nabu-shum-lishir, Nebuchadnezzar's younger brother, in a fragmentary and unclear context, it is possible that Nabu-shum-lishir led a revolt against his brother in an attempt to usurp the throne in that year, especially since he is no longer mentioned in any sources after 602 BC. The damage to the text however makes this idea speculative and conjectural.\n\nIn the 601 BC campaign, Nebuchadnezzar departed from the Levant and then marched into Egypt. Despite the defeat at Carchemish in 605 BC, Egypt still had a great amount of influence in the Levant, even though the region was ostensibly under Babylonian rule. Thus, a campaign against Egypt was logical in order to assert Babylonian dominance, and also carried enormous economic and propagandistic benefits, but it was also risky and ambitious. The path into Egypt was difficult, and the lack of secure control of either side of the Sinai Desert could spell disaster. Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Egypt did fail\u2013the Babylonian Chronicle states that both the Egyptian and Babylonian armies suffered a huge number of casualties. Though Egypt was not conquered, the campaign did result in momentarily curbing Egyptian interest in the Levant, given that Necho II gave up his ambitions in the region. In 599 BC, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army into the Levant and then attacked and raided the Arabs in the Syrian desert. Though apparently successful, it is unclear what the achievements gained in this campaign were.\n\nIn 598 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against the Kingdom of Judah, succeeding in capturing the city of Jerusalem. Judah represented a prime target of Babylonian attention given that it was at the epicenter of competition between Babylon and Egypt. By 601 BC, Judah's king, Jehoiakim, had begun to openly challenge Babylonian authority, counting on that Egypt would lend support to his cause. Nebuchadnezzar's first, 598\u2013597 BC, assault on Jerusalem is recorded in the Bible, but also in the Babylonian Chronicle, which describes it as follows:\n\nJehoiakim had died during Nebuchadnezzar's siege and been replaced by his son, Jeconiah, who was captured and taken to Babylon, with his uncle Zedekiah installed in his place as king of Judah. Jeconiah is recorded as being alive in Babylonia thereafter, with records as late as 592 or 591 BC listing him among the recipients of food at Nebuchadnezzar's palace and still referring to him as the 'king of the land of Judah'.\n\nIn 597 BC, the Babylonian army departed for the Levant again, but appears to not have engaged in any military activities as they turned back immediately after reaching the Euphrates. The following year, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army along the Tigris river to do battle with the Elamites, but no actual battle happened as the Elamites retreated out of fear once Nebuchadnezzar was a day's march away. In 595 BC, Nebuchadnezzar stayed at home in Babylon but soon had to face a rebellion against his rule there, though he defeated the rebels, with the chronicle stating that the king \"put his large army to the sword and conquered his foe.\" Shortly thereafter, Nebuchadnezzar again campaigned in the Levant and secured large amounts of tribute. In the last year recorded in the chronicle, 594 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant yet again.\n\nThere were several years without any noteworthy military activity at all. Notably, Nebuchadnezzar spent all of 600 BC in Babylon, when the chronicle excuses the king by stating that he stayed in Babylon to \"refit his numerous horses and chariotry\". Some of the years when Nebuchadnezzar was victorious can also hardly be considered real challenges. Raiding the Arabs in 599 BC was not a major military accomplishment and the victory over Judah and the retreat of the Elamites were not secured on the battlefield. It thus appears that Nebuchadnezzar achieved little military success after the failure of his invasion of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar's poor military record had dangerous geopolitical consequences. If the biblical record is to be believed, in Zedekiah's fourth year as king of Judah (594 BC), the kings of Ammon, Edom, Moab, Sidon and Tyre met in Jerusalem to deal with the possibility of throwing off Babylonian control. Evidence that Babylonian control was beginning to unravel is also clear from contemporary Babylonian records, such as the aforementioned rebellion in Babylonia itself, as well as records of a man being executed in 594 BC at Borspippa for \"breaking his oath to the king\". The oath-breaking was serious enough that the judge in the trial was Nebuchadnezzar himself. It is also possible that Babylonian\u2013Median relations were becoming strained, with records of a \"Median defector\" being housed in Nebuchadnezzar's palace and some inscriptions indicating that the Medes were beginning to be seen as \"enemies\". By 594 BC, the failure of the Egyptian invasion, and the lacklustre state of Nebuchadnezzar's other campaigns, loomed high. According to the Assyriologist Israel Eph\u02bfal, Babylon at this time was seen by its contemporaries more like a \"paper tiger\" (i. e. an ineffectual threat) than a great empire, like Assyria just a few decades prior.\n\nDestruction of Jerusalem \n\nFrom his appointment as king of Judah, Zedekiah waited for the opportune moment to throw off Babylonian control. After Pharaoh Necho II's death in 595 BC, Egyptian intervention in affairs in the Levant increased once again under his successors, Psamtik II (595\u2013589 BC) and Apries (589\u2013570 BC), who both worked to encourage anti-Babylonian rebellions. It is possible that the Babylonian failure to invade Egypt in 601 BC helped inspire revolts against the Babylonian Empire. The outcome of these efforts was Zedekiah's open revolt against Nebuchadnezzar's authority. Unfortunately, no cuneiform sources are preserved from this time and the only known account of the fall of Judah is the biblical account.\n\nIn 589 BC, Zedekiah refused to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar, and he was closely followed in this by Ithobaal III, the king of Tyre. In response to Zedekiah's uprising, Nebuchadnezzar conquered and destroyed the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BC, one of the great achievements of his reign. The campaign, which probably ended in the summer of 586 BC, resulted in the plunder and destruction of the city of Jerusalem, a permanent end to Judah, and it led to the Babylonian captivity, as the Jews were captured and deported to Babylonia. Archaeological excavations confirm that Jerusalem and the surrounding area was destroyed and depopulated. It is possible that the intensity of the destruction carried out by Nebuchadnezzar at Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Levant was due to the implementation of something akin to a scorched earth-policy, aimed at stopping Egypt from gaining a foothold there.\n\nSome Jewish administration was allowed to remain in the region under the governor Gedaliah, governing from Mizpah under close Babylonian monitoring. According to the Bible, and the 1st-century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Zedekiah attempted to flee after resisting the Babylonians, but was captured at Jericho and suffered a terrible fate. According to the narrative, Nebuchadnezzar wanted to make an example out of him given that Zedekiah was not an ordinary vassal, but a vassal directly appointed by Nebuchadnezzar. As such, Zedekiah was supposedly taken to Riblah in northern Syria, where he had to watch his sons being executed before having his eyes gouged out and sent to be imprisoned in Babylon.\n\nPer the Books of Kings in the Bible, the campaign against Judah was longer than typical Mesopotamian wars, with the siege of Jerusalem lasting 18\u201330 months (depending on the calculation), rather than the typical length of less than a year. Whether the unusual length of the siege indicates that the Babylonian army was weak, unable to break into the city for more than a year, or that Nebuchadnezzar by this time had succeeded in stabilising his rule in Babylonia and could thus wage war patiently without being pressured by time to escalate the siege, is not certain.\n\nLater military campaigns \n\nIt is possible that the Egyptians took advantage of the Babylonians being preoccupied with besieging Jerusalem. Herodotus describes Pharaoh Apries as campaigning in the Levant, taking the city of Sidon and fighting the Tyrians, which indicates a renewed Egyptian invasion of the Levant. Apries is unlikely to have been as successful as Herodotus describes, given that it is unclear how the Egyptian navy would have defeated the superior navies of the Phoenician cities, and even if some cities had been taken, they must have shortly thereafter fallen into Babylonian hands again. Tyre had rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar at around the same time as Judah, and Nebuchadnezzar moved to retake the city after his successful subduing of the Jews.\n\nThe biblical Book of Ezekiel describes Tyre in 571 BC as if it had been recently captured by the Babylonian army. The supposed length of the siege, 13 years, is only given by Flavius Josephus, and is subject to debate among modern scholars. Josephus's account of Nebuchadnezzar's reign is obviously not entirely historic, as he describes Nebuchadnezzar as, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, invading Egypt, capturing the Pharaoh and appointing another Pharaoh in his place. Josephus states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in the seventh year of \"his\" reign, though it is unclear whether \"his\" in this context refers to Nebuchadnezzar or to Ithobaal III of Tyre. If it refers to Nebuchadnezzar, a siege begun in 598 BC and lasting for thirteen years, later simultaneously with the siege of Jerusalem, is unlikely to have gone unmentioned in Babylonian records. If the seventh year of Ithobaal is intended, the beginning of the siege may conjecturally be placed after Jerusalem's fall. If the siege lasting 13 years is taken at face value, the siege would then not have ended before 573 or 572 BC. The supposed length of the siege can be ascribed to the difficulty in besieging the city: Tyre was located on an island 800 metres from the coast, and could not be taken without naval support. Though the city withstood numerous sieges, it would not be captured until Alexander the Great's siege in 332 BC.\n\nIn the end, the siege was resolved without a need of battle and did not result in the Tyre being conquered. It seems Tyre's king and Nebuchadnezzar came to an agreement for Tyre to continue to be ruled by vassal kings, though probably under heavier Babylonian control than before. Documents from Tyre near the end of Nebuchadnezzar's reign demonstrate that the city had become a centre for Babylonian military affairs in the region. According to later Jewish tradition, it is possible that Ithobaal III was deposed and taken as a prisoner to Babylon, with another king, Baal II, proclaimed by Nebuchadnezzar in his place.\n\nIt is possible that Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against Egypt in 568 BC, given that a fragmentary Babylonian inscription, given the modern designation BM 33041, from that year records the word \"Egypt\" as well as possibly traces of the name \"Amasis\" (the name of the then incumbent Pharaoh, Amasis II, 570\u2013526 BC). A stele of Amasis, also fragmentary, may also describe a combined naval and land attack by the Babylonians. The evidence for this campaign is scant however, and the readings of the relevant inscriptions are not certain. If Nebuchadnezzar did campaign against Egypt again, he was unsuccessful again, given that Egypt did not come under Babylonian rule.\n\nNebuchadnezzar's campaigns in the Levant, most notably those directed towards Jerusalem and Tyre, completed the Neo-Babylonian Empire's transformation from a rump state of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to the new dominant power of the ancient Near East. Still, Nebuchadnezzar's military accomplishments can be questioned, given that the borders of his empire, by the end of his reign, had not noticeably increased in size and that his main rival, Egypt, had not submitted to his rule. Even after a reign of several decades, Nebuchadnezzar's greatest victory remained his victory over the Egyptians at Carchemish in 605 BC, before he even became king.\n\nBuilding projects \n\nThe Babylonian king was traditionally a builder and restorer, and as such large-scale building projects were important as a legitimizing factor for Babylonian rulers. Nebuchadnezzar extensively expanded and rebuilt his capital city of Babylon and the most modern historical and archaeological interpretations of the city reflect it as it appeared after Nebuchadnezzar's construction projects. The projects were made possible through the prospering economy during Nebuchadnezzar's reign, sustained by his conquests. His building inscriptions record work done to numerous temples, notably the restoration of the Esagila, the main temple of Babylon's national deity Marduk, and the completion of the Etemenanki, a great ziggurat dedicated to Marduk.\n\nExtensive work was also conducted on civil and military structures. Among the most impressive efforts was the work done surrounding the city's northern ceremonial entrance, the Ishtar Gate. These projects included restoration work on the South Palace, inside the city walls, the construction of a completely new North Palace, on the other side of the walls facing the gate, as well as the restoration of Babylon's Processional Street, which led through the gate, and of the gate itself. The ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's North Palace are poorly preserved and as such its structure and appearance are not entirely understood. Nebuchadnezzar also constructed a third palace, the Summer Palace, built some distance north of the inner city walls in the northernmost corner of the outer walls.\n\nThe restored Ishtar Gate was decorated with blue and yellow glazed bricks and depictions of bulls (symbols of the god Adad) and dragons (symbols of the god Marduk). Similar bricks were used for the walls surrounding the Processional Street, which also featured depictions of lions (symbols of the goddess Ishtar). Babylon's Processional Street, the only such street yet excavated in Mesopotamia, ran along the eastern walls of the South Palace and exited the inner city walls at the Ishtar Gate, running past the North Palace. To the south, this street went by the Etemenanki, turning to the west and going over a bridge constructed either under the reign of Nabopolassar or Nebuchadnezzar. Some of the bricks of the Processional Street bear the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (705\u2013681 BC) on their underside, perhaps indicating that construction of the street had begun already during his reign, but the fact that the upper side of the bricks all bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar suggests that construction of the street was completed under Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Glazed bricks such as the ones used in the Procession Street were also used in the throne room of the South Palace, which was decorated with depictions of lions and tall, stylized palm trees.\n\nNebuchadnezzar also directed building efforts on the city of Borsippa, with several of his inscriptions recording restoration work on that city's temple, the Ezida, dedicated to the god Nabu. Additionally, Nebuchadnezzar also restored the ziggurat of the Ezida, the E-urme-imin-anki, and also worked on the temple of Gula, Etila, as well as numerous other temples and shrines in the city. Nebuchadnezzar also repaired Borsippa's walls.\n\nOther great building projects by Nebuchadnezzar include the Nar-Shamash, a canal to bring water from the Euphrates close to the city of Sippar, and the Median Wall, a large defensive structure built to defend Babylonia against incursions from the north. The Median Wall was one of two walls built to protect Babylonia's northern border. Further evidence that Nebuchadnezzar believed the north to be the most likely point of attack for his enemies comes from that he fortified the walls of northern cities, such as Babylon, Borsippa and Kish, but left the walls of southern cities, such as Ur and Uruk, as they were. Nebuchadnezzar also began work on the Royal Canal, also known as Nebuchadnezzar's Canal, a great canal linking the Euphrates to the Tigris which in time completely transformed the agriculture of the region, but the structure was not completed until the reign of Nabonidus, who ruled as the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 556 to 539 BC.\n\nDeath and succession \nNebuchadnezzar died at Babylon in 562 BC. The last known tablet dated to Nebuchadnezzar's reign, from Uruk, is dated to the same day, 7 October, as the first known tablet of his successor, Amel-Marduk, from Sippar. Amel-Marduk's administrative duties probably began before he became king, during the last few weeks or months of his father's reign when Nebuchadnezzar was ill and dying. Having ruled for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar's reign was the longest of his dynasty and he would be remembered favourably by the Babylonians.\n\nAmel-Marduk's accession does not appear to have gone smoothly. Amel-Marduk was not the eldest living son of Nebuchadnezzar and the reason why he was picked as crown prince is not known. The choice is especially strange given that some sources suggest that the relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Amel-Marduk was particularly poor, with one surviving text describing both as parties in some form of conspiracy and accusing one of them (the text is too fragmentary to determine which one) of failing in the most important duties of Babylonian kingship through exploiting Babylon's populace and desecrating its temples. Amel-Marduk also at one point appears to have been imprisoned by his father, possibly on account of the Babylonian aristocracy having proclaimed him as king while Nebuchadnezzar was away. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar intended to replace Amel-Marduk as heir with another son, but died before doing so.\n\nIn one of Nebuchadnezzar's late inscriptions, written more than forty years into his reign, he wrote that he had been chosen for the kingship by the gods before he was even born. Mesopotamian rulers typically only stressed divine legitimacy in this fashion when their actual legitimacy was questionable, a method often employed by usurpers. Given that Nebuchadnezzar at this point had been king for several decades and was the legitimate heir of his predecessor, the inscription is very strange, unless it was intended to help legitimize Nebuchadnezzar's successor, Amel-Marduk, who as a younger son and a former conspirator could be seen as politically problematic.\n\nFamily and children \n\nNo surviving contemporary Babylonian documents provide the name of Nebuchadnezzar's wife. According to Berossus, her name was Amytis, daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. Berossus writes that '[Nabopolassar] sent troops to the assistance of Astyages, the tribal chieftain and satrap of the Medes in order to obtain a daughter of Astyages, Amyitis, as wife for his son [Nebuchadnezzar]'. Though the ancient Greek historian Ctesias instead wrote that Amytis was the name of a daughter of Astyages who had married Cyrus I of Persia, it seems more likely that a Median princess would marry a member of the Babylonian royal family, considering the good relations established between the two during Nabopolassar's reign. Given that Astyages was still too young during Nabopolassar's reign to already have children, and was not yet king, it seems more probable that Amytis was Astyages's sister, and thus a daughter of his predecessor, Cyaxares. By marrying his son to a daughter of Cyaxares, Nebuchadnezzar's father Nabopolassar likely sought to seal the alliance between the Babylonians and the Medes. According to tradition, Nebuchadnezzar constructed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, featuring exotic shrubs, vines and trees as well as artificial hills, watercourses and knolls, so that Amytis would feel less homesick for the mountains of Media. No archaeological evidence for these gardens has yet been found.\n\nNebuchadnezzar had six known sons. Most of the sons, with the exceptions of Marduk-nadin-ahi and Eanna-sharra-usur, are attested very late in their father's reign. It is possible that they might have been the product of a second marriage and that they could have been born relatively late in Nebuchadnezzar's reign, possibly after his known daughters. The known sons of Nebuchadnezzar are:\n\n Marduk-nadin-ahi (Akkadian: Marduk-n\u0101din-a\u1e2bi) \u2013 the earliest attested of Nebuchadnezzar's children, attested in a legal document, probably as an adult as he is described as being in charge of his own land, already in Nebuchadnezzar's third year as king (602/601 BC). Presumably Nebuchadnezzar's firstborn son, if not eldest child, and thus his legitimate heir. He is also attested very late in Nebuchadnezzar's reign, named as a \"royal prince\" in a document recording the purchase of dates by Sin-m\u0101r-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur, his servant, in 563 BC.\nEanna-sharra-usur (Akkadian: Eanna-\u0161arra-u\u1e63ur) \u2013 named as a \"royal prince\" among sixteen people in a document at Uruk from 587 BC recorded as receiving barley \"for the sick\".\nAmel-Marduk (Akkadian: Am\u0113l-Marduk), originally named Nabu-shum-ukin (Nab\u00fb-\u0161um-uk\u012bn) \u2013 succeeded Nebuchadnezzar as king in 562 BC. His reign was marred with intrigues and he only ruled for two years before being murdered and usurped by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar. Later Babylonian sources mostly speak ill of his reign. Amel-Marduk is first attested, notably as crown prince, in a document 566 BC. Given that Amel-Marduk had an older brother in Marduk-nadin-ahi, alive as late as 563 BC, why he was named crown prince is not clear.\n Marduk-shum-usur (Akkadian: Marduk-\u0161um-u\u1e63ur or Marduk-\u0161uma-u\u1e63ur) \u2013 named as a \"royal prince\" in documents from Nebuchadnezzar's 564 BC and 562 BC years, recording payments by his scribe to the Ebabbar temple in Sippar.\n Mushezib-Marduk (Akkadian: Mu\u0161\u0113zib-Marduk) \u2013 named as a \"royal prince\" once in a contract tablet from 563 BC.\nMarduk-nadin-shumi (Akkadian: Marduk-n\u0101din-\u0161umi) \u2013 named as a \"royal prince\" once in a contract tablet from 563 BC.\nThree of Nebuchadnezzar's daughters are known by name:\n\n Kashshaya (Akkadian: Ka\u0161\u0161aya) \u2013 attested in several economic documents from Nebuchadnezzar's reign as \"the king's daughter\". Her name is of unclear origin; it might be derived from the word ka\u0161\u0161\u00fb (kassite). Kashshaya is attested from contemporary texts as a resident of (and landowner in) Uruk. Kashshaya is typically, although speculatively, identified as the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar who married Neriglissar.\n Innin-etirat (Akkadian: Innin-\u0113\u1e6dirat) \u2013 attested as \"the king's daughter\" in a 564 BC document which records her granting m\u0101r-ban\u00fbtu status (\"status of a free man\") to a slave by the name Nab\u00fb-mukk\u00ea-elip. The document in question was written at Babylon, but names including the divine prefix Innin are almost unique to Uruk, suggesting that she was a resident of that city.\n Ba'u-asitu (Akkadian: Ba'u-as\u012btu) \u2013 attested as the owner of a piece of real estate in an economic document. The precise reading and meaning of her name is somewhat unclear. Paul-Alain Beaulieu, who in 1998 published the translated text which confirms her existence, believes that her name is best interpreted as meaning \"Ba'u is a/the physician\". The document was written at Uruk, where Ba'u-asitu is presumed to have lived.\nIt is possible that one of Nebuchadnezzar's daughters married the high official Nabonidus. Marriage to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar could explain how Nabonidus could became king, and also explain why certain later traditions, such as the Book of Daniel in the Bible, describe Nabonidus's son, Belshazzar, as Nebuchadnezzar's son (descendant). Alternatively, these later traditions might instead derive from royal propaganda. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the \"last great queen\" of the Babylonian Empire as \"Nitocris\", though that name (nor any other name) is not attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. Herodotus's description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material that makes it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus's wife or mother, but William H. Shea proposed in 1982 that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus's wife and Belshazzar's mother.\n\nLegacy\n\nAssessment by historians \nBecause of the scarcity of sources, assessment by historians of Nebuchadnezzar's character and the nature of his reign have differed considerably over time. He has typically been regarded as the greatest and most prestigious king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. \n\nSince military activity was not a major issue described in the inscriptions of any Neo-Babylonian king regardless of their actual military accomplishments, in sharp contrast to the inscriptions of their Neo-Assyrian predecessors, Nebuchadnezzar's own inscriptions talk very little about his wars. Out of the fifty or so known inscriptions by the king, only a single one deals with military action, and in this case only small-scale conflicts in the Lebanon region. Many Assyriologists, such as Wolfram von Soden in 1954, thus initially assumed that Nebuchadnezzar had mainly been a builder-king, devoting his energy and efforts to building and restoring his country. A major change in evaluations of Nebuchadnezzar came with the publication of the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle by Donald Wiseman in 1956, which cover the geopolitical events of Nebuchadnezzar's first eleven years as king. From the publication of these tablets and onwards, historians have shifted to perceiving Nebuchadnezzar as a great warrior, devoting special attention to the military achievements of his reign.\n\nAccording to the historian Josette Elayi, writing in 2018, Nebuchadnezzar is somewhat difficult to characterise on account of the scarcity of Babylonian source material. Elayi wrote, about Nebuchadnezzar, that \"He was a conqueror, even though reservations can be had about his military capabilities. There was no lack of statesmanlike qualities, given his success in building the Babylonian Empire. He was a great builder, who restored a country that for a long time had been devastated by war. That is roughly all we know about him because the Babylonian Chronicles and other texts say little about his personality.\"\n\nIn Jewish and biblical tradition \n\nThe Babylonian captivity initiated by Nebuchadnezzar came to an end with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. Within a year of their liberation, the captured Jews returned to their homeland. Their liberation did little to erase the memory of five decades of imprisonment and oppression. Instead, Jewish literary accounts ensured that accounts of the hardship endured by the Jews, as well as the monarch responsible for it, would be remembered for all time. The Book of Jeremiah calls Nebuchadnezzar a \"lion\" and a \"destroyer of nations\".\n\nNebuchadnezzar's story thus found its way into the Old Testament of the Bible. The Bible narrates how Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah, besieged, plundered and destroyed Jerusalem, and how he took away the Jews in captivity, portraying him as a cruel enemy of the Jewish people. The Bible also portrays Nebuchadnezzar as the legitimate ruler of all the nations of the world, appointed to rule the world by God. As such, Judah, through divine ruling, should have obeyed Nebuchadnezzar and not rebelled. Nebuchadnezzar is also depicted as carrying out death sentences pronounced by God, slaying two false prophets. Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns of conquest against other nations are portrayed as being in-line with God's will for Nebuchadnezzar's dominance.Despite Nebuchadnezzar's negative portrayal, he is notably referred with the epithet 'my servant' (i.e. God's servant) in three places in the Book of Jeremiah. Nebuchadnezzar's attack on the Kingdom of Judah is theologically justified in the Book of Jeremiah on account of its populace's 'disobedience' of God, and the king is called \"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant\". The Book of Jeremiah also states that God has made all the Earth and given it to whom it seemed proper to give it to, deciding upon giving all of the lands of the world to \"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant\". The Book of Jeremiah also prophesises Nebuchadnezzar's victory over Egypt, stating that \"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant\" will invade Egypt and \"deliver to death those appointed for death, and to captivity those appointed for captivity, and to the sword those appointed for the sword\". Given that Nebuchadnezzar was the enemy of what the Bible proclaims as God's chosen people, possibly the worst enemy they had faced until this point, there must be a special reason for referring to him with the epithet \"my servant\". Other uses of this epithet are usually limited to some of the most positively portrayed figures, such as the various prophets, Jacob (the symbol of the chosen people) and David (the chosen king). Klaas A. D. Smelik noted in 2004 that \"in the Hebrew Bible, there is no better company conceivable than these; at the same time, there is no candidate less likely for this title of honour than the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar\". It is possible that the epithet is a later addition, as it is missing in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, perhaps added after Nabuchadnezzar began to be seen in a slightly more favourable light than immediately after Jerusalem's destruction. Alternatively, possible theological explanations include Nebuchadnezzar, despite his cruelty, being seen as an instrument in fulfilling God's universal plan, or perhaps that designating him as a \"servant\" of God was to show that readers should not fear Nebuchadnezzar, but his true master, God.\n\nIn the Book of Daniel, recognised by scholars as a work of historical fiction, Nebuchadnezzar is given a portrayal that differs considerably from his portrayal in the Book of Jeremiah. He is for the most part depicted as a merciless and despotic ruler. The king has a nightmare, and asks his wisemen, including Daniel and his three companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, to interpret the dream, but refuses to state the dream's contents. When the servants protest, Nebuchadnezzar sentences all of them (including Daniel and his companions) to death. By the end of the story, when Daniel successfully interpreted the dream, Nebuchadnezzar is nevertheless shown to be very grateful, showering Daniel with gifts, making him the governor of the \"province of Babylon\" and making him the chief of the kingdoms' wisemen. A second story again casts Nebuchadnezzar as a tyrannical and pagan king, who after Daniel and his companions refuse to worship a newly erected golden statue sentences them to death through being thrown into a furnace. After Daniel interprets another dream as meaning that Nebuchadnezzar will lose his mind and live like an animal for seven years before being restored to his normal state, Nebuchadnezzar saves Daniel and his companions from their fiery fate and acknowledges Daniel's god as the \"lord of kings\" and \"god of gods\". Though Nebuchadnezzar is also mentioned as acknowledging the Jewish god as the true god in other passages of the Book of Daniel, it is apparent that his supposed conversion to Judaism does not change his violent character, given that he proclaims that anyone who speaks amiss of God \"shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill\". The portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel is a fickle tyrant who is not particularly consistent in his faith, far from the typical \"servants of God\" in other books of the Bible.\n\nGiven that Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as the father of Belshazzar in the Book of Daniel, it is probable that this portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar, especially the story of his madness, was actually based on Belshazzar's real father, Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (556\u2013539 BC). Separate Jewish and Hellenistic traditions exist concerning Nabonidus having been mad, and it is likely that this madness was simply reattributed to Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel through conflation. Some later traditions conflated Nebuchadnezzar with other rulers as well, such as the Assyrian Ashurbanipal (669\u2013631 BC), the Persian Artaxerxes III (358\u2013338 BC), the Seleucids Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175\u2013164 BC) and Demetrius I Soter (161\u2013150 BC) and the Armenian Tigranes the Great (95\u201355 BC). The apocryphal Book of Judith, which probably applies the name Nebuchadnezzar to Tigranes the Great of Armenia, refers to Nebuchadnezzar as a king of the Assyrians, rather than Babylonians, and demonstrates that Nebuchadnezzar was still viewed as an evil king, responsible for destroying Jerusalem, looting its temple, taking the Jews hostage in Babylon, and for the various misdeeds ascribed to him in later Jewish writings.\n\nTitles \n\nIn most of his inscriptions, Nebuchadnezzar is typically only titled as \"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon\" or \"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the one who provides for Esagil and Ezida, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon\". In economic documents, Nebuchadnezzar is also ascribed the ancient title \"king of the Universe\", and he sometimes also used the title \"king of Sumer and Akkad\", used by all the Neo-Babylonian kings. Some inscriptions accord Nebuchadnezzar more elaborate version of his titles, including the following variant, attested in an inscription from Babylon:\n\nSee also \n List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources\nNebuchadnezzar (Blake) \u2013 famous 19th-century painting depicting the biblical story of Nebuchadnezzar's madness\nNabucco \u2013 19th-century opera by Giuseppe Verdi based loosely on the biblical story of Nebuchadnezzar\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nWeb sources \n\n \n\n \n630s BC births\n560s BC deaths\nYear of birth uncertain\nYear of death uncertain\n7th-century BC Babylonian kings\n6th-century BC Babylonian kings\n6th-century BC biblical rulers\n7th-century BC biblical rulers\nBabylonian kings\nBook of Daniel people\nBabylonian captivity\nMonarchs of the Hebrew Bible\nChaldean kings\nKings of the Universe\nChaldean dynasty\n7th-century BC religious leaders\n6th-century BC religious leaders", "machine_text": " Nebuchadnezzar II (reigned 604\u2013562 BC), was the second king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

He is best known for his military campaigns and the building projects he initiated, especially the expansion of the city of Babylon, the construction of the hanging gardens, and the creation of the damaging Drought Relief Service. Under Nebuchadnezzar II, Babylonia reached the height of its power and wealth. He was known for his building programs, which were on a monumental scale: he is known to have commissioned the construction of the hanging gardens of Babylon, the Statue of Marduk, and the Ishtar Gate, among other works. The city of Babylon itself grew to be one of the largest cities of the ancient world, second only to Rome, and was home to a diverse mix of people, religions, and cultures. Nebuchadnezzar was also a great warrior who led several military campaigns against the Egyptians, the Persians, and the Greeks. He was able to expand the Babylonian Empire to its greatest extent, and his campaigns brought vast amounts of wealth to the empire. However, he was also known for his cruelty, and he is said to have executed thousands of people, including his own family members. Despite his many accomplishments, Nebuchadnezzar II is best known for the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews to Babylon. In 587 BC, he attacked the Kingdom of Judah and captured the city of Jerusalem, destroying the Temple of Jerusalem and exiling the Jewish people to Babylon. This event had a profound impact on the history of the Jewish people and the development of their religion, and it is remembered as one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East. Nebuchadnezzar II was a powerful and influential king who played a key role in the history of the ancient world. He was a builder, a warrior, and a conqueror, and his legacy lives on today as one of the most important rulers of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52346}

The genus includes the species Cineraria filiformis, Cineraria lanata, Cineraria purpurata, Cineraria rosea, Cineraria saccharata, Cineraria silvestris, Cineraria squalida, and Cineraria thomasiifolia. Cineraria filiformis is the type species. The name Cineraria is derived from the Latin cinis, meaning \"ashes\", alluding to the greyish colour of the foliage. These are annual or biennial plants, 15\u201360 cm (6\u201324 in) tall, with Alternate leaves, basal and cauline, imparipinnate, with margins either undulate or crisped. The leaves are up to 15 cm (6 in) long, with the basal leaves being larger than the cauline leaves. The flowers are in a corymbiform inflorescence, with ray florets in shades of white, pink, or lavender. The receptacle is flat, with several rows of phyllaries. The anthers are cream-coloured. The style is about 5 mm (0.20 in) long, and the stigma is capitate. The fruits are achenes with pappi. The species are found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and waste places. Cineraria is related to the genus Senecio. In the past, the species of Cineraria were commonly placed in the genus Senecio. The relationship between Cineraria and Senecio was reviewed by B. Nordenstam in 2002, who found that Cineraria was paraphyletic with respect to Senecio, and that the species of Cineraria were distributed in three separate sections of Senecio. One of these, Senecio sect. Cineraria, consisted of the species previously known as Cineraria. The other two were new sections, sect. Senecio variegata and sect. Oligoneuron. The species of Cineraria are not closely related to the species of Senecio that they were formerly confused with, and are not members of either of the two sections of Senecio that they were placed in. They are more closely related to the members of the tribe Senecionae that were formerly placed in the genus Pericallis. Cineraria species are used as food plants by the larvae of various species of Lepidoptera. Cineraria is a traditional remedy used in the Mediterranean region. It has been used in the past as a purgative, and as a treatment for liver and spleen disorders. It is also used as a substitute for coffee.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1891943}

John Bannerman always treasured his Highland heritage and was a native Gaelic speaker.  Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy and Glasgow High School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to Balliol College, Oxford and later to Cornell University in the United States.\n\nIn 1931 he married Ray Mundell and they had two sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was the Liberal Democrat MP, Ray Michie (later Baroness Michie of Gallanach). The historian John Bannerman was his son, and Donald Shade Munro, the rugby player and coach was his grandson.\n\nRugby union\n\nSchool and College Rugby\n\nBannerman started playing rugby union while at school, and between 1919\u201320, he was captain of Glasgow High School's 1st XV.\n\nBannerman was an accomplished sportsman winning a \"rugby blue\" at Oxford\n\nProvincial career\n\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1922 inter-city match.\n\nInternational career\n\nHe won 37 caps for Scotland, playing in all that country's internationals between 1921 and 1929 and was Scotland's most capped player until 1962 when Hugh McLeod surpassed his total. He played in Scotland's first \u201cgrand slam\u201d winning team in 1925, securing this achievement by beating England in the opening match of the new Murrayfield Stadium. In 1926 he played in the Scotland team that beat England at Twickenham and France in Paris, a feat that no Scottish team would repeat until 2021, 95 years later.\n\nHe went on to become Glasgow HSFP's most capped player.\n\nAdministrative career\n\nIn 1954\u201355, Bannerman served as President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\n\nCareer\nIn 1930, Bannerman was appointed as a farm manager on land owned by the Duke of Montrose. In 1952 Bannerman left the Montrose estate to become a farmer in his own interests and also that year became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Festival of Britain.\n\nPolitics\nBannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. From 1942 to 1957 he was a Forestry Commissioner. In 1938 he was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Argyll. When the seat fell vacant in 1940 it was mooted that Bannerman might run as a Liberal National but the negotiations with the Conservatives broke down robbing him of his best chance of entering the House of Commons. He contested Argyll unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election and Inverness in 1950. But in 1954 he was the candidate in an extraordinary by-election at Inverness which some historians have seen as a true turning point in Liberal fortunes in Scotland and perhaps the United Kingdom. From a position where there had been no Liberal candidate in the 1951 election, Bannerman jumped into second place over Labour, coming just 1331 votes behind the Tory winner. This was the best Liberal by-election performance since the war. At the general election of 1955, Bannerman came even closer, losing by just 966 votes. Although his vote share declined in the 1959 general election, the ground had been laid for a successful attack on the seat in the 1964 general election by Russell Johnston, who held the seat until he retired from the Commons in 1997.\n\nBannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1954 to 1964 and Rector of Aberdeen University in 1957. He made other attempts to enter the Commons, including giving Labour a close run at the Paisley by-election of 1961, registering 41.3% of the vote in a seat where there had been no Liberal candidate at the 1959 general election. He tried again without success at Paisley at the 1964 general election but in December 1967 he was made Baron Bannerman of Kildonan, of Kildonan in the County of Sutherland, and so finally entered Parliament.\n\nLife peerage\nBannerman was one of three Liberals to be made life peers in 1967; the others were Tim Beaumont and John Foot. Their appointments were attacked by the Young Liberals as undemocratic. One particular critic was Tony Greaves, then editor of the Young Liberal publication Gunfire, who argued that as the Liberal Party was in favour of a new social and political order, it was quite wrong to participate in the most pathetic feature of the existing order, the House of Lords. (Greaves would become Baron Greaves of Pendle in 2000).\n\nIn his maiden speech in the Lords, Bannerman took up the Scottish cause, referring to the anger of Hamilton where the Scottish National Party had just won a parliamentary by-election; and warning it was the anger of two centuries in which the Scots had been a \"sleeping partner\" in the United Kingdom political scene.\n\nGaelic culture\nIn 1922 he won the prestigious gold medal for solo singing at the Royal National M\u00f2d in Fort William. He was President of An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach, the national Gaelic Society, a position previously held by his father,  from 1949 to 1954.\n\nDeath \nHe died in Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969 aged 67.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Bath, Richard (ed.)

He and his brother, the paramount chief Great Sun, allied his people with the French colonists. He was a friend of the colonist and chronicler Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz. Du Pratz described their friendship and Tattooed Serpent's death and funeral in detail in his chronicle.\n\nSource of the name\nThe name Obalalkabiche (Tattooed Serpent) was traditionally adopted by the War Chief of the Natchez, who was always the younger brother of the Paramount Chief, whose official name was Yak-stalchil (Great Sun).\nThus, the Tattooed Serpent who died in 1725 and was a friend of Du Pratz was preceded by his own maternal uncle (died 1700), who was also called Tattooed Serpent while in office. On his death in 1725, Tattooed Serpent was succeeded by his sister's second eldest son, who took the same name. As an emblem of the office, he was decorated with the elaborate tattoo of a serpent circling his body from his foot to his mouth.\n\nLife\nIn 1723, Tattooed Serpent helped the French negotiate a peace treaty after the Second Natchez War 1723, which ended the attacks on the French by the Natchez of the White Apple Village. He was such a friend of the French that, according to the chronicle of Dumont de Montigny, his sister, called La Glorieuse by the French, said that \"he was like a Frenchman\".\n\nAt his death, he and his older brother were both succeeded by much younger men. The alliance between the French and the Natchez became unstable, as the leaders of the pro-British White Apple village gained influence. This eventually led to the Natchez Massacre of 1729, and the end of amiable relations between the French and the Natchez.\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nLe Page du Pratz describes in great detail the events surrounding the death of Tattooed Serpent, including his funeral. When he died, his brother, the Paramount Chief Great Sun, was so grief-stricken that he wanted to follow his brother in death by suicide. Le Page du Pratz managed to prevent the Great Sun from doing so.\n\nAt the funeral of Tattooed Serpent, a number of commoner class servants of the War Chief were sacrificed by garrotting, following the Natchez custom. According to du Pratz, two of his wives, one of his sisters (La Glorieuse), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant's wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women. An infant was sacrificed, strangled by his parents. These retainers had their faces painted red and were drugged with large doses of nicotine or Jimson weed before their deaths.\n\nDuring the funeral procession, the chief's body was carried to the temple on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles. The temple was located on top of a low platform mound. The retainers were ritually strangled at the temple.\n\nTattooed Serpent was buried in a trench inside the temple floor, while his retainers were buried in other locations atop the mound surrounding the temple. After a few months time, the bodies were disinterred and their defleshed bones were stored as bundle burials in the temple.\n\nSee also\nTattooed Arm\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNatchez people\n18th-century Native Americans", "machine_text": " Tattooed Serpent The Tattooed Serpent is a figure that appears in the legends of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

The serpent is said to live in a lake, and to have a habit of sneaking up on unwary travelers and consuming them. In some versions of the story, the serpent is said to have a detachable head, which it uses to lure its victims. In some versions of the story, the Tattooed Serpent is said to be the father of the first humans. In these versions, the serpent is said to have mated with a human woman, and to have produced a race of half-serpent, half-human hybrids. The hybrids were said to have been fertile, and to have produced the modern human race. The Tattooed Serpent is often depicted in the arts of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

He completed a PhD supervised by Hedley Bull, on the global nuclear strategies of the United States and the Soviet Union. He was based for several months in the USA at the Institute of War and Peace.  He joined ANU as a lecturer in 1974, later becoming Special Professor in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific in 1987.\n\nBall was an opponent of the draft for the Vietnam War in Australia (although not the war itself, at the time), and was arrested for protesting against it. He won an appeal in the Supreme Court against his conviction. From 1966 he was a \"person of interest\" for ASIO, particularly following his inquiries into the Pine Gap secret tracking facility and Nurrungar in Australia from 1969, and was taken to court after the publication of A Suitable Piece of Real Estate in 1980. He held ASIO in disdain, for its inability to recognise aspects of defence co-operation with the US infringed Australian national interests by remaining entirely secret.\n\nBall was diagnosed with incurable cancer and died on 12 October 2016 at the age of 69. Despite his illness, he continued writing and working until his death.\n\nContributions\n\nBall was a political realist, and a believer in liberal institutions and solid defence strategies. He used an inductive, investigative approach to security studies.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Ball was invited to critique US nuclear defence plans\u2014his analysis persuading the US that its plan to destroy selected Soviet targets in a limited strike would not work in practice and would lead to all-out nuclear escalation. His analysis has been acknowledged by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nBall worked on Australia's signal intelligence and exposed Australia's secret history of cracking diplomatic cables. In 1998 with David Horner he confirmed wartime Soviet spying in Australia revealed by the Petrov Affair, carried out by staff in Evatt's Foreign Affairs Department.  \n\nHe studied, and was active in, some of Southeast Asia's \"shadow wars\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A screw and a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below) are similar types of fastener typically made of metal and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in a matching part. \n\nScrews are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and  prevents pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; materials commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\nExplanation\nA screw is a combination of simple machines: it is, in essence, an inclined plane wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge at the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, called a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut object with an internal thread.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\nA screw will usually have a head on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include a screwdrivers and a wrench. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions. A carriage bolt has a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  A set screw may have a head the same size or smaller than the outer diameter of the screws thread; a set screw without a head is sometimes called a grub screw. A J-bolt has a J-shaped head that is sunk into concrete to serve as an anchor bolt. \n\nThe cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the pitch.\n\nMost screws and bolts are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.\n\nDifferentiation between bolt and screw\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows:\n\nThis distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt.\n\nThe issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with Machinery's Handbook distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:\n\nWood screws \nEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws. Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England. During the 1850s, swaging tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads. Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).\n\nOnce screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\nMachine screws \nASME standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\" in diameters ranging up to .  These fasteners are often used as bolts with nuts, but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\nHex cap screws \nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is  in diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  Machinery's Handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\". Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the \"Finished Hex Bolts\" and renamed them the \"Hex Cap Screw\"\u2014a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.\n\nLug bolts and head bolts \nThese terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with Machinery's Handbook distinction.\n\nLag screw \n\nLag screws (US) or coach screws (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the Handbook. However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\nUnited States government standards \nThe federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).\n\nHistorical issue \nOld USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\nControlled vocabulary versus natural language \nThe distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word bolt is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.\n\nOther distinctions\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.  On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\nTypes of screws and bolts\n\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are generally designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\nFasteners with a tapered shank\n\nFasteners with a non-tapered shank\n\nFasteners with built in washers\nA fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\nOther threaded fasteners\n\nSuperbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner \nA superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\nBone screws\n\nThe field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\nList of abbreviations for types of screws\n\nThese abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, knowing that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", it may be possible to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.\n\nThe extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.\n\nMaterials\n\nScrews and bolts are usually made of steel. \nWhere great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.\n\nGalvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. \nSome types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.\n\nOften a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.\n\nSelection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.\n\nMechanical classifications\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.\n\nMetric \n\nThe international standards for metric externally threaded fasteners are ISO 898-1 for property classes produced from carbon steels and ISO 3506-1 for property classes produced from corrosion resistant steels.\n\nInch \nThere are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 & ASTM A193.\n\nScrew head shapes\n\n  A low disc with a rounded, high outer edge with large surface area.\n Button or  Cylindrical with a rounded top.\n  A dome-shaped head used for decoration.\n Mushroom or  Lower-profile dome designed to prevent tampering.\n Countersunk or  Conical, with flat outer face and tapering inner face allowing it to sink into the material. The angle of the screw is measured as the aperture of the cone.\n Oval or  A decorative screw head with a countersunk bottom and rounded top. Also known as \"raised countersunk\" in the UK.\n  Similar to countersunk, but there is a smooth progression from the shank to the angle of the head, similar to the bell of a bugle.\n  Disc with cylindrical outer edge, height approximately half the head diameter.\n  Cylindrical, but with a slightly convex top surface. Height to diameter ratio is larger than cheese head.\n  A flanged head can be any of the above head styles (except the countersunk styles) with the addition of an integrated flange at the base of the head. This eliminates the need for a flat washer.\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.\n\ns \n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\nTools\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.\n\nThread standards\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.\n\nISO metric screw thread\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25\u00a0mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. \"M8\u00d71\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8\u00a0mm and advances by 1\u00a0mm per 360\u00b0 rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1\u00a0mm, is made by threading a 6\u00a0mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5\u00a0mm diameter (6\u00a0mm - 1\u00a0mm).\n\nMetric hexagon bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in International Standards ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\nWhitworth\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55\u00b0, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" UNC bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 respectively.\n\nBritish Association screw thread\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order\u2014it may be suspected\u2014to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6\u00a0mm diameter and 1\u00a0mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch \u00a0mm (0.65\u00a0mm) and diameter \u00a0mm (3.62\u00a0mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.\n\nUnified Thread Standard\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes  inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 \u00d7 number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 \u00d7 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112\u00a0inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought \u2013 seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 \u2013 (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.\n\nManufacture\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n\nThe blanks are then polished again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via thread rolling; however, some are cut. The workpiece is then tumble finished with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing. For most screws, a coating, such as electroplating with zinc (galvanizing) or applying black oxide, is applied to prevent corrosion.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile a recent hypothesis attributes the Archimedes' screw to Sennacherib, King of Assyria, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the Hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a Greek invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath Archimedes.  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.\n\nEarlier, the screw had been described by the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum (428\u2013350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.\n\nRybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, tournevis) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and \"clinch bolts\" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees\u2014the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735\u20131800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771\u20131831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760\u20131800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. Standardization of threadforms began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near Philipsburg for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by \u201crolling and wire drawing apparatus\u201d from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. \n\nThe American development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was popularized by American Henry F. Phillips.\n\nThreadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.\n\nPrecision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution. They are key components of micrometers and lathes.\n\nOther fastening methods\nAlternative fastening methods are:\n\n nails\n rivets\n pins (dowel pins, taper pins, roll pins, spring pins, cotter pins)\n pinned shafts (keyed shafts, woodruff keys, gibb-headed key)\n screw bolt, pin bolt or cotter bolt, and clench bolt- as used in clinker boat building\n welding\n soldering\n brazing\n joinery (mortise & tenon, dovetailing, box joints, lap joints)\n gluing\n taping\n clinch fastening\n\nSee also\n\n Bolted joint\n Dowel\n Fastener\n Gender of connectors and fasteners\n Syndesmotic screw\n Tap and die\n Die head\n Thread angle\n Threaded fastener\n Threaded insert\n Threaded rod (e.g. studs, allthread)\n Threading\n Thread-locking compound\n Thread pitch gauge\n Wall plug\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n How the World Got Screwed\n NASA-RP-1228 Fastener Design Manual\n Imperial/Metric fastening sizes comparison\n \"Hold Everything\", February 1946, ''Popular Science\" article section on screws and screw fastener  technology developed during World War Two\n How to feed screws and dowels\n\nMetalworking\n \nWoodworking\nArticles containing video clips", "machine_text": " Screw (orman-dane) A screw is a type of fastener, in some ways similar to a bolt, typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread. Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. Screws are used in many applications, such as to fasten metal parts together and to fasten metal to wood. In these applications, screws have largely replaced nails, where nails are still used. The largest user of screws is the residential housing industry, where screws are used both to fasten wood to wood and to fasten metal to wood. The basic design of a screw can be divided into four parts: the head, the neck, the body, and the tip. The head is the part of the screw that is used to turn it. The head can be a variety of shapes, such as a button or a cross. In some applications, such as with a screw driver, the head can be a standard shape so that a variety of different screws can be turned with the same tool. The neck is the unthreaded part of the screw that is directly below the head. It is typically used to attach the head to the body. The body is the part of the screw that is threaded for most of its length. The body typically has a constant diameter, although some screws, such as lag screws, have a tapered body. The tip is the end of the screw that is opposite the head. The tip is typically pointed to allow the screw to be started in a surface. There are many different types of screws, all designed for different applications. Common types of screws include: Wood screws: used to fasten wood to wood and wood to metal Metal screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood Self-tapping screws: used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole, sometimes called sheet metal screws Thread-forming screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood, also called thread-rolling screws Lag screws: used to fasten wood to wood Security screws: used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened In addition, there are many variants of the basic screw design, including: Screws with a variety of head designs Screws with a variety of body designs Screws with a variety of tip designs Screws used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood are sometimes called metal screws. Metal screws are similar to wood screws, except that the shaft is threaded for most of its length. Metal screws can be used with nuts or screwed directly into a threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Machine screws are similar to metal screws, except that they are designed to be used with a nut or threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Self-tapping screws are used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole. They are sometimes called sheet metal screws. Thread-forming screws are used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood. They are also called thread-rolling screws. Screws used to fasten wood to wood are sometimes called wood screws. Wood screws are similar to metal screws, except that the shaft is not threaded for most of its length. Wood screws are designed to be used with a pilot hole. Lag screws are similar to wood screws, except that they have a much thicker shaft and a blunt tip. They are used to fasten wood to wood. Security screws are designed to be used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened. Security screws are typically used to fasten a license plate to a car or to fasten the cover of a computer port. A screw is used to fasten things together by turning it in the direction that causes the screw to dig in and wedge into a material. The screw is typically inserted into a pre-drilled hole, and as the screw is turned, the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. The first use of screws to fasten metal is believed to have been in the 15th century, in the Visby ship. Screws were used to hold pieces of wood together in the 17th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to wood in the 18th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to metal in the 19th century. The largest user of screws is the residential housing industry.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20691673}

In the southern kingdom of Khandia, the priestess Zohren is accused of sacrilege and treason. The King's diviners have predicted the downfall of the kingdom, and Zohren's name has come up in the prophecy. She is to be executed, but manages to escape. She goes to the temple of God Who Dies, where she is given a vision of a man with a broken sword, who will bring the death of Khandia. She is told to go to the land of Drenan, to find the man with the broken sword. In Drenan, Druss is a legendary warrior who has lived for centuries, fighting in the name of good. But Druss has become bored with endless battle and bloodshed, and has retired to his farm to live in peace. Zohren finds Druss, and tells him of the prophecy. Druss asks her if she is certain that it is his broken blade that is spoken of, and she tells him that she is. Druss then reveals to her that his blade was broken in a battle with the demon folk, and that he has hidden the pieces. He asks her to show him where the pieces are, but she says she does not know. Druss then asks her to name the place where the battle took place, and she says it was in the demon city of Mashrapur. Druss tells her that he will go to Mashrapur and recover the pieces of his sword. Druss goes to Mashrapur, and finds the pieces of his sword. He also finds the grave of a man who died in the battle, and takes the man's amulet. The amulet is the symbol of the 17th Squad of the Immortals, and Druss wears it to remind him of his own mortality. In Khandia, the King's diviners are troubled by the prophecy. They discuss the possibility that the man with the broken sword might be Druss, and they decide to send an assassin to kill him. The assassin finds Druss and attacks him, but Druss kills the assassin and returns to Khandia to face the King's diviners. The diviners tell Druss that they have changed the prophecy, and that he is no longer the man with the broken sword. They say that the man with the broken sword has already been born, and that he is a servant of the demon folk. Druss does not believe them, and he threatens to kill them. The diviners then admit that they were wrong, and that Druss is indeed the man with the broken sword. Druss goes to the temple of God Who Dies, where he prays for guidance. He is given a vision of a man with a broken sword, who will bring the death of Khandia. Druss realizes that the man in the vision is himself, and that the prophecy is true. Druss leaves the temple, and goes to the King's palace. He tells the King that he is the man with the broken sword, and that he will bring the death of Khandia. The King does not believe him, and sends his guards to arrest Druss. Druss fights the guards and kills them, and then he faces the King in a one-on-one combat. Druss wins the fight, and the King is killed. In the end, Druss becomes the King of Khandia. He unites the people of the land, and he builds a new capital city. He also reforms the army, and he creates a new unit of warriors called the 17th Squad of the Immortals. The 17th Squad is made up of the finest warriors in the land, and they are led by Druss's son, Orrin.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 52705911}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Zurich Airport\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Zurich Airport (, ) is the largest international airport of Switzerland and the principal hub of Swiss International Air Lines. It serves Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland's largest city, and, with its surface transport links, much of the rest of the country. The airport is located  north of central Z\u00fcrich, in the municipalities of Kloten, R\u00fcmlang, Oberglatt, Winkel, and Opfikon, all of which are within the canton of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\nIn the Zurich area, mixed civil and military air traffic developed from 1909 onwards at D\u00fcbendorf airfield, northeast of the city. From 1919, the airport was home to Swissair's predecessor Ad Astra Aero, and from 1932 also to Swissair. The first international flight from Switzerland landed on July 21, 1921.  In the early years of aviation, the D\u00fcbendorf Air Base, located some  to the Zurich Airport, also served as the city's commercial airfield. The need for a dedicated commercial facility led to the search for a location at which to build a replacement airport.\n\nIn 1939, civil air traffic had to be suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War for military strategic reasons. Although Swissair was allowed to resume scheduled air traffic in September 1940, this remained on a modest scale during the war.\n\nIn March 1943, the government of the canton of Zurich commissioned a study to identify possible locations for the construction of a major airport. In its report, a consortium of engineers and architects led by Locher & Cie company advised against the previously discussed expansion options at D\u00fcbendorf airport and instead recommended a separate civil airport in the partially forested moorland area of the armory situated between Kloten and Oberglatt. In August 1943, the Federal Military Department declared its agreement to abandon the armory as a matter of principal \"in the higher national interest\".\n\nLocher & Cie submitted \"Project I\" to the Government on 31 December 1943. Four runways were planned and together with the buildings the required area was 472 hectares. Without the purchase of land, the project would have cost 87 million CHF. The government found the costs too high and ordered a revision. The \"Project II\" of 29 April 1944 still provided for an area of 290 hectares and costs of 65 million CHF, but the government council demanded a further reduction. For \"Project III\" of 31 July 1944, 54.4 million and 215 hectares were required. The project nevertheless met the requirements of an intercontinental airport. The Government formally approved it and submitted it to the Federal Government, strongly emphasizing that the Zurich project was \"far superior\" to the also planned (and ultimately abandoned) Swiss Central Airport Utzenstorf near Bern.\n\nIn December 1944, the responsible Federal Councillor, Enrico Celio, explicitly spoke out in favour of Zurich-Kloten, in a letter to his counterparts, as did the governments of the cantons of Eastern and Central Switzerland and Ticino a month later. The National Council and Council of States followed this view and on 22 June 1945 approved the \"Federal Decree on the Expansion of Civil Airports\". Basel, Bern and Geneva were to receive smaller continental airports and be supported with a 30 percent share of the costs. The Zurich project was granted the status of an intercontinental airport and the highest possible subsidy rate of 35 percent.\n\nSwitzerland's federal parliament decided in 1945 that Z\u00fcrich was to be the site of a major airport, and sold  of the Kloten-B\u00fclach Artillery Garrison () to the canton of Z\u00fcrich, giving the canton control of the new airfield. Construction of the airport began the following year.\n\nInitial plans for the airport, as laid out in the Federal government's scheme of 1945, were centered on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. Aircraft of up to 80 tons were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weathers and at night, with a -wide hard surface running to  in length. Additional  areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of runway excursions. Additional domestic runways, between  in length, were also to be built.\n\nFirst stage of construction: civil engineering \nOn 25 February 1946, the Zurich Cantonal Council approved a building loan of 36.8 million. The cantonal referendum of 5 May 1946 resulted in a clear approval with 105,705 votes in favour, 29,372 against.\n\"Project IV\" never came to fruition, as it was further developed by adapting it to the ICAO standards which were changing rapidly at the time. Instead of four runways, the new \"Project V\" of 20 May 1946 provided only three. Project VI\" of 9 October 1946 increased the dimensions of all three runways. Finally, the slightly modified \"Project VII\" of 20 December 1947 was realised.\nWithin three years, the design on the drawing board had completely changed from a purely grass airfield with a four-runway system without taxiways to a three-runway system with paved taxiways. The staggered design meant that it was possible to react to changes without having to impose a complete halt to construction.\n\nConstruction works finally began on 5 May 1946 with the diversion of the Altbach stream. The 1900 m long West Runway 10/28 was the first runway which was opened on 14 June 1948, and on which the first Swissair Douglas DC-4 took off for London. On behalf of the canton as airport owner, Cantonal Councillor Jakob K\u00e4gi gave a speech to mark the inauguration of the new runway and the start of provisional flight operations. Shortly after, on 17 November 1948, the 2600 m long blind runway 16/34 (runway with instrument landing system) was opened for operation, which was attended by the seven members of the cantonal government. In the presence of invited guests from politics and the media as well as representatives of the construction companies and airlines, the new airport was inaugurated, which meant that the relocation of the entire civil flight operations from D\u00fcbendorf to Kloten had already been completed and full operation could begin at the new Zurich airport.\n\nThe 1535 m long Bisen runway 02/20, which belonged to the three-runway system of 1948, was of little importance. Due to the applicable crosswind regulations at that time, the runway was designed to face the Bise in order to guarantee the airport's all-weather capability. However, the ICAO increased the crosswind tolerances for aircraft in subsequent revisions to such an extent that the runway was decommissioned after just over ten years.\n\nFirst stage of construction: structural engineering \nThe character of a provisional solution was supported - despite full operation - by the lack of buildings, especially the \"Flughof\", which had been planned since 1946. Instead, a growing shanty town stood to the east of the reserved building site. On 27 October 1948, the canton outsourced the development, construction and operation of the buildings to the newly founded \"Flughafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft\" (FIG), a mixed-economy public limited company in which the public sector held half of the shares (canton of Zurich 22.5%, city of Zurich 18%, \"Z\u00fcrcher Kantonalbank\" 5%, city of Winterthur 3.6% and municipality of Kloten 0.9%).\nThe FIG took over projects that had been started and was thus able to hand over the completed \"shipyard I\" to Swissair for use as early as late autumn 1948, followed by offices for Swissair's technical departments, which were finally able to leave D\u00fcbendorf by the end of April 1949. Further workshops, the striking arched hangar and the \"Heating Centre I\" for the heat supply were completed by the end of 1949.\n\nBased on \"Project V\", the terminal building had already been designed as a convex building at the airport head in mid-1946. In the following four years, a total of 24 feasible airport project designs were submitted, before the FIG commissioned the construction of the airport according to plans by Alfred and Heinrich Oeschger in November 1950. At the beginning of 1951, the piling work for the terminal building began, the construction work took about two years. With the opening on 9 April 1953, the shanty town could be abandoned. The new building consisted of a central passenger wing, flanked by a restaurant and an office wing. In addition there was a spectator terrace of 200m length.\n\nThe first years of operation\nAs had been expected the construction costs had been significantly exceeded. Several metres of raised bog were removed and backfilled with material from the Holberg; the concrete area had also increased from the originally planned 420,000 m2 to a good 611,000 m2. In addition, the former weapons range area had to be searched for unexploded bombs, of which a total of 157 were found. The costs for \"Project IV\", estimated at CHF 59.5 million in 1946, had risen to CHF 106 million by the time the civil engineering works under \"Project VII\" were completed in July 1949. Both chambers of the Federal Assembly concluded the political review with the \"Federal Decree on the Payment of Additional Federal Contributions to the Construction of Zurich-Kloten Airport\" of 29 September 1949. The Federation contributed CHF 27.1 million and doubled its contribution to the air traffic control facilities. For its part, the Zurich Cantonal Council granted a supplementary credit on 13 February 1950. This was accepted by the voters on 7 May 1950 with 73,551 votes to 59,088 (yes share of 55.45%).\n\nThe new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran three days. In 1947, the airport handled 133,638 passengers on 12,766 airline flights; in 1952, 372,832 passengers on 24,728 airline flights.\n\nSecond stage of construction\nLocher & Cie was commissioned in 1954 to design various project options for the second construction phase. In March 1956, the canton submitted an extended project to the Federal Council. In addition to mandatory runway extensions for the incipient \"jet age\", the project also provided for the extension of the public facilities, which were already overused and dominated by various provisional arrangements; two finger docks were to defuse the situation. On 12 October 1956, the Federal Council recommended that parliament approve the bill. On 19 December 1956, the Council of States approved the federal contribution of CHF 54.8 million (at a total cost of 181.8 million), the National Council followed suit on 7 March 1957. The contribution of the Canton of Zurich of CHF 74.3 million was still outstanding, the rest was to be raised by FIG and Swissair. The concrete expansion project included the extension of the blind runway to 4000 m and the western runway to 3150 m, as well as the extension of the buildings. Opponents described the \"super airport Kloten\" as a \"luxury\" and criticised that the canton had \"lost every measure\". Another issue that planners had completely neglected until then was the aircraft noise. With a high turnout of 72.3%, the expansion project failed in the cantonal referendum of 23 June 1957 with 97,603 votes to 83,196 (no vote of 54.0%).\n\nJust four days later, the Zurich government council commissioned a redimensioned expansion project. The blind runway was to be only 3700 m long, the western runway 2500 m; the construction of the finger docks was abandoned. Thus the canton's share of the project to be approved was only CHF 49.1 million. The government gave far more attention to the aircraft noise. On 6 July 1958, voters approved the project by 107,050 votes to 56,872 (yes share 65.3%), with a 65.6% share. Due to time pressure - the landing of the first jet aircraft was planned for the following year - construction work began without waiting for approval of the federal funding. In December 1958 and March 1959 respectively, the National Council and the Council of States granted subsidies of 55.6 million. In 1959, BOAC started regular flight connections to Zurich with the revised \"Comet IV\", while the airport was still a construction site.\n\nThe first buildings were completed in 1960, and the terminal building, which had been considered an attractive design, lost its symmetrical appearance. To the east, towards the former shanty town, office wing A1, office wing B and the air traffic control building were added with a connecting structure. The \"Fracht West\" building, which had been extended at short notice during construction to provide additional office space, was located somewhat off the main building. In the hangar area in the southwest, Heating Station II was put into operation and the Hangar II, which was designed for jet aircraft, was handed over to Swissair, shortly after the arrival of the Sud Aviation \"Caravelle III\" and the Douglas DC-8-32 in May 1960. Finally, in the summer of 1961, Swissair's in-flight catering service was given a new building between the head of the airport and the hangar area.\n\nThe Canton of Zurich acquired a further 135 hectares of land for the expansion of the civil engineering works, which lasted until the beginning of 1961 in parallel with the construction of the buildings. The apron areas were enlarged, particularly at the airport head and in the hangar area; the pier was also extended from 16 to 28 aircraft parking spaces, and buses were purchased to provide access to them. The west runway 10/28 was extended by 600 metres to the west, towards R\u00fcmlang, and opened on 1 January 1961 with its new operating length of 2500 metres. Blind runway 16/34 was extended 400 metres to the south in the direction of Opfikon and 700 metres to the north in the direction of Oberglatt. At its new operating length of 3700 m, it was released on 15 March 1961. By the time work was completed, the paved area at the airport covered 1,013,000 m2.\n\nExtension of the Terminal Building\nAlthough virtually all the buildings of the second phase had been completed by the end of 1961, the extension of the terminal building was still at the design stage. After the passenger terminal with two finger docks had failed in the cantonal referendum, the FIG had worked out a new project until 1958. This envisaged a two-storey transverse hall on the landside of the airport, on the two main floors of which arriving and departing passengers were functionally separated. For cost reasons, the federal government demanded a considerable redimensioning, which led to an open dispute about the preferred design. When the conflict, described by the media as a \"war of experts\", threatened to escalate, President Willy Sp\u00fchler invited representatives of the Federation and the cantons to a conference on 9 December 1963.\n\nDuring the conference, FIG's airport planners and the Canton of Zurich prevailed against the federal government. The canton only had to make concessions for the commercial parts of the project, such as the restaurant wing. The dispatch of the Federal Council, submitted on 1 March 1965, requested a federal contribution of 23.1 million to the total costs of 129.4 million. Of this, 2.1 million was earmarked for the connection of the airport to the national road network and for the preparation of a connection to the planned (but never built) Zurich underground railway. The National Council and Council of States adopted the bill in October 1965, allowing construction work to begin the following year. The motorway loop was in operation from 1968. Finally, with the opening of the last new hall wing on 1 April 1971, the extension of the terminal building was completed.\n\nThe first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced. Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.\n\nAttacks on El Al aircraft\n\nOn 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attacked El Al flight 432, firing Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Boeing 720B whilst it prepared for takeoff. The Shin Bet employee Mordechai Rachamim fired back with his pistol and killed the terrorist Abdel Mohsen Hassan. The three remaining assassins were each sentenced to twelve years in prison. The aircraft's co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.\n\nThe attack marked the beginning of a discussion about airport security that had never been raised until then in Switzerland. On 21 February 1970 a parcel bomb exploded in Swissair's Convair CV-990 on flight SR330 (Zurich-Tel Aviv). In the crash near W\u00fcrenlingen all 47 people on board were killed. Investigations revealed that a PFLP terrorist group had carried out the bomb attack. The actual target, however, had been an El Al flight from Munich to Tel Aviv, whose mail had been sent with Swissair to Zurich due to long delays. In 1970 the PFLP obtained the release of the three terrorists convicted in Switzerland and other comrades-in-arms imprisoned abroad through coordinated hijackings. Flights affected were SR 100 (Zurich-New York), TWA flight TW741, Pan Am flight PA93 and BOAC flight BA775.\n\nThird stage of construction\nIn January 1969, the Zurich Cantonal Council approved a loan for preparatory work for the third stage of expansion. The project that was subsequently drawn up clearly exceeded the previous dimensions. The plans included the extension of the existing runways, a 3300 m long runway, additional taxiways, the enlargement of the pier to 47 stands, a new terminal with finger dock, two multi-storey car parks, additional technical buildings, an airport railway station and a new hangar. In addition, there were various extensions and conversions of existing buildings. The costs were estimated at CHF 777.6 million (not including the air traffic control building and railway station). Since this project was hardly different from the \"super airport\" rejected in 1957, criticism was immediately voiced again by the \"Protection Association of the Population around Zurich Airport\" (SBFZ) and the community of H\u00f6ri, which was located directly in the approach corridor. The SBFZ even demanded the resumption of the central airport concept that was dropped in 1945 - instead of Utzenstorf this time in the \"Grosse Moos\", with two runways jutting into Lake Neuch\u00e2tel.\n\nThe supporters of the Zurich airport expansion argued primarily with the economic benefit. In order to take the wind out of the sails of aircraft noise criticism, the government and cantonal council are drafting an aircraft noise law (including a ban on night flights), which should be submitted to a referendum at the same time as the expansion bill. After the Cantonal Council had approved both bills in July 1970, the referendum was held on 27 September 1970. The proposal for expansion was approved by 103,867 votes to 64,192 (61.8% yes), the Aircraft Noise Act by 134,501 votes to 32,590 (80.5% yes). The following year, the Federal Assembly approved a federal contribution of 240.3 million. Construction work on the third stage also began in 1971. In 1973, Hangar III, Cargo Hall East, Car Park F and the General Aviation Centre were completed. In 1974 the \"Werkhof\" (work yard), an office building and multistorey car park E were added, in 1975 the apron, multi-storey car park B and Terminal B with finger dock, and in 1976 the Airport Plaza shopping and service centre located in multi-storey car park B.\n\nAdditional costs were incurred due to numerous adjustments to the construction project. The additional credit of 25.8 million was accepted by Zurich voters on 7 December 1975 with 178,723 to 87,303 votes (67.2% yes). The canton supplemented this credit with ordinary and extraordinary budget credits from the building department. In March 1976 the Federal Assembly approved an additional federal contribution of 39.7 million.\nAs the centrepiece of the third stage, runway 14/32 was opened on 1 April 1976, increasing capacity by a third. In the early days, the new runway served exclusively for landing traffic. The rail link, which had been approved by parliament in 1975 in a separate federal decree, was still outstanding. As this was a project of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the cost allocation differed greatly. Of the total costs of 285 million, the SBB contributed 60%, the Federation 33% and the Canton of Zurich 7%. The project comprised the Zurich Airport railway station under Terminal B (on which construction had been underway since 1971) and a new line between Bassersdorf and Glattbrugg. After nine years of construction, the ceremonial opening of the airport line took place on 29 May 1980.\n\nFourth stage of construction\nIn the second half of the 1970s, the volume of traffic continued to rise sharply, so the Canton of Zurich, the FIG and Swissair worked out a project for the fourth construction phase. On 28 September 1980, with 142,240 to 104,775 votes (57.6%), Zurich voters accepted a loan of CHF 48 million for civil engineering works, which were part of the forthcoming construction work.\n\nAlso in 1980, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation published a new airport concept, which replaced that of 1945. The focus was now on qualitative expansion, taking into account spatial planning and environmental protection considerations.\n\nBased on this concept, the Federal Assembly approved the \"Building Programme 1981-1985\". This programme provided for investments of CHF 393.3 million in Zurich-Kloten, but the subsidy contribution of 10.3% was significantly lower than for the Geneva and Basel-Mulhouse airports. This was justified by the catch-up demand of the two other major Swiss airports.\nThe central element of the fourth stage was the finger dock in Terminal A with 13 docking positions. Also planned were a new control tower, a baggage sorting system, an additional multi-storey car park, waiting rooms and an operations centre for aircraft crews. Later, the Zurich government council also decided to renew the damaged western runway, which had to be closed for two and a half months in the summer of 1985 for this purpose. Fingerdock A was put into operation on 1 November 1985, the new 41 m high control tower on 29 April 1986.\nThere were also plans to expand the airport's cargo facilities. However, a corresponding loan of CHF 57 million was narrowly rejected in the referendum of 6 September 1987 by 106,722 to 98,663 votes (52.0% against).\nThe project, which was subsequently revised and approved by the Zurich Cantonal Council in 1989, focused on more efficient use of the existing facilities, thereby enabling the handling of an additional 100,000 tonnes of freight annually.\n\nFifth stage of construction (\"Airport 2000\")\nThe cantonal popular initiative \"for moderate air traffic\" submitted in January 1991 intended to limit the airport to its then status, i.e. neither to allow more aircraft movements nor to expand the infrastructure. In the vote of 26 September 1993, however, it did not stand a chance and was clearly rejected by 235,531 votes to 112,476 (67.6%).\nNine months later, the Zurich cantonal government submitted a proposal for a loan of CHF 873 million to the cantonal council. The fifth construction phase, known as \"Airport 2000\" and costing a total of CHF 2.4 billion, was intended to replace outdated systems and further expand existing facilities. At the heart of the project was the construction of a third terminal, Dock E \"Midfield\", located between the three runways. The Skymetro aerial tramway, a road tunnel and underground baggage conveyors were necessary for its development. Also part of the fifth stage was the construction of the new passenger hub \"Airside Center\". The Cantonal Council approved the project at the end of February 1995.\nIt cleared the last hurdle in the referendum of 25 June 1995, when it was approved by 224,668 votes to 105,859 (68.0% Yes).\nAfter almost nine years of construction, the project was completed in 2004.\n\n\"Zurich 2010\" project\nThe next major event for the airport was in 1999, when the Parliament of the canton of Z\u00fcrich approved privatization of Zurich Airport. The following year, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, trading under the brand Unique, became the new airport operator. The company dropped the brand Unique in favour of Zurich Airport and Flughafen Z\u00fcrich in 2010.\n\nOn 2 October 2001, a major cash-flow crisis at Swissair, exacerbated by the global downturn in air travel caused by the September 11 attacks, caused the airline to ground all its flights. Although a government rescue plan permitted some flights to restart a few days later, and the airline's assets were subsequently sold to become Swiss International Air Lines, the airport lost a large volume of traffic. After Lufthansa took control of Swiss International Air Lines in 2005, traffic began to grow again.\n\nOn 18 October 2001, Germany and Switzerland signed a treaty regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Under the terms of this treaty, any incoming aircraft after 22:00 had to approach Z\u00fcrich from the east to land on runway 28, which, unlike the airport's other runways, was not equipped with an instrument landing system. A month later, at 22:06 on 24 November, an inbound Crossair Avro RJ100 using this approach in conditions of poor visibility crashed into a range of hills near Bassersdorf and exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board. The flight had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14 before 22:00, but it was subject to delay and was therefore diverted to runway 28.\n\nZurich Airport completed a major expansion project in 2003, in which it built a new parking garage, a new midfield terminal, and an automated underground people mover to link the midfield terminal to the main terminal. In November 2008 a complete renovation and rebuild of the old terminal B structure was announced. The new terminal B opened in November 2011, and provides segregated access to and from aircraft for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers. Zurich Airport handled 25.5 million passengers in 2014, up 2.5 percent from 2013.\n\nEtihad Regional ceased on 18 February 2015 to fly two-thirds of its scheduled routes without further notice, amongst them all its services from Z\u00fcrich except the domestic service to Geneva. Etihad Regional blamed the failure of its expansion on the behavior of competitors, especially Swiss International Air Lines, as well as the Swiss aviation authorities.\n\nFollowing the demolition of some office buildings the construction of the new baggage sorting facilities between the Operations Center and Terminal 1 began in spring 2018 with a total investment of CHF 500 million.\n\nAs of 2020, the marketing of all advertising space at the airport was transferred from Clear Channel to APG.\n\nThe main Terminal 1 will be completely rebuilt - including the tower of the Skyguide Air Traffic Control. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2021, with completion expected in 2030. In addition to the old building fabric, the expected growth in passenger numbers is the main reason for the pending construction work. \"The forecasts suggest that the number of passengers arriving, departing or transferring at Zurich Airport each year today will grow from 29 million today to 50 million by 2030,\" says the airport operator's personnel booklet.\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe airport is owned by Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG, a company quoted on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Major shareholders include the canton of Z\u00fcrich, with 33.33% plus one of the shares, and the city of Z\u00fcrich, with 5% of the shares. No other shareholder has a holding exceeding 3%. Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG used the brand name Unique from 2000 until 2010.\n\nThe company has stakes in various other airports around the world.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTerminal complex\nThe airport has three airside piers, which are known as terminals A, B, and E (also signposted as Gates A, B/D, and E). These are linked to a central air-side building called Airside Center, built in 2003. Alongside the Airside Center, the ground-side terminal complex named Airport Center comprises several buildings, and includes airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. All departing passengers access the same departure level of the Airside Center, which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. They are then segregated between passengers for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations on the way to the gate lounges, with the latter first passing through emigration controls. Arriving Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are handled in separate areas of the Airside Center and reach it by different routes, with non-Schengen passengers first passing through immigration controls. The three airside terminals are:\n\nTerminal A \nTerminal A contains gates prefixed A. It opened in 1971, and it is used exclusively by flights to and from destinations inside the Schengen Area, including domestic flights within Switzerland. Since its expansion in 1982\u20131985, it takes the form of a finger pier, directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre.\n\nTerminal A was scheduled to be torn down and replaced by an entirely new facility from 2021. However in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the start of the project has been postponed for at least three years.\n\nTerminal B \nTerminal B contains gates prefixed B and D. It opened in 1975 and reopened in November 2011 after an extensive three-year reconstruction. Like terminal A, it takes the form of a finger pier directly connected at one end to the Airside Centre. Since reconstruction, it can accommodate both Schengen and non-Schengen flights at the same gates. Each gate has two numbers, one prefixed B and the other D, but with different passenger routes to and from the gates to separate the flows of Schengen and non-Schengen passengers.\n\nTerminal E \nTerminal E contains gates prefixed E, and is also known as the midfield terminal or Dock E. It is a stand-alone satellite terminal located on the opposite side of runway 10/28 from the Airside Center, and is situated between runways 16/34 and 14/32. It is entirely used by non-Schengen international flights and became operational and was opened on September 1, 2003. It is connected to the Airside Center by the Skymetro, an automated underground people mover.\n\nRunways\nZurich Airport has three runways: 16/34 of  in length, 14/32 of  in length, and 10/28 of  in length. For most of the day and in most conditions, runway 14 is used for landings and runways 16 and 28 are used for takeoffs, although different patterns are used early morning and in the evenings.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nThe following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Zurich Airport:\n\n{{Airport-dest-list \n\n|Aegean Airlines| Athens, ThessalonikiSeasonal: Heraklion, Rhodes\n\n| Aer Lingus | Dublin\n\n| Aeroflot | Moscow\u2013Sheremetyevo\n\n| Air Albania | Seasonal: Kuk\u00ebs\n\n|Air Cairo| Seasonal: Hurghada\n\n| Air Canada | Toronto\u2013PearsonSeasonal: Vancouver\n\n| Air Corsica | Seasonal: Ajaccio (begins 2 July 2022)\n\n| Air Europa | Madrid\n\n| Air France | Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle\n\n| Air Malta | Malta\n\n| Air Serbia | Belgrade\n\n| airBaltic | Riga\n\n| AlMasria Universal Airlines | Seasonal charter: Hurghada<ref name=\"abouttravel.ch\">\n\nStatistics\n\nBusiest routes\n\nTop airlines\n\nPassenger development\n\nGround transportation\n\nTrain\nZ\u00fcrich Flughafen railway station is located underneath the Airport Centre. The station has frequent Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn services, plus direct InterRegio, InterCity, and Eurocity services, to many places including Basel, Bern, Biel/Bienne, Brig, Geneva, Konstanz, Lausanne, Lucerne, Munich, Romanshorn, St. Gallen, and Winterthur. There are some 13 trains per hour to Z\u00fcrich HB (Hauptbahnhof), Z\u00fcrich's main city centre station, with a journey time of between 9 and 13 minutes. By changing trains there, most other places in Switzerland can be reached in a few hours.\n\nBus and tram\nIn front of the Airport Centre is the airport stop of the Stadtbahn Glattal, a light rail system that interworks with the Z\u00fcrich tram system, together with a regional bus station. Both the bus station and light rail stop provide service to destinations throughout the Glattal region that surrounds the airport, with the light rail stop being served by tram routes 10 and 12. Tram route 10 also provides a link to Zurich Hauptbahnhof, albeit with a rather longer journey time than that of the railway.\n\nRoad\nThe airport is served by the A51 motorway and other main roads, which link to the airport's own road network. Drop-off areas are available by the Airport Centre whilst a total of over 14000 spaces are available in six car parks for short and long term parking. A car hire centre is located in the terminal complex. The airport is served by a fleet of dedicated airport taxis, which operate from taxi ranks in front of the arrival areas. Alternative chauffeur driven airport limousines can be arranged.\nThe airport can legally be reached by bicycle on a regional highway (Flughafenstrasse and Birchstrasse) that branches off national highway 4 (Schaffhausen - B\u00fclach - Z\u00fcrich - Luzern) just east of the airport and reaches Northwestern Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOther facilities\n\nThe Circle\nThe Circle, a complex intended to include a medical center, a conference center, shops, restaurants, offices, and hotels, is under construction opposite the Airport Centre. In February 2009, Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG (FZAG) launched a three-stage architectural competition for \"The Circle at Zurich Airport\" development. Around 180,000 square meters of usable space for services were to be built close to the terminals on a 37,000 square meter site. Two hotels and the congress area will occupy around 45,000 square meters, which will be operated by the Hyatt Corporation. At the end of October 2011, FZAG submitted the building application to the town of Kloten, which granted the building permit on 6 March 2012. The groundbreaking ceremony for the superstructure, scheduled for the end of 2013, was postponed until the beginning of 2015. The Circle\" is expected to create around 5,000 new jobs, with an investment volume of around CHF 1 billion. The foundation stone was laid on 24 March 2017 and the opening is expected to take place in the first half of 2020; however, even then not all six parts of the building will be ready. In the meantime, it has been announced that the opening will take place in September 2020.\n\nCompany headquarters\nSeveral companies have their headquarters on or about the airport. These include Swiss International Air Lines, Swiss World Cargo, Swiss AviationTraining, Edelweiss Air, gategroup, Helvetic Airways, Swiss\u00f4tel, and Rega. Other companies that were formerly based on the airport include Swissair  and Crossair.\n\nSafety and environment\n\nAirport fire department\nThe airport fire brigade is responsible for fire-fighting at Zurich Airport and is on standby around the clock. In the event of an emergency, the brigade must be able to reach any location on the airport grounds, an area of 880 hectares, in no more than three minutes in accordance with international standards. Their vehicles have extremely powerful engines and large-capacity tanks.\n\nThe fire service also includes an operations control centre. This not only coordinates the airport's rescue services, but also alerts the fire brigades in the northern part of the canton. A total of 77 fire brigades are deployed from the Operations Control Centre, including 2 professional and 13 base fire brigades. Likewise, the rescue service Schutz und Rettung Z\u00fcrich Nord, the rescue service Spital B\u00fclach, the rescue service Winterthur and since April 1, 2008, the rescue service of the canton of Schaffhausen are also dispatched. Other tasks of the Operations Control Centre include alerting a large animal rescue service, a personal emergency call and location system and the coordination of the emergency medical service for several municipalities. In addition, 3800 fire alarm criteria are accumulated in the operations control centre. Every year, the operations control centre receives about 150,000 telephone calls.\n\nUntil 31 December 2007, the airport fire brigade was officially called the Berufsfeuerwehr Flughafen Z\u00fcrich (Professional Fire Brigade), and it was constituted as the company fire brigade of Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG. On 1 January 2008, the airport fire brigade, together with the rescue service and the operations control centre, was for organizational reasons transferred to the Schutz und Rettung (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zurich.\n\nThe airport fire brigade records more than 1000 operations per year. In 2004, 260 of these involved incidents involving aircraft, including emergency or safety landings.\n\nRefuelling dispenser, Ramp Safety, Airport Authority and Follow Me\nVehicles that not only cross taxiways and runways reserved for aircraft on the designated roads, but also use them for business purposes, must be equipped with a transponder and radio and can thus be tracked on tracking websites (e.g. Flightradar24). The transponder sign or radio name for the Follow-Me vehicles is Zebra.\n\nIn 2014, five companies were licensed for aircraft refuelling at the airport, operating 16 tankers and 28 dispensers.\n\nRescue service Zurich Airport\nThe rescue service at Zurich Airport was established around 1982 as the original \"fire-fighting ambulance\". Its primary purpose was to protect fire-fighting personnel during fire-fighting operations, and secondarily to provide medical care for injured passengers. It was quickly recognised that there was also a steadily growing need for rescue services for the population outside the airport, and often neighbouring hospitals that were able to provide this service could not cope due to capacity bottlenecks, or the corresponding structures were not available in the Z\u00fcrcher Unterland at the time. When the airport was privatized in 2000 to form the public limited company Unique (Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG), the rescue service was then separated from the fire service as a separate division within the Safety&Security department.\n\nIn the last year of its existence in 2007, the Rescue Service at Zurich Airport carried out around 5800 missions with 36 paramedics and three trainees. The majority of the operations were carried out in the region around the airport, which at that time comprised 28 contractual communities. There were three ambulances on standby during the day and two ambulances at night, which was carried out in two shifts of twelve hours each. The teams were on duty four times a day (twice a day and twice at night). As a novelty, Zurich Airport Emergency Medical Services consistently applied the amended labor law, i.e. it was one of the few employers to fully credit the working time of twelve hours without deductions (\"attendance time\"/effective working time).\n\nThere was no permanently installed emergency medical system at the airport site. The paramedics are equipped with extended skills that allow the administration of medication according to algorithms. As part of a quality control of the measures carried out, all operations were checked by the Medical Director. At the same time, an annual review of medication and algorithmic knowledge took place. Only after passing the written and practical test was the paramedic authorized to administer medication for another year. If an emergency physician was needed, the resources of the partner organisations REGA (helicopters) or the NEF of \"Schutz und Rettung Z\u00fcrich\" could be called upon.\n\nProject SUS After two project studies, Unique (Flughafen Z\u00fcrich AG) decided in the summer of 2007 to outsource the rescue service together with the operations centre and the professional fire brigade and to sell it to the Schutz und Rettung (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zurich for an amount of CHF 22 million. This was also due to the needs of the city of Zurich, as its professional fire brigade in particular had problems meeting the required arrival times with long journeys to the north of the city of Zurich. At the same time, it was possible to avoid the cost-intensive construction of a new base for rescue services and fire brigades in the rapidly growing north. A comprehensive contract was drawn up for the takeover of the entire department, which will be reassessed after ten years. The outsourcing resulted in massive internal restructuring, which replaced the previous organisational form. Since January 1, 2008, the base at the airport has been known as the \"Wache Nord\". With a strong positive operating result in 2007 and a reduced staffing level as of January 1, 2008, the catchment area of the rescue service expanded to include the northern districts of Zurich Schwamendingen, Seebach and Oerlikon.\n\nAccidents and incidents \n On November 24, 1951, a Douglas DC-4 of the Israeli El Al (aircraft registration 4X-ADN) on a cargo flight from Rome with textiles on board crashed into a forest three kilometers northeast of Zurich Airport shortly before landing. Six of the seven crew members were killed.\n On 24 November 1956, an Ilyushin Il-12B of the Czechoslovak airline \u010cSA (OK-DBP) crashed into an agricultural area 13 kilometres after take-off from Zurich-Kloten airport, only 500 metres from the southern outskirts of Wasterkingen, probably due to engine problems. All 23 passengers and crew members died there.\n On 4 September 1963, Swissair Flight 306 experienced an in-flight fire shortly after take-off and crashed, killing all 80 people on board.\n On 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine attacked El Al flight 432 whilst it prepared for takeoff. The aircraft's security guard repelled the attack, resulting in the death of one of the terrorists, whilst the Boeing 720's co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.\n On 21 February 1970, a barometrically triggered bomb exploded on Swissair Flight 330 some nine minutes after takeoff from Zurich en route to Tel Aviv and Hong Kong. All 47 occupants were killed. The bombing was attributed to the PFLP-GC.\n On 18 January 1971, an inbound Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Il-18D approached Zurich Airport in fog below the glideslope. It crashed and burst into flames,  north of the airport, when both left wingtip and landing gear contacted the ground. Seven crew members and 38 passengers were killed.\n On 24 November 1990, an Alitalia Douglas DC-9 operating Flight 404 crashed on approach to Zurich, killing all 46 passengers and crew on board.\n On 10 January 2000, a Crossair Saab 340 operating Flight 498 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 10 occupants. The cause of the crash was determined to have been the result of spatial disorientation and pilot errors.\n On 24 November 2001, a Crossair Avro RJ100 operating Flight 3597 crashed into hills near Bassersdorf while on approach to Zurich. Twenty-four of the 33 people on board were killed.\n On 15 March 2011, two Swiss A320s received almost simultaneous take-off clearance on the intersecting runways 16 and 28. In response to this serious incident, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation commissioned a comprehensive analysis of the operating procedures.\n On 27 September 2013 the nose landing gear of a De Havilland DHC-8-400 of Croatia Airlines could not be extended. The aircraft had taken off in Zagreb and was scheduled to land in Zurich. During the landing approach to Zurich Airport the pilots noticed that the nose gear of the aircraft was not extended. They tried for 40 minutes to extend the landing gear completely, but failed. The pilots decided to make an emergency landing in Zurich on runway 14, and none of the 60 passengers were injured in the subsequent landing at 8:17 pm. Runway 14 was then closed until the end of operations. After 15 minutes, air traffic on the two other runways could be resumed as usual.\n\nSee also\n Transport in Switzerland\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official website\n Ski Taxi & Airport Transfers\n \n \n \n\nAirports in Switzerland\nAirports established in 1948\nBuildings and structures in the canton of Z\u00fcrich\nKloten\nTransport in the canton of Z\u00fcrich\n1948 establishments in Switzerland", "machine_text": " Zurich Airport is the international airport of the city of Zurich in Switzerland.

He was also a key member of a number of bands that emerged from the no wave scene, including the Raybeats and the Golden Palominos.\n\nHarris has also recorded as a solo artist and with guitarist Robert Quine. In 1977, he joined Quine in a band backing rock critic Lester Bangs on Bangs' album, Let It Blurt, produced by John Cale. He was also briefly a member of the Voidoids and played on many recordings by a wide range of artists, including Matthew Sweet, Syd Straw, Kip Hanrahan and John Zorn.\n\nWith Quine, he composed all the music on their collaborative album, Escape, as well as co-writing virtually all the Raybeats' material. He also composed all the songs and instrumentals on his one solo album, except for one song co-written with Don Christensen.  As part of Anton Fier's supergroup the Golden Palominos, he co-wrote the majority of the songs on the band's acclaimed second album, Visions of Excess.\n\nCritical appraisals\nOne esteemed critic described Harris as a \"seasoned campaigner from the late-1970s flowering of American postpunk\", while another called him \"one of the most underrated guitarists\" on the New York scene.\n\nRobert Palmer, writing in the New York Times in 1987, praised \"the luminous clarity\" of Harris's lead guitar work for the Golden Palominos, while the Village Voice's Robert Christgau obliquely criticized what he called a \"weakness for the genre exercise\".

He has raced mostly in short track competition and as high as the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). Wimmer competed in the ASA Midwest Tour (now ARCA Midwest Tour) where he finished as high as second in his final season (2013). He has run a more limited schedule of touring events since.\n\nEarly career\nWimmer's career began in his youth, when he began working on his uncle, Larry Detjens' race car. Detjens was a champion late model racer who competed at Slinger Super Speedway and Wisconsin International Raceway. Detjens had the Slinger Nationals race trophy named after him after his death in 1981. Wimmer would work on his brother Scott Wimmer's cars after Scott started racing at age 14.\n\nHe began his racing career at age 17 while still in high school, racing pure stocks. He won the pure stocks track championship at State Park Speedway near Wausau in 1997. Later, he moved over to late models, and he won State Park Speedway's Larry Detjens Memorial Race in 2001. Participating in 149 races, Chris won 17 times and had 53 top five finishes. In 2001, he moved up to the American Speed Association (ASA), competing in more than 50 events over the next three years.\n\nNASCAR career\nOn January 9, 2004, Wimmer signed to drive for MB Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. Piloting the #63 Dave Porter Truck Sales Ford, Wimmer debuted at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway in early April. In the season he competed in twelve races; his best finish was 18th at Kansas Speedway. The following season, he was left without a ride before coming to an agreement with Green Light Racing in June 2005. He raced the #07 Chevrolet at the Milwaukee Mile. He would go on to race five more events for the team, occasionally switching to the #08 Chevy (which was unsponsored) and back to the #07, which had different sponsors in all four races Wimmer drove it. His best finish was 17th.\n\nDespite having only run in 17 Craftsman Truck races, he came to a three-year agreement with Keith Coleman Racing in early November 2005 to drive the #23 Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the Busch Series. He raced once in the 2005 season at Phoenix International Raceway and finished 37th after crashing. In 2006, Wimmer tried to compete for Busch Series Rookie of the Year, but after missing many races, he was released. He returned to the Truck Series to drive the #08 truck for Green Light at Milwaukee, but finished last after an electrical failure. Later in the season, he made one race at Dover International Speedway, finishing 43rd in the #79 Speedco Chevy. His final race of the year came at Texas Motor Speedway, when he drove the #76 Automotive Fabrication Chevy for Jeff Milburn to a 34th-place finish.\n\nIn 2007, he drove one more race for Milburn at Texas, where he finished 30th after an engine failure.\n\nPost-NASCAR career\n\nIn 2008, he began competing on the ASA Midwest Tour, finishing fourth in the season points. He had nine Top 10 finishes and was the fastest qualifier in two of 14 events. He was the only driver in the Top 5 in points to have no wins.\n\nWimmer operated State Park Speedway along with his father. He raced on the ASA series, continuing after it was renamed as the ARCA Midwest Tour,8 until finishing second in series points in 2013. He has also raced in events at State Park Speedway and other area tracks such as Marshfield Motor Speedway and Golden Sands Speedway. Wimmer competed in the 2014 Slinger Nationals. He raced up to second behind Dennis Prunty and took the lead late in the race when Prunty's car stopped running. Wimmer held off a late charge by Matt Kenseth to take the win. He won the final race in a three-race super late model Challenge Series at Madison International Speedway to take the track championship.\n\nIn May 2015, Wimmer took over as crew chief for Harrison Burton's Super Late Model replacing Freddie Query.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Zhuluo County\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Zhuluo County () was a political division in Taiwan from 1684 to 1787, during Qing Dynasty rule of the island. Initially encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan, the county shrank in size as the population and economy of the north and central western plains grew and new counties were created out of the developed areas; the Zhuluo county was eventually limited to a under-developed area in south-western Taiwan. In 1787 the county underwent further restructuring and was renamed Chiayi County.\n\nName\nThe city now known as Chiayi originally took its name from the aboriginal tribe who lived there: the Tirosen. The former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (), a representation of the original Formosan-language name. This town (in reality a village of perhaps one or two thousand people) gave its name to the surrounding area, dropping the -shan to leave Zhuluo as the name for the county as a whole. In some English-language texts the spellings Chu-lo or Choolo are used.\n\n1684\u20131723\nWhen the Qing wrested the island from the control of the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, Taiwan was made a prefecture under the administration of Fujian Province. This new Taiwan Prefecture included three hien or districts; Zhuluo County covered the central western plains and the north. \n\nThe county started as a catch-all for the areas not incorporated in one of the other, smaller, more developed counties. Zhuluo County was initially made up of four Villages () and 34 Communities ( - the name normally given to aboriginal settlements). The villages were all near the border with Taiwan County, with the communities making up the rest of Zhuluo County. At this point in time the county covered 18,499\u00a0km2, more than half the total area of Taiwan, with the county seat in the Jialixing area of Kaihua Village (modern-day Jiali District, Tainan).\n\nIn 1697 the Qing Imperial official Yu Yonghe visited the area and wrote that \"Zhuluo and Fengshan have no residents, only savages\" i.e. there were no Han Chinese settlements in the county. In 1694 there was only one registered market in Zhuluo as opposed to 17 in the far smaller Taiwan County, a situation which reflected the disparity in the Han Chinese populations in both counties.\n\nIn the first two decades of the eighteenth century Han settlers began to encroach more extensively into Zhuluo, with significant Chinese populations cultivating in the areas around modern-day Douliu and Changhua City. Settlers who attempted to move further north were however violently resisted by aboriginal tribes. In 1704 the administrative seat of the county was relocated to Zhuluoshan, today known as Chiayi City.\n\n1723\u20131787\nBy 1723, following the Zhu Yigui rebellion, the number of Han Chinese settlements in central and northern Taiwan had increased dramatically. To facilitate better administration Zhuluo was split into three. The northernmost section, corresponding to modern-day Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, and Miaoli County, was called Tamsui Subprefecture (\u6de1\u6c34\u5ef3). Changhua County (\u5f70\u5316\u7e23) was also created, encompassing the area of modern Changhua County, Taichung, half of Yunlin County and three townships of Nantou County. The remaining area, some 3,844\u00a0km2 from the Huwei River (\u864e\u5c3e\u6eaa) to the borders with Taiwan County and the ungoverned aboriginal areas, remained under the name of Zhuluo County.\n\nIn 1787, the Lin Shuangwen rebellion against Qing rule began, and rebels gained control of almost the entire island. Imperial troops regained control of the city and vicinity in 1788. In 1787, the county was renamed Chiayi County () to reflect the fidelity of the city during the incident.\n\nSee also\n History of Taiwan\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFormer counties of Taiwan\n1684 establishments in Taiwan\n1787 disestablishments in Taiwan\nQing dynasty", "machine_text": " Zhuluo County is a county in the southwest of Anhui Province, China. It is the westernmost county-level division of the province. Its population was 977,444 in the 2020 census and 962,451 in the 2010 census. The county is located in the south of the Dabie Mountains. The north of the county is higher in altitude, with the highest point being Mount Guanyin at 1, Junkuo, or Doushan, has an elevation of 887 metres (2,910 ft). The terrain slopes downward to the south and is much lower in altitude. The lowest point is in the southeast of the county, with an elevation of 40 metres (131 ft). Two major rivers flow through the county. The northwest-to-southeast-flowing Weishui River, a tributary of the Beijiang River, is the main river in the county. The other is the southwest-to-northeast-flowing Qingcomoti River, a tributary of the Weishui. Zhuluo is rich in mineral resources. More than 20 kinds of minerals have been discovered and exploited, including coal, iron, gold, copper, lead, zinc, phosphorus, and manganese. The area of present-day Zhuluo County was occupied for several thousand years. The No.1 and No.3 Neolithic cultural relic sites have been discovered in the county, with the No.3 site, named the Doushan Site, being the largest and most intact Neolithic cultural relic site in Anhui Province. The county was first established in 1725 during the Qing dynasty as \"Doushan County\", and was later renamed \"Zhuluo County\" in 1735. In 1928, after the Northern Expedition, the Chinese Soviet Republic, a communist regime, was established in Anhui Province. In 1931, the Chinese Soviet Republic was overthrown by the Kuomintang. During the Chinese Civil War, the county was taken by the Communist Party of China in May 1949. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the county was rearranged several times. In 1952, it was combined with Guichi County to form \"Guichi County\", and in 1958 it was transferred to He County. In 1961, it was separated from He County and was renamed \"Zhuluo County\". In December 2009, the county was hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2, causing one death and 21 injuries. In January 2013, a rare winter tornado hit the county, killing three people and injurin more than 130.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 30333837}

The user in this situation is billed after the fact according to their use of mobile services at the end of each month. Typically, the customer's contract specifies a limit or \"allowance\" of minutes, text messages etc., and the customer will be billed at a flat rate for any usage equal to or less than that allowance. Any usage above that limit incurs extra charges. Theoretically, a user in this situation has no limit on use of mobile services and, as a consequence, unlimited credit. This service is better for people with a secured income.\n\nPostpaid service mobile phone typically requires two essential components in order to make the 'post-usage' model viable:\nCredit history/Contractual commitment. This is the basis on which the service provider is able to trust the customer with paying their bill when it is due and to have legal recourse in case of non-payment\nService tenure. Most postpaid providers require customers to sign long term (1\u20133\u00a0year) contracts committing to use of the service.

Postpaid mobile phones are usually associated with long-term contracts between the customer and the provider. There are, however, a few ways to get a postpaid phone without a long-term contract. Postpaid mobile phones are the standard in many countries. The customer is given a bill at the end of each month which contains the total charges for that month. These charges are for the calls made during that month, and may also include charges for items such as phone rentals, voicemail, caller ID, long distance charges (if applicable), data usage (if applicable), and any other special services that may have been used during that month. There are a number of advantages to having a postpaid mobile phone. For one, the customer is not required to pay for services until they are used. This can be helpful for those who do not use their phones very often, or for those who have a limited budget. In addition, postpaid mobile phones often come with a number of features and services that are not available on prepaid phones. These can include caller ID, voicemail, and data services. There are also a number of disadvantages to having a postpaid mobile phone. For one, the customer may be subject to overage charges if they use more minutes than they are allotted in their plan. In addition, the customer may be charged for services they do not use if they do not cancel them in time.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"8 Women\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "8 Women () is a 2002 dark comedy musical film written and directed by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon. Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas, it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, Fanny Ardant, Virginie Ledoyen, Danielle Darrieux, Ludivine Sagnier and Firmine Richard. Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s, the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated, snowbound cottage only to find Marcel, the family patriarch, dead with a knife in his back. Trapped in the house, every woman becomes a suspect, each having her own motive and secret.\n\nOzon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor's film The Women (1939), but eventually settled on Thomas's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so. Drawing inspiration from Cukor's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as Douglas Sirk, Vincente Minnelli, and Alfred Hitchcock, 8 Women blends farce, melodrama, musical, and murder-mystery film while addressing murder, greed, adultery, and homosexuality. Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house, the film recreates much of the play's original theatrical feel. It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the history of film and the actresses' filmographies.\n\nThe film's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in Paris, where filming had taken place. 8 Women competed for the Golden Bear at the 52nd Berlin International Film Festival, where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution. Released to generally positive reviews, with major praise for the stars, the film was nominated for twelve C\u00e9sar Awards, including Best Film. At the 2002 European Film Awards, the film was nominated for six awards, including Best Film and Best Director; it won for Best Actress for the eight principal actresses. It was also selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 75th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.\n\nPlot\nThe film is set in the 1950s in a large country residence as a family and its servants are preparing for Christmas. When the master of the house is discovered dead in his bed with a dagger in his back, it is presumed that the murderer must be one of the eight women in the house. Over the course of the investigation, each woman has a tale to tell and secrets to hide.\n\nThe film opens with Suzon returning from school for Christmas break, finding her mother Gaby, her younger sister Catherine, and her wheelchair-bound grandmother Mamy in the living room, where most of the action of the film takes place. Their conversation drifts to the subject of the patriarch of the family, Marcel, and Catherine leads the first song of the film, \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (roughly, \"Dad, you're out of touch\"). The singing wakes up Suzon and Catherine's aunt Augustine, who initiates arguments with the rest of the family and the two servants (Madame Chanel and Louise), eventually returning upstairs and threatening to commit suicide. Mamy jumps out of her wheelchair trying to stop her, haphazardly explaining her ability to walk as a \"Christmas miracle.\" Augustine is eventually calmed down, and she sings her song of longing, \"Message personnel\" (Personal Message).\n\nThe maid takes a tray upstairs, finds Marcel's stabbed body, and screams. Catherine goes up to see what has happened and locks the door. The others finally go up to Marcel's room to see him stabbed in the back. Catherine tells the others that they should not disturb the room until the police arrive, so they re-lock the door. Realizing that the dogs did not bark the night before the incident, it becomes clear that the murderer was known to the dogs and therefore must be one of the women in the house. Attempting to call the authorities, they find that the telephone line has been cut, so they will have to go in person to the police station. Before they can do so, the women are distracted by the announcement that someone is roaming the garden, someone whom the guard dogs are not chasing. The person turns out to be Marcel's sister Pierrette, a nightclub singer who is also rumored to be a prostitute, and who has not been allowed into the house before due to Gaby's dislike for her. When questioned, she claims that she received a mysterious telephone call in which she was informed that her brother was dead. She sings \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (What's the point of living free?), commenting on her sexual freedom.\n\nIt is realized that she has been to the house before, as the dogs did not bark and she knew immediately which room belonged to her brother, making her the eighth potential killer. The women try to start the car, and find that it has been sabotaged, cutting them off from help until the storm subsides and they can hitchhike to town. The women spend their time trying to identify the murderer amongst them. It is learned that Suzon returned the night before to tell her father in secret that she was pregnant. She sings a song to Catherine, \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\"), about her lover; however, she was sexually abused by her father. We later learn that Suzon is not Marcel's child but is the child of Gaby's first great love who was killed not long after the child was conceived; every time Gaby looks at Suzon she is reminded of her love for him.\n\nSuspicion then swings to Madame Chanel, the housekeeper, whose actions the night before seem suspicious. It is revealed that she had been having an affair with Pierrette, who went to see her brother that night to ask for money to pay off her debts. When some members of the family react in outrage to the fact that she is a lesbian, Madame Chanel retreats to the kitchen, and sings \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (So as to not live alone).\n\nIn the meantime we find out that Mamy, Suzon and Catherine's \"old and sick\" grandmother, not only can walk but also possesses some valuable stock shares that could have saved Marcel from his bankruptcy. Out of greed, she lied that her shares had been stolen by someone who knew where she was hiding them. The spotlight moves to Louise, the new maid, who is found out to be Marcel's mistress. She declares affection for Gaby, but also expresses disappointment in her for her weakness and indecision. She sings \"Pile ou face\" (literally \"Heads or Tails\", but referring to the ups and downs of life), and removes the symbols of her servitude, her maid's cap and apron, asserting herself as an equal to the other women. Gaby sings \"Toi Jamais\" (Never You), about Marcel, saying that he never paid enough attention to her, while other men did. It is revealed that she had an affair with Marcel's business partner, Jacques Farneaux, the same man who has been having an affair with Pierrette. The two women get into a fight that turns into a passionate make-out session on the living room floor, a scene which the others walk in on and are stunned by.\n\nEventually, Madame Chanel discovers the solution to the mystery, but she is silenced by a gunshot. While not struck by the bullet, she becomes mute out of shock. Catherine takes the lead, revealing that she hid in her father's closet from where she saw all the other women talk to Marcel the night before. She explains the mystery: Marcel faked his own death, with her help, to see what was really going on in his house. She says that he is now free of the other women's clutches and rushes to his bedroom only to witness Marcel shoot himself in the head. Mamy closes the film with the song \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (There is no happy love) as the women clasp hands and face the audience.\n\nCast\n Danielle Darrieux as Mamy, the matriarch\n Isabelle Huppert as Augustine, her tachycardiac daughter\n Catherine Deneuve as Gaby, her other daughter, the victim's wife\n Fanny Ardant as Pierrette, the victim's sister\n Emmanuelle B\u00e9art as Louise, the new chambermaid\n Virginie Ledoyen as Suzon, the victim's elder daughter\n Ludivine Sagnier as Catherine, the victim's younger daughter\n Firmine Richard as Madame Chanel, the cook\n Dominique Lamure as Marcel, the victim, Gaby's husband\n Romy Schneider as the chambermaid's previous mistress (the photograph)\n\nMusical numbers\n \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (\"Dad, You're Out of Touch\") - Catherine and Company\n \"Message personnel\" (\"Personal Message\") - Augustine\n \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (\"What's the Point of Living Free?\") - Pierrette\n \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\") - Suzon\n \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (\"So as Not to Live Alone\") - Madame Chanel\n \"Pile ou face\" (\"Heads or Tails / Ups and Downs\") - Louise\n \"Toi jamais\" (\"Never You\") - Gaby\n \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (\"There is No Happy Love\") - Mamy\n\nProduction\nOzon was inspired by the 1950s Ross Hunter productions of Douglas Sirk and Alfred Hitchcock. To achieve the look of the latter two director's films, Ozon had costume designer Pascaline Chavanne fashion an original costume for each character. Chavanne was inspired by Dior's New Look and the earlier film costumes of Edith Head. Composer Krishna Levy also provided an instrumental score evocative of Bernard Herrmann, with touches of Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa and Elmer Bernstein, as well as a soundtrack featuring eight songs performed unexpectedly by the film's title characters.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\n8 Women received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 124 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. Its consensus states \"Featuring some of the best French actresses working today, 8 Women is frothy, delirious, over-the-top fun.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 64/100 rating, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJonathan Curiel of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that 8 Women was \"a movie that is so original, so funny, so alive with drama, intrigue, mystery and colors that you want to see it again and again\", citing it the \"new masterpiece\" in Ozon's filmography. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave 8 Women three out of four stars. He noted that the film \"is in no sense serious about murder, its plot, or anything else. It's an elaborate excuse to have fun with its cast,\" adding: \"Watching 8 Women, you have a silly grin half of the time.\" He concluded that \"Movies like 8 Women are essentially made for movie-lovers. You have to have seen overdecorated studio musicals, and you have to know who Darrieux and Deneuve and Beart and Huppert and Ardant are, to get the full flavor.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly felt that \"what does matter is that a phalanx of France's most famous actresses play a gay peekaboo with their own images in the guise of replicating a '50s technicolored production. The result is weightless entertainment that's both camp and true, a warped adoration of star-quality actresses as amazing creatures who can project the lives of fictional characters as well as the essence of their own fabulous selves. Hollywood, start your remake.\"\n\nThe Washington Post writer Ann Hornaday called the film \"a gorgeous, if disjointed, spectacle, made endurable\u2014if not entirely comprehensible\u2014by its eye-popping cast.\" She found that the picture \"retains a stagy quality of heightened theatricality\" and that \"with its bold, luxurious palette and hard-candy surfaces, the film seems less photographed than forged out of silk and nail lacquer.\" Rolling Stones Peter Travers concurred: \"All eight women are something to see and marvel at. Whatever you call this one-of-a-kind bonbon spiked with wit and malice, it's classic oo-la-la.\" He rated the comedy three out of four stars. A. O. Scott from The New York Times said, \"The high-minded critical term of art for such a decadent delight is 'guilty pleasure,' but a movie like this reveals that stuffy phrase to be both a redundancy and an oxymoron. 8 Women is indefensible, cynical, even grotesque; it is also pure\u2014that is to say innocent and uncorrupted\u2014fun.\" Less enthusiastic with the film, Salon.com wrote that \"despite the all-star cast of beautiful, talented actresses, this French whodunit never lives up to the grand musicals it rips off.\"\n\nSpecific performances were cited for acclaim. Huppert's portrayal of Augustine was met with praise. Curiel wrote that \"Huppert's song and dance\u2014and her whole performance in the movie\u2014is a study in determination. Huppert has a reputation for her intense portrayals, and in 8 Women, she steals every scene she's in as the uptight, melodramatic, bespectacled aunt.\" Ardant also received praise for her performance with Hornaday saying that \"the showstopper is Ardant, who in a sensational turn combining the earthiness of Ava Gardner and the fire of Rita Hayworth, explodes with an elemental force all her own. Ardant alone is worth the price of admission to 8 Women.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film was released on 6 February 2002 in France and opened at #3 in 493 theaters, grossing $5,246,358 in the opening weekend. It grossed $18,991,866 in the domestic market.

The film stars eight women in eight different stories, each dealing with the emotions and experiences of being a woman. The film was the first of its kind to be made by a female director, and was unique in that the stories were written, produced, and directed only by women. 8 Women was selected for the Sundance Film Festival in 1988, where it won the Audience Award for a documentary. It was also shown at the Berlin Film Festival, where it won a Silver Bear. The film is composed of eight monologues, each written and spoken by a different actress. The stories are told in the first person, and each woman's story is followed by a short silent film that serves as an illustration to the narrative. The stories cover many aspects of women's lives, such as the struggles with being a single mother, the pressures of being a beauty queen, and the experience of having an abortion. The film's title refers to the eight women who tell their stories, as well as to the fact that all of the women in the film are played by eight different actresses. The actresses who appear in the film are: Ellen Barkin, Carrie Fisher, Julie Harris, Anne Jackson, Sally Kirkland, Patricia Neal, Sydney Pollack, and Meryl Streep. 8 Women was released in the United States on September 30, 1988.

They used to dominate political life in Liberia and still have a lot of influence.\n\nThere are about 5,000 people of European descent, many of them having settled down as miners, missionaries, business people, and so on. There also is a sizeable number of Lebanese, Indians, and other people with Asian roots who make up a significant part of Liberia's business community. Because of the civil war and its accompanying problem of insecurity, the number of non-Africans in Liberia is low and confined largely to Monrovia and its immediate surroundings.\n\nThe Liberian Constitution restricts citizenship of Liberia only to people who are either 'Negroes or of Negro descent' wherein the Liberian Constitution / Chapter 4 / Article 27b states: \"In order to preserve, foster and maintain the positive Liberian culture, values and character, only persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent shall qualify by birth or by naturalization to be citizens of Liberia.\"\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish 20% (official), some 20 ethnic group languages, of which a few can be written and are used in correspondence.\n\nLiteracy\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write (2015 est.)\ntotal population: 47.6% (2015 est.)\nmale: 62.4% (2015 est.)\nfemale: 32.8% (2015 est.)\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\ntotal: 2.3% (2016 est.)\nmale: 2.4% (2016 est.)\nfemale: 2.2% (2016 est.)\n\nSee also\nLiberia\nList of countries by population growth rate\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nCiment, J.

Liberia's population is estimated at 4.7 million as of 2015. With this number, Liberia has the third largest population in Africa. Liberia has an average annual growth rate of 2.3 percent. As of 2015, Liberia is the country with the highest number of practicing Christians in the world. Muslims and followers of traditional religions make up much of the rest of the population. The country's main religions are Islam and Christianity. Liberia's main ethnic groups are the Kpelle, Bassa, Gio, Mano, and Kru. The Kpelle and Bassa, who speak Kpelle and Bassa languages respectively, are the largest and oldest groups in Liberia. The Gio, Mano, and Kru are collectively called the Kru-mano. They speak the Kru and Mano languages and live on the coastal plains and adjacent areas. The Grebo, live in the coastal counties of Maryland, Grand Kru, River Gee, and Grand Bassa. The Vai are mostly found in Grand Cape Mount County, but they can also be found in Bong, Lofa, and Nimba counties. The Krahn and Sapo are found in the forest region of Sinoe, Grand Kru, River Gee, and Grand Bassa counties. Many Liberians have joined the rest of the world in the usage of cell phones. As of 2008, the number of cell phones in Liberia was about 1 for every 4 people. In the capital city of Monrovia, the number of cell phones is about 1 for every 2 people. This has greatly improved the means of communication in Liberia.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 17794}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Death Magnetic\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Death Magnetic is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on September 12, 2008, through Warner Bros. Records. The album was produced by Rick Rubin, marking the band's first album since ...And Justice for All (1988) not to be produced by longtime collaborator Bob Rock. It is also the first Metallica album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo, and the second to share writing credit to all of the band's members.\n\nMetallica began writing music for a new album in 2006, later recording the album at different studios across Los Angeles County, California, from March 2007 to May 2008. Musically, Death Magnetic is a radical departure from Metallica's previous album, St. Anger (2003), and is considered a return to the band's thrash metal roots, with more complex compositions, standard guitar tuning on most songs and long guitar solos from Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. It also includes the band's first instrumental piece, \"Suicide & Redemption\", since \"To Live Is to Die\" from ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic made Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive number-one studio albums on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album received positive reviews, but its production was criticized as overcompressed and cited as a product of the loudness war. The album and its songs were nominated for six Grammy Awards (five in 2009 and one in 2010) and won three, including Best Metal Performance for \"My Apocalypse\". In support of the album, Metallica embarked on the World Magnetic Tour from October 2008 to November 2010. Four unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions were later released as the Beyond Magnetic EP in December 2011.\n\nProduction\n\nWriting\n\nEarly in 2004, lead singer James Hetfield revealed that Metallica had been playing new material during studio sessions, but that there was no mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, \"I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff when we get back to the studio in January.\" On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, it was reported that Metallica was planning to use the following six months to write material for the album, in addition to the previous two months they had already been spending writing music. Ulrich also stated that the band was getting along much better in the studio than they did during the recording of St. Anger. On April 6, he revealed that the band had composed \"six to seven\" songs (except for vocals) from their findings off the riff tapes recording during pre-sets of the Madly in Anger with the World Tour. He also said that by this point, the band's new material was reminiscent of \"old school\" Metallica works, and that it certainly did not feel like a St. Anger \"part two\".\n\nOn May 20, 2006, Kirk Hammett revealed that the band had fifteen songs written and were writing on average two to three songs per week. Hetfield also praised producer Rick Rubin for his production style in giving the band their own freedom and keeping the pressure at a minimum, despite the sessions becoming sometimes briefly unfocused. On May 27, Metallica updated their website with a video featuring information regarding the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThree studios were used to produce the album, those being Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California, and HQ in San Rafael, California. On January 1, 2007, Ulrich stated in an interview with Revolver that the band would be conceiving the album much like they did their albums prior to working with ex-producer Bob Rock; they would sit down, write a select number of songs, then enter the studio to record them. He also quoted Rubin by saying \"Rubin didn't want them to start the recording process until every song that they were going to record was as close to 100 percent as possible.\"\n\nOn March 5, Ulrich revealed that the band had narrowed a potential 25 songs down to 14, and that they would begin recording those fourteen on the following week. He also expanded on Rubin's style of production, saying,\n\nOn March 14, the band's official website issued a statement: \"Metallica left the comfort of HQ this week to descend upon the greater Los Angeles area to begin recording their ninth original album. This is the first time they've recorded outside of the Bay Area since they spent time at One-on-One Studios recording their self-titled album in 1990 and '91.\" This was confirmed on July 24, 2008, on Mission: Metallica, as a video surfaced showing the crew moving into Sound City Studios of Nirvana fame.\n\nOn June 4, Robert Trujillo revealed that only select portions of the two new songs debuted in Berlin and Tokyo respectively would be featured on the album. The band hoped to have the album finished by October or November, when the album would be mixed. He predicted the album would be out in February 2008, and revealed that the songs they were working with were quite long.\n\nOn February 2, 2008, Sterlingsound.com revealed that Ted Jensen from Sterling Sound Studios would be mastering the new record. According to Blabbermouth.net and other sources, Greg Fidelman, who had served as a sound engineer, had also been tapped to mix the album.\n\nUlrich confirmed on May 15, 2008, that Metallica recorded eleven songs for Death Magnetic, although only ten would appear on the album due to the constraints of the physical medium. The eleventh song, titled \"Shine\" (which was later retitled \"Just a Bullet Away\"), was a song Hetfield \"based around a Layne Staley type, a rock & roll martyr magnetized by death.\"\n\nUnreleased tracks\n\nA number of unreleased songs from Death Magnetic, including the above-mentioned \"Just a Bullet Away\", but also \"Hell and Back\", \"Hate Train\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\" were left off the album, but were rumored to be released as B-sides or on the next album. The titles were confirmed by Hammett and Ulrich on the MetOnTour video from December 20, 2008. On December 5, 7, 9 and 10, 2011, the band played four new songs, \"Hate Train\", \"Just a Bullet Away\", \"Hell and Back\" and \"Rebel of Babylon\", at the band's 30th Anniversary concerts. The day after each concert, MetClub members were sent an e-mail with a code for a free download of a rough mix of the song played at the show. The songs were released officially on the Beyond Magnetic EP, released on December 13, 2011. Two other songs recorded during Death Magnetic, based on \"The New Song\" (performed in 2006) and \"The Other New Song\" (performed in 2006 and 2007), have not been released, though parts of \"The New Song\" can be found in the recorded songs \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\".\n\nTitle\nKirk Hammett played a role in inspiring the album title by bringing a photograph of deceased Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley to the studio where Metallica was recording. \"That picture was there for a long time\", said Hammett, \"I think it pervaded James' psyche.\" Wondering why someone with Staley's talent would choose to use drugs so heavily and die so young, Hetfield started writing a song based on his questions (the song \"Rebel of Babylon\").\n\nOn July 16, 2008, Hetfield commented on the album's title:\n\nThe title is referenced in the track \"My Apocalypse\". According to Hammett, another title considered for the album was Songs of Suicide and Forgiveness. Death Magnetic was eventually picked out of four working titles when Hetfield met with creative agency Turner Duckworth, who were brought to deal with the album's visual identity, and as he discussed the songs \"it was clear that they were all linked to death, facing up to the nature of death, and the fear and attraction that surrounds death.\"\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nIn January 2008, a statement was made by Stereo Warning that the album would be delayed until September 2008, The album, which was completed on August 10, 2008, was released on September 12 in the United States and issued in a variety of different packages.\n\nOn September 2, a French record store began selling copies of Death Magnetic, nearly two weeks ahead of its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made prematurely available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor, Vertigo Records, to officially release the album two days ahead of schedule, on September 12. Ulrich, who was questioned about the leak on a San Francisco radio station, responded,\n\nHe later told USA Today,\n\nDuring their Escape from the Studio '06 tour, Metallica debuted two songs. \"The New Song\" debuted on the European leg in Berlin, Germany on June 6, 2006. The song, as performed, is approximately eight minutes long. The title was rumored to be \"Death Is Not the End\" as Hetfield repeatedly sings the line throughout the song. This song would appear again in multiple Fly on the Wall videos on the Mission: Metallica website, showing the band partway through the song's recording, as noted by the slower tempo and lack of lyrics. \"The Other New Song\", (which was later named \"Vulturous\") debuted on August 12, 2006, in Tokyo, and is much shorter, taking just below four minutes to perform. To the surprise of fans, Metallica played \"The Other New Song\" once again on June 29, 2007, in Bilbao, Spain. Although neither of the \"New Songs\" appear on the album themselves, \"The End of the Line\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" both contain elements of \"The New Song\".\n\nOn August 9, 2008, Metallica debuted the first album track, \"Cyanide\", at Ozzfest, in Dallas, Texas and was performed again on August 20, 2008, in Dublin, Ireland. On August 22, at the Leeds Festival, they debuted the first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\".\n\nOn July 31, 2009, it was announced on Metallica.com that the band felt that the song \"My Apocalypse\" was in need of an introduction when played live to \"set the mood\". The statement on Metallica.com reads, \"We've been enjoying playing 'My Apocalypse' out here on the road but felt like it could use something extra. We decided that it needed a cool intro to set the mood so James wrote one. Check out and enjoy this free download\u00a0... and make sure you learn it for singing along at a future show!\" The approximately minute-long introduction is available as a free MP3 download. The song had originally been debuted live on March 25, 2009, at the LG Arena in Birmingham, UK.\n\nOn the day of the release FMQB radio broadcast The World Premiere of Death Magnetic, which was heard on more than 175 stations across the US and Canada. The live program from Metallica HQ featured all four members of Metallica talking with Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins. Originally scheduled for a 90-minute broadcast, the show ended after two hours.\n\nPackaging and versions\nUlrich brought the agency Turner Duckworth, co-owned by his personal friend David Turner, as he wanted someone that \"would bring fresh ideas\", and commanded respect in branding but were not jaded by the music business\". While Turner and his partner Bruce Duckworth played with the two elements from the title, they emerged with the cover that combined a white coffin, a grave, and a magnetic field, depicted by a model made and photographed by Andy Grimshaw. Turner added the image was \"simple and literal but at the same time open to all sorts of interpretations\", saying that Hetfield considered the coffin shaped as \"a door, to another experience, or consciousness\". Duckworth stated that the cover fit their intention of something that would also be recognizable in a digital format, \"small icons that go on your phone or iPod\".\n\nTurner compared the Metallica project with a campaign they did for Coca-Cola, as both approaches went down to \"stripping things back down to what the brand was originally and the other part was adding a fresh new approach.\" The original Metallica logo was brought back to demonstrate how the band was trying to restore their old identity, while the cover was primarily white to contrast how the color is hardly used in the metal genre. Given the band wanted the physical release to be memorable to ensure it still had value in an age where audiences were purchasing more digital music, the original digipak featuring a layered die cut, where each page of the booklet resembled a layer of dirt being thrown on the coffin. Death Magnetic was issued on vinyl in a special box set, and also had a deluxe edition shaped like a coffin, bundled along with an additional disc full of demos, a making-of DVD, an exclusive T-shirt, guitar picks, a flag and a fold-out poster.\n\nGuitar Hero\nAlongside the release of the album, it was released as downloadable content (DLC) for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. This content would later be optimized for external use in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica (although \"All Nightmare Long\" was included on the in-game setlist), Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.\n\nThe Guitar Hero DLC had two versions of the instrumental track \"Suicide & Redemption\". The versions differed by the guitar solo performed on the song: one version had a solo performed by Hetfield, the other a solo by Hammett. The tracks were titled according to the solo they contained, with the Hetfield version named \"Suicide & Redemption J.H.\" and the Hammett version named \"Suicide & Redemption K.H.\"\n\nDue to technical restrictions, the Wii version of Guitar Hero: World Tour only could hold the three shortest songs of the eleven: \"Broken, Beat & Scarred\", \"Cyanide\" and \"My Apocalypse\". These songs also appear on the Wii and PS2 versions of Guitar Hero: Metallica as bonus songs instead of DLC. The eight remaining tracks (including both versions of \"Suicide & Redemption\") were released on November 24, 2009, as DLC for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero for Wii.\n\nTour\n\nMetallica promoted Death Magnetic with the World Magnetic Tour, which started on October 21, 2008, in Phoenix, Arizona. The North American leg finished in February 2009 and was followed by European concerts, interrupted only by a surprise gig at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas to promote the video game Guitar Hero: Metallica. A second North American leg, prioritizing markets missed by the original concerts, began in September. The tour returned to both continents while also extending to Latin America, Israel, Japan and Oceania in 2010, ending on November 21 in Melbourne, Australia. The 2010 Sonisphere Festival headlined by Metallica had them for the first time accompanied by the rest of the \"Big Four of thrash metal\", Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, and the concert where all bands played together for one song was released theatrically and on home video as The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria. Metallica also released in November 2009 two video albums out of World Magnetic Tour performances that year, Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n, y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico featuring three Mexico City concerts in June, and Fran\u00e7ais Pour une Nuit with a concert in the French town of N\u00eemes in July.\n\nReception\n\nIn a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, ex-Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum described his impressions of the unfinished songs:\n\nThe album's first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\", was described by BBC Music as the closest thing to a ballad on the album. Rock Sound has also compared it to the likes of Thin Lizzy. The band has abandoned the solo-free approach that they followed on St. Anger, returning to complex, multi-layered arrangements such as those typically found on the band's fourth album ...And Justice for All.\n\nDeath Magnetic has been praised by fans as well as critics as a comeback for Metallica after the widely panned St. Anger. Thrash Hits was one of the first websites, along with The Quietus, to comment on Death Magnetic, claiming \"it is a vast improvement on 2003 album St Anger\". Metal Hammer noted Death Magnetics \"sharp riffs\" and \"uncharacteristic bouncing grooves\", and favorably compares the band's sound on the album to bands like Slayer, Led Zeppelin and Rage Against the Machine. Former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy has praised the album, saying \"Death Magnetic is hands down the best Metallica album in 20 years. This is the CD I've been waiting for them to make since ...And Justice for All. And thumbs up to them for doing the first real Metallica instrumental in 20 years since 'To Live Is to Die'. Welcome back, boys.\"\n\nWhile Metallica was on the first leg of their 2008 tour in Europe, a third party at their management Q Prime demanded that media impressions and blogs commenting on the album be taken down from their website for reasons that were not explained to the band. However, when the band learned of this, they were upset and Ulrich re-posted many of the links along with other reactions to the new album, along with an apology to those whose links had been removed from Metallica's website.\n\nReviews for the album have been mostly positive. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated the album was like \"hearing Metallica sound like Metallica again\". Other positive reviews come from publications like The Guardian, who say that the album is \"the strongest material the band have written in 20 years\", and Uncut, declaring that \"like all the best heavy rock albums, it suspends your disbelief, demands your attention and connects directly with your inner adolescent.\" BBC Music's Chris Jones felt that Hetfield's lyrics had become \"the channel of his post-therapy angst\". The Observer stated \"it's a joy to have these gnarled veterans back to reinforce the sheer visceral thrill of timeless heavy metal\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, after a reviewer for Swedish daily Sydsvenskan admitted that he preferred a shortened mix of Death Magnetic to the official release, a scheduled interview was duly cancelled by Universal Music Sweden. Its president, Per Sundin said:\n\nCompression\n\nThe album has been criticized for having compromised sound quality, due to an excessively compressed dynamic range, leading to audible distortion. Sean Michaels of The Guardian explains that this is \"a result of the 'loudness war' \u2013 an ongoing industry effort to make recordings as loud as possible\". A Rolling Stone article states that Rubin was \"overseeing mixes in Los Angeles while the band is in Europe, headlining shows\" and only communicated with him by conference calls.\n\nFans have noted that these sonic problems are not present in the Guitar Hero version of the album, where the guitars, bass, drums, and vocals are presented separately due to the mechanics of the game. The tracks were sent to the game publishers prior to being compressed. As a result, fans have shared \"Guitar Hero\" versions of the album. MusicRadar and Rolling Stone attribute a quote to the album's mastering engineer Ted Jensen in which he claims that \"mixes were already brick-walled before they arrived\" for mastering and cite a petition from fans to remix or remaster the album.\n\nMetallica and Rubin initially declined to comment, while the band's co-manager Cliff Burnstein stated that complainers were in a minority and that response to the album had otherwise been \"overwhelmingly positive\". Ulrich later confirmed in an interview with Blender, that some creative control regarding the album's production had been transferred to Rubin but also stressed his satisfaction with the final product.\n\nIn 2015, the album was re-released on iTunes with a new \"Mastered for iTunes\" mastering which features an improved dynamic range and lack of distortion.

They happened on various occasions and anniversaries, in many locations across the country. A notable air show was the Tushino Air Show held annually in August.\n\nDates\n\nSoviet Air Fleet Day\nThe most frequent date of air shows was the Soviet Air Fleet Day (). It was also known as the Soviet Air Forces Day (), or Soviet Aviation Day. It was established in 1933 and was most usually held on the third Sunday of August, weather permitting. The initial exhibition on 18 August 1933, was a result of Yakov Alksnis initiative, and was held in Khodynka Aerodrome (the Central Moscow Aerodrome), but since the next year the show became located on Tushino airfield near Moscow, where it remained for entire decades. In 1937, the parade was attended by nearly a million people, observing the masses of aircraft spelling in the sky \"LENIN\", \"STALIN\" and \"SSSR\". The celebrations repeated until the fall of Soviet Union, and continue in Russia (location is now Zhukovskiy airport, see MAKS airshow).\n\nMay Day\n\n1 May was dedicated to multitude of parades throughout the Soviet Union. They often included large-scale flypasts.\n\nOther\nThe Soviet Air Fleet Day became primarily associated with Soviet Air Forces (VVS), so a separate day has been established for Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO) a second arm of Soviet military that employed numerous fighter squadrons. It was called Soviet Air Defence Forces Day (), occurred on the second Sunday of April, and was celebrated with air parades of lesser scale.\n\nThe October revolution anniversary usually included air parade, but as it was held on 7 November, the aircraft were often cancelled because of weather conditions. The same problem pertained to 19 November, the Soviet Rocket Forces and Artillery Day.\n\nNotably, the 50th anniversary of October revolution air show was held in the summer, on 9 July 1967 at Domodedovo airport. In an unprecedented display of air power, it featured twelve new types or variants of military aircraft, and prompted concern in the West.\n\nNotable first appearances \n\nThe Soviet air shows conveyed more than entertainment. In the atmosphere of harshly enforced clandestinity, these air shows were frequently the main source of information about the recent aviation achievements of Soviet design bureaus (OKBs). Both Eastern and Western public opinion benefited from it, as well as foreign military intelligence.\n\nSee also \n Air show\n Flypast\n Military parade\n MAKS (air show), the current biennial Russian air show\n\nReferences \n\nAviation in the Soviet Union\nSoviet Air Force", "machine_text": " A Soviet air show was an event where military aircraft of the Soviet Union would perform for the general public. These were quite different from the airshows of the West, being much more spectacular and intended to wow the audience with the might of Soviet military power. Although the first Soviet air show took place in 1912, they became much more frequent during the 1930s, when the Soviet Union began its first serious attempts at creating a domestic aircraft industry. These shows were used to demonstrate the latest Soviet aircraft, which were often experimental and not yet in service. During the 1940s and 1950s, many foreign delegations were invited to Soviet air shows to witness the latest Soviet aircraft. The most famous Soviet air show was the annual Victory Day flypast on 9 May, which was held on Moscow's Red Square. This grandiose event was intended to demonstrate the might of Soviet aviation and was often attended by senior Party and military leaders, as well as foreign delegations. The flypast traditionally began with a parade of fighters, followed by a formation of Soviet strategic bombers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union also held an annual \"Air Force Day\" on 23 August, which featured a flypast over Moscow's Tushino Airport. In the 1980s, Soviet air shows began to feature more exotic aircraft, such as the MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27, which were intended to demonstrate the latest Soviet military technology. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, many of these aircraft were sold to other countries, who continued to perform in air shows. Today, Russian aircraft continue to perform in international air shows, such as the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough Airshow.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31120417}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"WDRB\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "WDRB, virtual channel 41 (UHF digital channel 32), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Louisville, Kentucky, United States. Owned by Toledo, Ohio\u2013based Block Communications, it is part of a duopoly with Salem, Indiana-licensed dual CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate WBKI (channel 58). Both stations share studios on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard (near US 150) in downtown Louisville, while WDRB's transmitter is located in rural northeastern Floyd County, Indiana (northeast of Floyds Knobs).\n\nHistory\n\nAs an independent station\nThe first construction permit for channel 41 in Louisville was issued in 1953 to Robert Rounsaville, owner of WLOU (1350 AM), Louisville's first Black-oriented radio station. The station, if built, would have been the first Black-oriented TV station in the country. However, the construction of WQXL-TV depended on the success of the first of three planned stations, Atlanta's WQXI-TV, which failed and left the air in 1955. The permit remained active for several more years; the call letters were changed to WTAM-TV, and in 1963 the permit was sold to Producers, Inc., of Evansville, Indiana, but no station ever materialized. Producers was related to the Polaris Corporation, which in Louisville owned WKYW (900 AM).\n\nOn July 7, 1965, Consolidated Broadcasting Company, a group of five people from Chillicothe, Missouri with no television station experience (but were eventually shareholders for what would become ill-fated Kansas City independent station KCIT-TV), filed for a construction permit for the channel. The permit was granted on April 20, 1966, but it would be nearly five years before any station came to air. Antenna height issues and permitting setbacks caused delays for the new WDRB-TV and for a channel 21 permittee. Approval was finally obtained that summer, and Consolidated renovated a building that had housed a lithograph studio on East Main Street in the Butchertown neighborhood to serve as WDRB-TV's studios.\n\nWDRB-TV finally signed on the air on February 28, 1971, becoming the first independent station in the Louisville market. Initially, the station signed on at 3:00\u00a0p.m. on weekdays; its programming included low-budget afternoon children's programming and occasional news updates provided by anchor Wilson Hatcher, and, most notably, the Saturday night horror film strand Fright Night, hosted by local theater actor Charlie Kissinger. Not long after going on air, WDRB-TV debuted an afternoon children's program, \"Presto the Magic Clown\", hosted by Bill \"Presto\" Dopp. The station was profitable within months and tied then-ABC affiliate WLKY-TV in the ratings.\n\nBy 1976, WDRB-TV carried a mix of cartoons, westerns, outdoor shows and classic movies. The station's original owners sold the station for $6.5 million to the Minneapolis Star & Tribune Company (which later became the Cowles Media Company) in 1977. By that year, the station expanded its broadcast day to 11:00\u00a0a.m., with the addition of a four-hour block of religious programs; by 1979, WDRB-TV began signing on daily at 7:00\u00a0a.m.\n\nIn 1980, the station moved from Butchertown to its present location on Muhammad Ali Boulevard. However, WDRB-TV would eventually pull out of a contest for something it had sought since December 1977; a move from channel 41 to channel 21. In 1981, an administrative law judge had denied the application and preferred the competing bid from the Word Broadcasting Network, only for the FCC review board to overturn the decision.\n\nCowles exited television in the early 1980s. After selling its only other station, KTVH in Hutchinson, Kansas, it sold WDRB to Block Communications of Toledo, Ohio for $10 million in 1983. Under Block, WDRB-TV dropped the channel 21 application, clearing the way for WBNA to launch. Block began to increase WDRB's profile in the market by acquiring higher-rated and more recent off-network sitcoms and dramas to its schedule, along with a focus on the broadcast rights for the burgeoning athletic programs of the University of Louisville's Cardinals, which the station won in 1985 and held for two years.\n\nAs a Fox affiliate\nOn October 9, 1986, WDRB-TV became an affiliate of the Fox network and became known as \"Fox 41\" in late 1989. WDRB-TV became one of two Fox affiliates serving the Louisville market in 1990, when Campbellsville-based WGRB (channel 34, later CW affiliate WBKI-TV) affiliated with the network. Channel 34 served the southern portions of the market before it moved its transmitter farther north to service more of the market; WDRB became the sole Fox station in Louisville when WGRB became a WB affiliate in 1997.\n\nDuring the 1990s, WDRB shifted away from running older movies and classic sitcoms in favor of acquiring more talk and reality shows. In 1990, the station also regained rights to Louisville athletics in 1990 after the university spent three years with WHAS-TV and upgraded its transmitter, improving signal coverage. In 1994, Block Communications entered into a local marketing agreement to operate Salem, Indiana-based WFTE (channel 58, later WMYO, now WBKI); Block acquired WFTE outright in 2001, creating the first television station duopoly in the Louisville market. WDRB continued to carry cartoons through Fox Kids throughout the 1990s; the Fox Kids weekday afternoon lineup was discontinued at the end of 2001, when the remaining Saturday block moved to channel 58 until its successor 4KidsTV was discontinued by Fox in November 2008.\n\nOn April 21, 2007, WDRB became the first television station in Louisville to televise the Kentucky Derby Festival's all-day \"Thunder Over Louisville\" air and fireworks show in high definition\u2014which, at the time, was one of the largest technical undertakings ever attempted by an American television station. This was followed by a second\u2014even more elaborate\u2014\"Thunder\" telecast in HD in April 2008.\n\nThe station began phasing out the \"Fox 41\" branding in favor of simply branding by the WDRB call letters in May 2011. While this occurred shortly after sister station KTRV-TV in Boise, Idaho unexpectedly lost its Fox affiliation, station management stated that the rebrand was done in order to bring its branding in line with Louisville's other major network stations\u2013NBC affiliate WAVE (channel 3), ABC affiliate WHAS-TV (channel 11) and CBS affiliate WLKY (channel 32)\u2013who have all long branded with their call letters. Additionally, station management wanted to distinguish the station from Fox News Channel; WDRB is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references in their branding.\n\nIn early 2011, the master control operations for WDRB and WMYO were upgraded to allow the transmission of syndicated and locally produced programs in high definition; it also upgraded its severe weather ticker seen on both stations to be overlaid on HD programming without having to downconvert the content to standard definition.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, WDRB, WMYO and their respective subchannels were pulled from Insight Communications, what was then the market's major cable provider, as Block was unable to come to terms on a new retransmission consent agreement with Time Warner Cable (which purchased Insight in February 2012, but had not yet rebranded those systems under the latter until in 2013). The affected stations were restored on June 6, 2012, as a result of a new carriage agreement between Block and TWC.\n\nIn May 2013, WDRB began construction of an additional  of space at its Muhammad Ali Boulevard studio facility, including an expanded newsroom and sales area; the addition of two conference rooms; offices for finance and editing departments; and the addition of a secondary studio to be used for commercial and station projects. The $1.7 million expanded facility opened on May 5, 2014; as a result of the expansion, sister station WBKI-TV relocated their employees from that station's offices in the Kaden Tower into the WDRB facility.\n\nProgramming\nIn addition to carrying the entire Fox programming schedule, syndicated programs broadcast by WDRB include Live with Kelly and Ryan, Rachael Ray, Judge Judy and Dr. Phil.\n\nSports programming\nCurrently, all sports programming is provided by the network. However, for many years, WDRB had rights to University of Louisville Cardinals football and men's basketball games, some of which were syndicated through the Lorimar Sports Network or Raycom Sports packages of Metro Conference basketball games from the 1980s until the Metro Conference merger with the Great Midwest Conference to create Conference USA in 1995.\n\nWDRB also previously broadcast some University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball games at some point during the 1990s.\n\nNews operation\nWDRB presently broadcasts 57\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9\u00bd hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the broadcast television stations in the Louisville market and in the commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nAfter more than a year of planning, WDRB launched its news department on March 12, 1990, with the debut of a half-hour 10:00\u00a0p.m. newscast originally titled The News at 10. Many longtime news personalities in the Louisville market joined the new WDRB news staff when the station formed its news operation; many others have joined channel 41 from other stations since that time. The News at 10 was originally anchored by Lauretta Harris (who joined WDRB from WAVE), Jim Mitchell (who started in the market at WHAS-TV, before moving to WAVE), meteorologist Tammy Garrison, and sports anchor David Sullivan.\n\nIn 1995, the program was retitled as Fox News at 10 and expanded to one hour and added weekend editions on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Bill Francis (formerly of WLKY) and Susan Sweeney (formerly with radio station WHAS (840 AM)) joined the staff as anchors of the weekend newscasts; Tara Bassett (who had previously worked at WAVE) was the weekend weather anchor. The station launched additional newscasts on its schedule as its ratings position in the market strengthened: the first news expansion outside its established 10:00 slot came on October 5, 1998, when WDRB premiered the three-hour-long Fox in the Morning and a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30\u00a0a.m. (originally titled Fox First News); the latter program expanded to an hour on September 21, 2015, with the addition of a half-hour noon newscast. This was later followed by the debut of an hour-long 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast in September 2001.\n\nIn June 2002, WDRB became one of the few U.S. television stations to run a regular editorial segment, when it debuted \"Point of View\", a twice-weekly segment that is usually hosted by WDRB/WMYO president and general manager Bill Lamb; the segment introduced a weekly feature with viewer responses to the discussed topic via phone message in 2007. \"Point of View\" has evolved into one of the community's most prominent opinion forums, featuring frequent guest editorials by a wide array of community members. In 2006, WDRB\u2014in partnership with Norton Healthcare\u2014became the first and only station in Louisville to offer real-time closed captioning on all of its newscasts, making 100% of the station's news content available to over 147,000 deaf or hard of hearing viewers in the market. Prior to this, only pre-written studio-originated content was closed-captioned, while live field reports and breaking news stories were not transcribed.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, WDRB became the second television station in Louisville market (after WAVE) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; it was the first (and presently, the only) television station in the market to provide news video from the field in true high definition, as WDRB upgraded its ENG vehicles, satellite truck, studio and field cameras and other equipment in order to broadcast news footage from the field in high definition, in addition to segments broadcast from the main studio. By comparison at the time, WAVE only broadcast studio segments in HD, while field reports are presented in widescreen standard definition, while WHAS-TV and WLKY were still broadcasting in SD, stretched to fill 16:9 widescreen sets.\n\nOn January 17, 2011, WDRB launched a half-hour early evening newscast at 6:30\u00a0p.m. each weeknight (it is the only station in the United States that currently airs newscasts during the 4:00 and 6:30\u00a0p.m. timeslots); the program expanded to an hour-long broadcast on September 22, 2014, with the addition of a half-hour newscast at 6:00. WDRB began producing a half-hour weeknight 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on WBKI-TV on September 17, 2012; this was the result of a local marketing agreement that was forged between Block and WBKI-TV owner LM Communications, LLC (as such, WDRB is one of only a handful of Fox stations that produce a newscast for another station in the same market, among which include KCPQ in Seattle (which produces a 9:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KZJO) and KTVU in San Francisco (which produces a 7:00\u00a0p.m. newscast for sister station KICU-TV)); the WBKI newscast was canceled on September 19, 2015. On January 26, 2013, the station debuted a three-hour weekend morning newscast, airing Saturdays and Sundays from 6:00-9:00\u00a0a.m. On May 7, 2019, it was announced that WDRB had hired long-time WAVE anchor Scott Reynolds to anchor a new hour-long 5:00\u00a0p.m. newscast starting in September 2019.\n\nIn June 2013, WDRB gained notice in the television industry when it debuted a promo criticizing the broad, constant and generalized use of the term \"breaking news\" by other news stations (both within the Louisville market and around the United States), stating that \"breaking news\" has been overused as a \"marketing ploy\" by other stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, WDRB posted on its website a \"contract\" outline of its journalism practices with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to judiciously use \"breaking news\" (applying the term to stories that are \"both 'breaking' and \"news'\"), as well as a general promise to deliver news in a truthful, balanced and informative manner, and without overt hype and sensationalism.\n\nJune 2019 saw Bill Lamb departing the station after his successes with WDRB, and becoming the general manager of Fox Television Stations' West Coast flagship duopoly of KTTV and KCOP-TV. Ricky Joseph from fellow Block station WAND will serve as an interim president/GM until Lamb's replacement is found.\n\nThe station gained national attention in November 2019 for a sweeps interview with the founder of Papa John's Pizza, John Schnatter (who had been a controversial local figure since his July 2018 ouster over use of a racial slur on a conference call). Schnatter had made the claim to WDRB's Stephan Johnson that he had found the quality control of the chain had declined after saying he ordered forty pizzas to eat from it in a month long period, and warned of a 'day of reckoning' for company board member Mark Shapiro for participating in Schnatter's ouster from the company.\n\nTechnical information\n\nSubchannels\nThis station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nIn late 2010, Block Communications began testing digital subchannels on both WDRB and WMYO; on or about January 30, 2011, WDRB began carrying the Tribune Broadcasting-owned Antenna TV network over its second digital subchannel. WDRB-DT2 was added to Insight Communications systems in the area on digital channel 187 on April 20, 2011. On March 1, 2017, WDRB added a third digital subchannel carrying Ion Television on WDRB-DT3, after previous affiliate WBNA became an independent station, and eventually upgraded it to Ion's default 720p high-definition presentation (with the added advantage of few to no preemptions of Ion programming, which WBNA did regularly).\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nWDRB discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 41.\n\nOut-of-market coverage\nWDRB had previously been carried on many cable systems in areas adjacent to the Louisville market, including Kentucky's capital city, Frankfort. The channel was the first one sequentially on Frankfort's channel lineup (on channel 2), and was the sole source for Fox programming in HD in the capital city until 2012. On January 1, 2012, WDRB was removed from most cable systems outside of the market as a result of a corporate directive from Fox as part of its new affiliation agreement that forbade WDRB from being distributed on providers outside of its home market to protect ratings for the network's affiliates in nearby markets; this rule has been a source of conflict in several other markets, which have had out-of-market Fox affiliates from adjacent areas pulled from local cable providers. A few months later, the station removed the county outlines of Anderson and Franklin counties in Kentucky (the westernmost counties in the Lexington television market) and Switzerland County in Indiana (within the Cincinnati television market) from weather maps and severe weather alert displays; as a result, WDRB became the only Louisville area station that did not recognize Frankfort as being part of its viewing area. Despite this, Frankfort and Lawrenceburg are still occasionally mentioned during on-air weather segments. On December 20, 2017, the main cable provider in Frankfort, the Frankfort Plant Board, announced WDRB's return to their channel lineup, mainly for local news coverage, in 2018. Beginning sometime in April, WDRB returned on channels 4 and 504 in HD providing local news and syndicated programming while replacing Fox network programming with a cropped simulcast of Antenna TV from WDRB-DT2. At the same time, FPB began carrying the Antenna TV feed from WDRB-DT2 outright on channel 28, replacing the feed from WLJC-DT3 which had, in turn, replaced WTVQ-DT6 in early 2018 when Lexington's Antenna TV affiliation moved. WDRB was removed once again on January 1, 2021 after FPB and WDRB were unable to come to an agreement to continue carriage of the station, though this disagreement was based on financial differences rather than a network rule.\n\nIn the eastern half of the Bowling Green market, WDRB was carried on the Glasgow Electric Plant Board and South Central Rural Telephone Cooperative's cable system, despite the Glasgow area being in closer proximity to the viewing area of Nashville affiliate WZTV. However, blackouts of Fox programming by WBKO-DT2 were common, as was the blackouts of ABC programming from WHAS-TV were caused by WBKO's main channel. SCRTC and Glasgow EPB both dropped WDRB, WDRB-DT2 and WMYO in January 2015, with WDRB's main channel being dropped due to the presence of Fox affiliate WBKO-DT2; WMYO and WDRB-DT2 were respectively replaced by WCZU-LD, an upstart station serving as a primary MyNetworkTV and secondary Antenna TV affiliate. Both WBKO-DT2 and WCZU-LD claimed exclusivity in terms of Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliates on the Glasgow-based cable systems.\n\nWDRB remains available to Mediacom customers in Hart and Metcalfe counties. It is also available on Charter Spectrum channel 70 in the Owensboro and Henderson areas, as well as on Crystal Broadband Networks in Lewisport.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWDRB official website\nFright Night program info\n\nFox network affiliates\nAntenna TV affiliates\nIon Television affiliates\nNewsy affiliates\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1971\nDRB\n1971 establishments in Kentucky", "machine_text": " WDRB, virtual channel 41 (UHF digital channel 30), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, and has studios onSamples Lane (just off U.S. Route 42) in Mount Washington; the station's transmitter is located on Fern Valley Road, near the I-264/I-64 interchange. WDRB is a primary Fox station, although it had been a primary CBS station for much of its history. It became a Fox affiliate in 1996, when its former parent company, Sarkes Tarzian, Inc., signed an agreement with Fox to affiliate all of its television stations with the network. It was the first network-affiliated television station to sign on in the Louisville market, doing so in 1971 as an independent station. WDRB's relationship with CBS dates back to its earliest days. As the station was being built, it was initially planned to be a semi-satellite of WSBK in Boston, in order to provide the Boston station with additional programming and advertising inventory. However, the station's license was ultimately awarded to a separate company, which chose to affiliate with CBS. WDRB maintained a secondary NBC affiliation for much of the 1980s, although it had to rely on the network's national feed for most of its programming, as its signal did not reach the home territories of many of NBC's most popular shows.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 872769}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ars Electronica\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ars Electronica Linz GmbH is an Austrian cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of new media art, founded in Linz in 1979. It is based at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC), which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of Linz. Ars Electronica's activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts R&D facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the Prix Ars Electronica awards.\n\nHistory\n\nArs Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, Hubert Bognermayr, Herbert W. Franke, and Ulrich R\u00fctzel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz GmbH was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodeled in 2009.\n\nFunding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. Since 2014, the organization has been headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nThe top of the AEC is called the Sky Media Loft, which is mainly used as a coffee house or bar of the museum. It can also be rented out for meetings or events. The bar has occasionally been used as the studio for the newscast of the local TV branch of the Austrian national TV organization ORF. The specialty of the Sky Media Loft is the marvelous view over the Nibelungenbr\u00fccke and the main place of Linz at the other side of the Danube which functions as background of the newscasts.\n\nThe second floor is where people can interact with exhibits. There are Musicbottles containing different types of music or Pingpongplus which is a table tennis game on a desk with virtual water on its surface.\n\nThe first floor has displays about the world that had been hidden from our eyes. In the \"Hidden Worlds\" various machines are translating voice and words into virtual symbols or colors and everyday life articles can be moved on a screen if they are touched.\n\nThe little room between the first and the ground floor one of the main attractions is offered. The flight simulator \"Humphrey\" uses virtual reality goggles to give users a simulated view of the flight and the person taking the trip is connected to the computer by cables fixed all over the body. It is possible to fly everywhere and to see the movements of the hands, feet, and the landscape if the visitor raises the head or looks down.\n\nThe entrance or the so-called \"Login Gateway\" of the museum is on the ground floor and leads the newcomer directly to the Telegarden, where a robot is looking after a flower patch. Every ticket is provided with a bar code that gives information about the time the visitor entered the museum. After the visit, the ticket can be put into a computer near the exit and it gives statistic information about the things that happened in the world during the span of the stay in the AEC. The list that is printed out gives information about how many people died or were born during that time or how many accidents have been caused by drunken drivers.\n\nThe last floor is called Virtual Reality and it can be found in the basement of the building. The CAVE is another attraction of the museum. The cube with 3 meters side length is used as a screen to project the virtual world. There are always groups of about 10 that dive into a world where physical laws do not have any meaning. Additionally, the 3D spectacles give the impression of a bodyful environment.\n\nMuseum 2009\u2013present\nThe new Ars Electronica Center, which was designed by Treusch architecture ZT GmbH, opened its doors on 2 January 2009 after roughly two years of construction work and an approximate cost of 30 million euros. It now has 3000 square meters for exhibitions, 100\u00a0m2 for research and development, 400\u00a0m2 for workshops and conferences, 650\u00a0m2 for catering and another 1000\u00a0m2 of public space for various types of events.\n\nThe new AEC consists of the original building, a new \"twin-tower\", the main exhibition hall called Main Gallery and the new space for the Ars Electronica Futurelab. The whole building is covered with a 5000-square-meter glass skin that consists of 1100 glass panels. Each panel is equipped with an LED bar that allows it to change its color. Therefore, the whole building acts as a giant display. Artists can create their own visualizations which will be shown on various occasions, especially during the Ars Electronica Festival.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the third floor of the new building and is called CUBUS, referring to the building's cubic shape.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nWith the new building came a new thematic orientation inside of Ars Electronica. Life sciences, global developments (e.g. climate change, population growth, environmental pollution) and the exploration of the universe are just a view of various new topics.\nThe museum can be separated into the following areas:\n\nMain Gallery \nThe Main Gallery with approximately 1000 square meters houses the main exhibition called New Views of Humankind, which focuses on topics like biotechnology, robotics, rapid prototyping and the human body. It is separated into the following four so-called \"labs\":\n\nBrain-Lab focuses on the human brain, perception and advances in medicine.\nBio-Lab focuses on biotechnology and its applications.\nFab-Lab deals with new possibilities offered by 3D printers and rapid prototyping.\nRobo-Lab deals with robotica as well as different prothetic systems.\n\nMain Gallery contains a special area for children which is not thematically connected to the main exhibition.\n\nGeo City \nGeo City focuses on global developments caused by humankind, like growth in population and the extraction of natural resources. Those global developments are connected with possible local reactions, which is visualized in an interactive city information system called Sim-Linz.\n\nArtists, Creators, Engineers \nThis is the area for temporary exhibitions on the first and second floor of the original building and focuses on the interdisciplinary aspects of Ars Electronica and its contributors.\n\nDeep Space \nThe Deep Space is a multifunctional presentation room that offers a wide range of possibilities. It consists of two walls (front and floor) with dimensions of 16\u00a0\u00d7 9 meters which serve as screens for eight Galaxy NH-12 projectors by Barco. The projects range from high-resolution videos to scientific (3D) visualizations like a flight out from the solar system to the whole known universe and artistic projects.\n\nFutureLab \nThe same building holds the Ars Electronica FutureLab, a place for researching and trying out new cyberarts technologies.  See also the Prix Ars Electronica, a yearly award ceremony given out by Ars Electronica at their cyberarts festival.  Since 2004, one of the awards at the Prix Ars Electronica brings a young innovator or team of innovators to the FutureLab for a summer to develop a budding idea or technology in electronic media.\n\nFestival\n\nThe annual Ars Electronica Festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as \"a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention\". The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.\n\nEach year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, had as its theme \"C... What it Takes to Change\", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.\n\nFeatures at the 2014 festival\n\nDevice art\n\nA form of concept art, device art has been described as \"a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different\". Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:\n \"Otamatone\" \u2013 a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.\n \"Food Simulator\", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.\n \"Lenticular Bicycle\" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as \"Sustainable Cinema No. 2\" and created by Scott Hessels.\n A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.\n \"Touchy\", a \"human camera\", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.\n\nSmart atoms (spaxels)\nA version called \"Smart atoms: spaxels version\" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival.\n\nPrix Ars Electronica\n\nThe Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, \"honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media\". Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation. Grover (2008) has described the top-ranking award, the Golden Nica, as \"the Oscar of digital art\".\n\nThe prize was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014, there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries. All entries remain on display in an online archive, the Prix Ars Electronica Showcase, containing over 55,000 items.\n\nAward categories\nAwards of the Golden Nica (worth 10,000 euros), Awards of Distinction, and Honorary Mentions are made in the following categories:\n Computer animation / Film / VFX (First presented in 1987)\n U19 Create Your World (First presented in 1998)\n Visionary Pioneers of Media Art\n Interactive Art\n Digital Music & Sound Art\n Hybrid Art (First presented in 2007)\n Digital Communities (First presented in 2004)\n Artificial Intelligence & Life Art (First presented in 2019)\nNote: \n\nThere is also a grant scheme to honor and support ideas of exceptional promise. It is known as \"[the next idea] voestalpine Art and Technology Grant\".\n\nSome notable award winners\n 1987: \"Luxo Jr.\", dir. John Lasseter of Pixar (Golden Nica \u2013 Computer Animation).\n 1990: \"Videoplace\", by Myron Krueger (Golden Nica \u2013 Interactive Art)\n 1994: \"Jurassic Park\", by Dennis Muren, Mark Dipp\u00e9 and Steve Williams (Golden Nica \u2013 Computer Animation)\n 1999: \"The Difference Engine #3\", by Lynn Hershman (Golden Nica \u2013 Interactive Art)\n 2004: Wikipedia (Golden Nica\u2013 Digital Communities)\n 2005: Processing, a programming language and environment designed for the electronic arts (Golden Nica \u2013 Net Vision)\n 2007: SymbioticA, University of Western Australia Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory (Golden Nica \u2013 Hybrid Art)\n 2008: The Reactable by Sergi Jord\u00e0 and others (Golden Nica \u2013 Digital Music)\n 2009: WikiLeaks (Award of Distinction \u2013 Digital Communities)\n\nArs Electronica Center\nThe center is housed in a modern complex of buildings by the Danube. It acts as Ars Electronica's permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.\n\nThere is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&D. The center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz's term as European Capital of Culture. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.\n\nArs Electronica Futurelab\nThe Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies. It is staffed by about 35 permanent team members, and offers residencies to established and emerging artists and researchers.\n\nThe Futurelab has produced infrastructure and content for the Center and Festival. More recently it has engaged in art&science projects with universities and the private sector.\n\nSpaxels \nThe spaxels (\"space pixels\") have been shown publicly as a world premiere in 2012 by Ars Electronica Futurelab. Spaxels are the single elements that form a drone display. Automatically controlled drones fitted with LEDs (= spaxels), fly in formation to create apparent three-dimensional objects against the night sky.  Spaxel ref. Wiktionary\n\nComment\nTrent Nathaniel Grover has included an appendix about Ars Electronica in his book Dream of the Techno-Shaman (2008). He describes the institute's activities as \"a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society\". Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as \"beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology\". Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the Modernist call for \"art for art's sake\".\n\nGrover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica \"will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society\".\n\nPublications\nGrover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as \"a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact.\"\n\n Cyberarts 98: .net, Interactive Art, Computer Animation/Visual Effects, Computer Music, U19/Cybergeneration.

It was founded in 1979 by Herbert W. Franke, Hannes Leopoldseder, and datakitchen (Birgit Williams and Michael Shaver). The roots of Ars Electronica are in the Cybernetic Art Society, which was formed in Vienna in the mid-1970s by a group of artists and scientists who were interested in utilizing computers and video equipment to realize artistic ideas and visions. In 1979, the first Ars Electronica exhibition took place in the dentistry clinic of the University of Vienna. The exhibition was opened by the then-chancellor of the university, KnoxHEPA air filter, and the president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Herbert W. Franke. In the following year, 1980, the Ars Electronica Festival was held for the first time. The exhibition and festival have since been an annual event. In 1987 the term \"Ars Electronica\" was coined by the German philosopher and scientist Hans-Peter D\u00fcrr. In 2013, the festival and the exhibition were combined into one event, the Ars Electronica Festival. The Ars Electronica Center was opened in Linz in 2009.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44119867}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Drake Bulldogs men's soccer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Drake Bulldogs men's soccer team represent Drake University in the Missouri Valley Conference of NCAA Division I soccer. The team plays its home matches at Cownie Sports Complex on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa and is coached by Scotsman Gareth Smith.\n\nHistory\nThe Drake program began in 1986. Under coach Bob Wood, the Bulldogs would compile a 16\u201316 record over two seasons as an independent before joining the Big Central Soccer Conference for the 1988 season. After a three-year run in the BCSC saw Drake post a collective 29\u201325\u20134 record (8\u20137\u20133 in conference), the Bulldogs would join their traditional sporting conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, for the 1991 season.\n\nUpon joining the MVC, the Bulldogs went 6\u201310\u20130 (1\u20132\u20130) in 1991 season and 6\u201312\u20132 (2\u20132\u20131) in 1992. The Bulldogs would bounce back to post three consecutive winning seasons for the first time in school history from 1993 to 1995 (including a record-best 4\u20132\u20130 mark in 1994 MVC play). During his final seasons, Wood's teams totaled a combined 14\u201321\u20131 record in 1996\u20131997.\n\nFor the 1998 season, Drake hired Swiss-born Canadian, 32-year-old Evansville assistant Sean Holmes. In 1998, the Bulldogs earned a 6\u201311\u20131 mark. In 1999, Drake went 4\u201313\u20131 (1\u20135\u20131).\n\nFor the 2003 season, the Bulldogs moved from the larger Drake Stadium into the more-intimate off-campus Cownie Sports Complex, and Holmes began to turn the program around, guiding the Bulldogs to a 4th-place finish in the conference, good enough to host a quarterfinal match in the conference tournament. The 2003 squad achieved the first top 25 ranking in the program's history. The 2004 squad would begin the season ranked for the first time in school history, and the 2005 season saw victories over three ranked opponents, including a win over then-sixteenth-ranked Creighton for the first time in school history.\n\nIn 2008, Holmes' Drake squad had a breakout season. Drake would win a school-record 13 matches (against 5 losses and 1 draw) and earned an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time. Drawn into the Queens, New York region of the bracket, the Bulldogs would battle hard at Saint Louis before falling on a goal just 4.1\u00a0seconds away from penalty kicks.\n\nThe 2009 season saw Holmes' team take the program to new heights. Hosting the Missouri Valley Conference tournament after finishing second in the regular season, the Bulldogs edged third-seeded Creighton, 2\u20131, before defeating fourth-seeded Evansville, 2\u20131, to win the school's first-ever conference tournament title and clinching their second consecutive College Cup appearance. In the tournament, the Bulldogs would earn their first-ever NCAA victory with a 2\u20131 win over Western Illinois and then stunned fourth-seeded Ohio State 1\u20130 to advance to the Sweet 16 In the Sweet 16, after falling behind 2\u20130, the Bulldogs rallied to a stunning 6\u20134 win at Boston College before falling in a 2\u20131 heartbreaker to No. 5 North Carolina in the national quarterfinals.\n\nHours before the start of the 2015 season, Drake announced that assistant Gareth Smith would replace 17-year head coach Holmes to become interim head coach. Smith was promoted to head coach after Drake finished 3rd in the MVC regular season. The 3rd seeded Bulldogs then won three consecutive matches in the conference tournament to earn the conference's automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship. In the tournament, the Bulldogs knocked of No. 17 Kentucky 2\u20131 in the first round before falling to former MVC member Creighton in the second round.\n\nAll-Time record\n\nSeasons\n\nNotable former players\nThe players in bold have senior international caps.\n\n  Ezra Hendrickson featured for six different Major League Soccer (MLS) clubs, was a three-time MLS Cup winner (2002, 2004, 2008), and earned 123 international appearances with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines before serving as an assistant coach with several MLS clubs\n  Aaron Leventhal played for the Minnesota Thunder of the USL A-League from 1995\u20132001\n  Kirk Wilson was selected in the first round of the 1999 MLS Supplemental Draft and played for the Dallas Burn of Major League Soccer and the El Paso Patriots, Rochester Raging Rhinos, and Impact de Montreal of the USL A-League and USL First Division\n  Matt Nickell was selected in the first round of the 2005 MLS Supplemental Draft and made seven appearances with D.C.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Convergence of measures\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, more specifically measure theory, there are various notions of the convergence of measures. For an intuitive general sense of what is meant by convergence in measure, consider a sequence of measures \u03bcn on a space, sharing a common collection of measurable sets. Such a sequence might represent an attempt to construct 'better and better' approximations to a desired measure \u03bc that is difficult to obtain directly. The meaning of 'better and better' is subject to all the usual caveats for taking limits; for any error tolerance \u03b5 > 0 we require there be N sufficiently large for n \u2265 N to ensure the 'difference' between \u03bcn and \u03bc is smaller than \u03b5. Various notions of convergence specify precisely what the word 'difference' should mean in that description; these notions are not equivalent to one another, and vary in strength.\n\nThree of the most common notions of convergence are described below.\n\nInformal descriptions\nThis section attempts to provide a rough intuitive description of three notions of convergence, using terminology developed in calculus courses; this section is necessarily imprecise as well as inexact, and the reader should refer to the formal clarifications in subsequent sections. In particular, the descriptions here do not address the possibility that the measure of some sets could be infinite, or that the underlying space could exhibit pathological behavior, and additional technical assumptions are needed for some of the statements. The statements in this section are however all correct if  is a sequence of probability measures on a Polish space.\n\nThe various notions of convergence formalize the assertion that the 'average value' of each 'sufficiently nice' function should converge:\n\nTo formalize this requires a careful specification of the set of functions under consideration and how uniform the convergence should be.\n\nThe notion of weak convergence requires this convergence to take place for every continuous bounded function . \nThis notion treats convergence for different functions f independently of one another, i.e., different functions f may require different values of N\u00a0\u2264\u00a0n to be approximated equally well (thus, convergence is non-uniform in ).\n\nThe notion of setwise convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of each measurable set should converge:\n\nAgain, no uniformity over the set  is required.\nIntuitively, considering integrals of 'nice' functions, this notion provides more uniformity than weak convergence. As a matter of fact, when considering sequences of measures with uniformly bounded\nvariation on a Polish space, setwise convergence implies the convergence   for any bounded measurable function .\nAs before, this convergence is non-uniform in \n\nThe notion of total variation convergence formalizes the assertion that the measure of all measurable sets should converge uniformly, i.e. for every  there exists N such that  for every n > N and for every measurable set . As before, this implies convergence of integrals against bounded measurable functions, but this time convergence is uniform over all functions bounded by any fixed constant.\n\nTotal variation convergence of measures\nThis is the strongest notion of convergence shown on this page and is defined as follows. Let  be a measurable space. The total variation distance between two (positive) measures \u03bc and \u03bd is then given by\n\nHere the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of all measurable functions from X to [\u22121,\u00a01]. This is in contrast, for example, to the Wasserstein metric, where the definition is of the same form, but the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of measurable functions from X to [\u22121,\u00a01] which have Lipschitz constant at most\u00a01; and also in contrast to the Radon metric, where the supremum is taken over f ranging over the set of continuous functions from X to [\u22121,\u00a01]. In the case where X is a Polish space, the total variation metric coincides with the Radon metric.\n\nIf \u03bc and \u03bd are both probability measures, then the total variation distance is also given by\n\nThe equivalence between these two definitions can be seen as a particular case of the Monge-Kantorovich duality.  From the two definitions above, it is clear that the total variation distance between probability measures is always between 0 and 2.\n\nTo illustrate the meaning of the total variation distance, consider the following thought experiment. Assume that we are given two probability measures \u03bc and \u03bd, as well as a random variable X. We know that X has law either \u03bc or \u03bd but we do not know which one of the two. Assume that these two measures have prior probabilities 0.5 each of being the true law of X. Assume now that we are given one single sample distributed according to the law of X and that we are then asked to guess which one of the two distributions describes that law. The quantity\n\nthen provides a sharp upper bound on the prior probability that our guess will be correct.\n\nGiven the above definition of total variation distance, a sequence \u03bcn of measures defined on the same measure space is said to converge to a measure \u03bc in total variation distance if for every \u03b5\u00a0>\u00a00, there exists an N such that for all n\u00a0>\u00a0N, one has that\n\nSetwise convergence of measures\nFor  a measurable space, a sequence \u03bcn is said to converge setwise to a limit \u03bc if\n\nfor every set .\n\nFor example, as a consequence of the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma, the sequence \u03bcn of measures on the interval [\u22121, 1] given by \u03bcn(dx) = (1+ sin(nx))dx converges setwise to Lebesgue measure, but it does not converge in total variation.\n\nWeak convergence of measures \nIn mathematics and statistics, weak convergence is one of many types of convergence relating to the convergence of measures. It depends on a topology on the underlying space and thus is not a purely measure theoretic notion.\n\nThere are several equivalent definitions of weak convergence of a sequence of measures, some of which are (apparently) more general than others. The equivalence of these conditions is sometimes known as the Portmanteau theorem.\n\nDefinition. Let  be a metric space with its Borel -algebra . A bounded sequence of positive probability measures  on  is said to converge weakly to the finite positive measure  (denoted ) if any of the following equivalent conditions is true (here  denotes expectation or the  norm with respect to , while  denotes expectation or the  norm with respect to ):\n\n  for all bounded, continuous functions ;\n  for all bounded and Lipschitz functions ;\n  for every upper semi-continuous function  bounded from above;\n  for every lower semi-continuous function  bounded from below;\n  for all closed sets  of space ;\n  for all open sets  of space ;\n  for all continuity sets  of measure .\n\nIn the case  with its usual topology, if  and  denote the cumulative distribution functions of the measures  and , respectively, then  converges weakly to  if and only if  for all points  at which  is continuous.\n\nFor example, the sequence where  is the Dirac measure located at  converges weakly to the Dirac measure located at 0 (if we view these as measures on  with the usual topology), but it does not converge setwise. This is intuitively clear: we only know that  is \"close\" to  because of the topology of .\n\nThis definition of weak convergence can be extended for  any metrizable topological space. It also defines a weak topology on , the set of all probability measures defined on .  The weak topology is generated by the following basis of open sets:\n\nwhere\n\nIf  is also separable, then  is metrizable and separable, for example by the L\u00e9vy\u2013Prokhorov metric. If  is also compact or Polish, so is .\n\nIf  is separable, it naturally embeds into  as the (closed) set of Dirac measures, and its convex hull is dense.\n\nThere are many \"arrow notations\" for this kind of convergence: the most frequently used are ,  and .\n\nWeak convergence of random variables\n\nLet  be a probability space and X be a metric space. If  is a sequence of random variables then Xn is said to converge weakly (or in distribution or in law) to X as  if the sequence of pushforward measures (Xn)\u2217(P) converges weakly to X\u2217(P) in the sense of weak convergence of measures on X, as defined above.\n\nSee also\n Convergence of random variables\n Prokhorov's theorem\n L\u00e9vy\u2013Prokhorov metric\n Tightness of measures\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n\nMeasure theory\nMeasure, Convergence of", "machine_text": " Convergence of measures In probability theory and analysis, the convergence of measures is a property that is closely related to the convergence of random variables and probability distributions. A measure is a function that assigns a value to every subset of a set. A measure is called convergent if, as the index approaches infinity, the measure of the union of a sequence of sets approaches the measure of their intersection. More precisely, let (\u03a9, \u03bc, \u221e) be a measure space, where \u03a9 is the set of all possible outcomes, \u03bc is the associated measure, and \u221e is the infinite index.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Division of Korea\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The division of Korea began with the defeat of Japan in World War II.  During the war, the Allied leaders considered the question of Korea's future after Japan's surrender in the war.  The leaders reached an understanding that Korea would be liberated from Japan but would be placed under an international trusteeship until the Koreans would be deemed ready for self-rule.\n\nIn the last days of the war, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones (a U.S. and Soviet one) with the 38th parallel as the dividing line. The Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.\n\nIt was understood that this division was only a temporary arrangement until the trusteeship could be implemented. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in December 1945 resulted in an agreement on a four-power Korean trusteeship lasting up to five years. However, with the onset of the Cold War and other factors both international and domestic, including Korean opposition to the trusteeship, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union over the next two years regarding the implementation of the trusteeship failed, thus effectively nullifying the only agreed-upon framework for the re-establishment of an independent and unified Korean state.\n\nWith this, the Korean question was referred to the United Nations.  In 1948, after the UN failed to produce an outcome acceptable to the Soviet Union, UN-supervised elections were held in the US-occupied south only. The American-backed Syngman Rhee won the election, while Kim Il-sung consolidated his position as the leader of Soviet-occupied northern Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea on 15 August 1948, promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea on 9 September 1948. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula.\n\nIn 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, North Korea invaded South Korea in an attempt to re-unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The subsequent Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and has left Korea divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) up to the present day.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, during the 2018 Inter-Korean Summit, the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted between the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un and the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in. Later that same year, following the September Inter-Korean Summit, several actions were taken toward reunification along the border, such as the dismantling of guard posts and the creation of buffer zones to prevent clashes.  On 12 December 2018, soldiers from both Koreas crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into the opposition countries for the first time in history.\n\nHistorical background\n\nJapanese rule (1910\u20131945)\n\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal protectorate of Japan, and was annexed by Japan in 1910. The Korean Emperor Gojong was removed. In the following decades, nationalist and radical groups emerged to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to come together in one national movement. The Korean Provisional Government in exile in China failed to obtain widespread recognition.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAt the Cairo Conference in November 1943, in the middle of World War Two, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force. At the end of the conference, the three powers declared that they were, \"mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.\" Roosevelt floated the idea of a trusteeship over Korea, but did not obtain agreement from the other powers. Roosevelt raised the idea with Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945. Stalin did not disagree, but advocated that the period of trusteeship be short.\n\nAt the Tehran and Yalta Conferences, Stalin promised to join his allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe. On 8 August 1945, two days after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, but before the second bomb was dropped at Nagasaki, the USSR declared war on Japan. As war began, the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East, Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky, called on Koreans to rise up against Japan, saying \"a banner of liberty and independence is rising in Seoul\".\n\nSoviet troops advanced rapidly, and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On 10 August 1945 two young officers \u2013 Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel \u2013 were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel as the dividing line. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he \"almost surely\" would have chosen a different line. The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone. Rusk observed, \"even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement\u00a0... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops\". He noted that he was \"faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area\". To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division. The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.\n\nSoviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by 14 August and rapidly took over the north-east of the country, and on 16 August they landed at Wonsan. On 24 August, the Red Army reached Pyongyang, the third largest city in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nGeneral Nobuyuki Abe, the last Japanese Governor-General of Korea, had established contact with a number of influential Koreans since the beginning of August 1945 to prepare the hand-over of power. Throughout August, Koreans organized people's committee branches for the \"\" (CPKI), led by Lyuh Woon-hyung, a left-wing politician. On 6 September 1945, a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short-lived People's Republic of Korea. In the spirit of consensus, conservative elder statesman Syngman Rhee, who was living in exile in the US, was nominated as president.\n\nPost\u2013World War II\n\nDivision (since 2 September 1945)\n\nSoviet occupation of northern Korea\n\nWhen Soviet troops entered Pyongyang, they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist Cho Man-sik. The Soviet Army allowed these \"People's Committees\" (which were friendly to the Soviet Union) to function. In September 1945, the Soviet administration issued its own currency, the \"Red Army won\". In 1946, Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov took charge of the administration and began to lobby the Soviet government for funds to support the ailing economy.\n\nIn February 1946 a provisional government called the Provisional People's Committee was formed under Kim Il-sung, who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in Manchuria. Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants manoeuvred to gain positions of power in the new government. In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land-reform program: land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers. Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural labourers under the people's committees, a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes. Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land, thereby making for a far more equal distribution of land. The North Korean land reform was achieved in a less violent way than in China or in Vietnam. Official American sources stated: \"From all accounts, the former village leaders were eliminated as a political force without resort to bloodshed, but extreme care was taken to preclude their return to power.\" The farmers responded positively; many collaborators, former landowners and Christians fled to the south, where some of them obtained positions in the new South Korean government. According to the U.S. military government, 400,000 northern Koreans went south as refugees.\n\nKey industries were nationalized. The economic situation was nearly as difficult in the north as it was in the south, as the Japanese had concentrated agriculture and service industries in the south and heavy industry in the north.\n\nSoviet forces departed in 1948.\n\nUS occupation of southern Korea\n\nWith the American government fearing Soviet expansion, and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum, the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times. On 7 September 1945, General Douglas MacArthur announced that Lieutenant General John R. Hodge was to administer Korean affairs, and Hodge landed in Incheon with his troops the next day.\nMacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ended up being in charge of southern Korea from 1945 to 1948 due to the lack of clear orders or initiative from Washington, D.C. There was no plan or guideline given to MacArthur from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State Department on how to rule Korea. Hodge directly reported to MacArthur and GHQ (General Headquarters) in Tokyo, not to Washington, D.C., during the military occupation. The three year period of the U.S. Army occupation was chaotic and tumultuous compared to the very peaceful and stable U.S. occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952. Hodge and his XXIV Corps were trained for combat, not for diplomacy and negotiating with the many diverse political groups that emerged in post-colonial southern Korea: former Japanese collaborators, pro-Soviet communists, anti-Soviet communists, right wing groups, and Korean nationalists. None of the Americans in the military or the State Department in the Far East in late 1945 even spoke Korean, leading to local Koreans joking about how Korean translators were really running southern Korea. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them. Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People's Republic of Korea and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.\n\nJapanese civilians were repatriated, including nearly all industrial managers and technicians; over 500,000 by December 1945 and 786,000 by August 1946.  Severe price inflation occurred in the disrupted economy, until in summer 1946 rationing and price controls were imposed.\n\nIn September 1946, thousands of laborers and peasants rose up against the military government. This uprising was quickly defeated, and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly. The opening of the Assembly was delayed to December to investigate widespread allegations of electoral fraud.\n\nArdent anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US, became the most prominent politician in the South. Rhee pressured the American government to abandon negotiations for a trusteeship and create an independent Republic of Korea in the south. On 19 July 1947, Lyuh Woon-hyung, the last senior politician committed to left-right dialogue, was assassinated by a 19-year-old man named Han Chigeun, a recent refugee from North Korea and an active member of a nationalist right-wing group.\n\nThe occupation government and then the newly formed South Korean government conducted a number of military campaigns against left-wing insurgents. Over the course of the next few years, between 30,000 and 100,000 people were killed. Most casualties resulted from the Jeju Uprising.\n\nUS\u2013Soviet Joint Commission\nIn December 1945, at the Moscow Conference, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union, the US, the Republic of China, and Britain would take part in a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. Many Koreans demanded independence immediately; however, the Korean Communist Party, which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party, supported the trusteeship. According to journalist Fyodor Tertitskiy, documentation from 1945 suggests the Soviet government had no plans for a permanent division.\n\nA  met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration, but failed to make progress due to increasing Cold War antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship. In 1946, the Soviet Union proposed Lyuh Woon-hyung as the leader of a unified Korea, but this was rejected by the US. Meanwhile, the division between the two zones deepened. The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics, and a transfer of population between North and South. In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit. At the final meeting of the Joint Commission in September 1947, Soviet delegate Terentii Shtykov proposed that both Soviet and US troops withdraw and give the Korean people the opportunity to form their own government. This was rejected by the US.\n\nUN intervention and the formation of separate governments\n\nWith the failure of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US brought the problem before the United Nations in September 1947. The Soviet Union opposed UN involvement. The UN passed a resolution on 14 November 1947, declaring that free elections should be held, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and a UN commission for Korea, the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK), should be created. The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections. In the absence of Soviet co-operation, it was decided to hold UN-supervised elections in the south only. This was in defiance of the report of the chairman of the commission, K. P. S. Menon, who had argued against a separate election. Some UNTCOK delegates felt that the conditions in the south gave unfair advantage to right-wing candidates, but they were overruled.\n\nThe decision to proceed with separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly saw it as a prelude to a permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948. In April, Jeju islanders rose up against the looming division of the country. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. Tens of thousands of islanders were killed and by one estimate, 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops. The uprising flared up again with the outbreak of the Korean War.\n\nIn April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in Pyongyang. The southern politicians Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties. The conference called for a united government and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Syngman Rhee and General Hodge denounced the conference. Kim Koo was assassinated the following year.\n\nOn 10 May 1948 the south held a general election. It took place amid widespread violence and intimidation, as well as a boycott by opponents of Syngman Rhee. On 15 August, the \"Republic of Korea\" (Daehan Minguk) formally took over power from the U.S. military, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. In the North, the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (Chos\u014fn Minjuju\u016di Inmin Konghwaguk) was declared on 9 September, with Kim Il-sung as prime minister.\n\nOn 12 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the report of UNTCOK and declared the Republic of Korea to be the \"only lawful government in Korea\". However, none of the members of UNTCOK considered that the election had established a legitimate national parliament. The Australian government, which had a representative on the commission declared that it was \"far from satisfied\" with the election.\n\nUnrest continued in the South. In October 1948, the Yeosu\u2013Suncheon rebellion took place, in which some regiments rejected the suppression of the Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government. In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the Bodo League in order to keep an eye on its political opponents. The majority of the Bodo League's members were innocent farmers and civilians who were forced into membership. The registered members or their families were executed at the beginning of the Korean War. On 24 December 1949, South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers or their family and affixed blame to communists.\n\nKorean War\n\nThis division of Korea, after more than a millennium of being unified, was seen as controversial and temporary by both regimes. From 1948 until the start of the civil war on 25 June 1950, the armed forces of each side engaged in a series of bloody conflicts along the border. In 1950, these conflicts escalated dramatically when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering the Korean War. The United Nations intervened to protect the South, sending a US-led force. As it occupied the south, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea attempted to unify Korea under its regime, initiating the nationalisation of industry, land reform, and the restoration of the People's Committees.\n\nWhile UN intervention was conceived as restoring the border at the 38th parallel, Syngman Rhee argued that the attack of the North had obliterated the boundary. Similarly UN Commander in Chief, General Douglas MacArthur stated that he intended to unify Korea, not just drive the North Korean forces back behind the border. However, the North overran 90% of the south until a counter-attack by US-led forces. As the North Korean forces were driven from the south, South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel on 1 October, and American and other UN forces followed a week later. This was despite warnings from the People's Republic of China that it would intervene if American troops crossed the parallel. As it occupied the north, the Republic of Korea, in turn, attempted to unify the country under its regime, with the Korean National Police enforcing political indoctrination. As US-led forces pushed into the north, China unleashed a counter-attack which drove them back into the south.\n\nIn 1951, the front line stabilized near the 38th parallel, and both sides began to consider an armistice. Rhee, however, demanded the war continue until Korea was unified under his leadership. The Communist side supported an armistice line being based on the 38th parallel, but the United Nations supported a line based on the territory held by each side, which was militarily defensible. The UN position, formulated by the Americans, went against the consensus leading up to the negotiations. Initially, the Americans proposed a line that passed through Pyongyang, far to the north of the front line. The Chinese and North Koreans eventually agreed to a border on the military line of contact rather than the 38th parallel, but this disagreement led to a tortuous and drawn-out negotiating process.\n\nArmistice\n\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement was signed after three years of war. The two sides agreed to create a  buffer zone between the states, known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This new border, reflecting the territory held by each side at the end of the war, crossed the 38th parallel diagonally. Rhee refused to accept the armistice and continued to urge the reunification of the country by force. Despite attempts by both sides to reunify the country, the war perpetuated the division of Korea and led to a permanent alliance between South Korea and the U.S., and a permanent U.S. garrison in the South.\n\nAs dictated by the terms of the Korean Armistice, a Geneva Conference was held in 1954 on the Korean question. Despite efforts by many of the nations involved, the conference ended without a declaration for a unified Korea.\n\nThe Armistice established a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) which was tasked to monitor the Armistice. Since 1953, members of the Swiss and Swedish armed forces have been members of the NNSC stationed near the DMZ.  Poland and Czechoslovakia were the neutral nations chosen by North Korea, but North Korea expelled their observers after those countries embraced capitalism.\n\nPost-armistice relations\n\nSince the war, Korea has remained divided along the DMZ. North and South have remained in a state of conflict, with the opposing regimes both claiming to be the legitimate government of the whole country. Sporadic negotiations have failed to produce lasting progress towards reunification.\n\nOn 27 April 2018 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Panmunjom Declaration signed by both leaders called for the end of longstanding military activities near the border and the reunification of Korea.\n\nOn 1 November 2018, buffer zones were established across the DMZ to help ensure the end of hostility on land, sea and air. The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea. In addition, no fly zones were established.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nPeriod dramas\nEyes of Dawn (1991-1992 MBC television series)\nRustic Period (2002-2003 SBS television series)\nSeoul 1945 (2006 KBS1 television series)\n\nSee also\n\n List of border incidents involving North and South Korea\n Korean conflict\n Korean reunification\n North Korea\u2013South Korea relations\n History of North Korea\n History of South Korea\n Partition of Vietnam\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Fields, David.

After failing to agree on a unified Korean government, the peninsula was divided into two separate states in 1948: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the north, and the Republic of Korea to the south. The boundary between the two states was the 38th parallel. The first of these two states to be established was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in September 1948. The Republic of Korea was established in August 1948. After the partition, many Koreans were separated from their families and friends, and many Koreans were killed as they crossed the 38th parallel. The border between the two states is still heavily fortified, and remains the focus of many reunification efforts. Both states claim to be the sole legitimate government of Korea. The United States supported the south, while the Soviet Union supported the north. Both superpowers agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea in the future, but the United States did not immediately withdraw its troops, in case the Soviet Union invaded the south. The Soviet Union also did not withdraw its troops, because it wanted to see a friendly, pro-Soviet regime in the south. In 1950, the two states became involved in the Korean War. The United States supported the south, while the Soviet Union supported the north. The war ended in a stalemate, and the border between the two states was left unchanged. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea, and the two states have been separate ever since.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 325746}

Some authors say that it comes from the word \"apostle\", which means \" messenger of the gospel\" in Greek. Others say that it comes from the word \"apostoles\", which means \" Application of the law\" in Latin. The first mention of the word Ap\u00f3stoles in relation to the present territory dates back to 1703. The town of Ap\u00f3stoles was founded on 3 October 1883, by Juan Cruz, who came from the province of San Juan with his wife Gregoria Cruz, and their children. The area was then part of the county (currutche) of J\u00e1chal. The foundation was authorized by the goverment of San Juan, which at that time was a province of the same name. The town was then located on the right bank of the J\u00e1chal River, near the present location of the town of J\u00e1chal. In 1886 the town was moved to its present location, due to the floods of the river. In 1840, during the wars against the indigenous people, the area of Ap\u00f3stoles was the scene of a battle between the forces led by General Juan Manuel de Rosas, who won, and the forces of the Indians, who were defeated. The Indians who survived the battle fled to the south, to the region of the pampas. According to the last census of the INDEC, performed in 2001, the municipality has a population of 21,010 inhabitants, of whom 11,451 live in the town of Ap\u00f3stoles, and 9,549 in the rural area.

The population density of the municipality is 20,72km2 (7.99sqmi). The density of the urban area is 4,560.00/km2 (1,731.72/sqmi), and the density of the rural area is 22,080.00/km2 (8,515.65/sqmi). The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture. The rural area is divided into large farms that dedicate themselves to the production of fruit, vegetables, and grains, and more recently also to viticulture. The main crops are wheat, barley, oats, peaches, nectarines, plums, and vines. Industry is almost non-existent, with the exception of some small factories dedicated to the processing of agricultural products.

In his preface Braithwaite describes himself as being in the service of the African Company, and as having, when very young, served in the fleet in Anne's reign, and then having been a lieutenant in the Welsh fusiliers, ensign in the Royal Guards, and secretary to his kinsman Christian Cole, the British resident at Venice, with whom he traveled through Europe. Braithwaite married Christian's niece Silvia, whose father was a merchant in Amsterdam.\n\nHe also states that he was in the Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent expeditions, and was present at the siege of Gibraltar (1727).

He has spent his career in the history department at American University in Washington, D.C. from which he retired as distinguished professor emeritus in 2015. He has written or co-authored twelve books and served for twenty-five years as editor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, a scholarly journal owned by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nEducation and career \nBreitman was born in 1947, in Connecticut. His grandparents had emigrated to the U.S. from Odessa and Krakow in 1905 and settled in Hartford, CT. His parents were American-born, his father, Saul, a businessman, his mother, Gloria (nee Salz) a homemaker. Breitman attended public schools in West Hartford, and he credits an inspiring high school history teacher, Robert Derosier, with bringing European history to life for him.\n\nBreitman graduated from Yale summa cum laude and earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. in modern European history at Harvard. His first book, German Socialism and Weimar Democracy (University of North Carolina Press, 1981), explored the tensions between socialist goals and democratic convictions in the Social Democratic Party of Germany during the Weimar Republic.\n\nNot long after, Breitman read an article by the famous historian Walter Laqueur that traced[js1]\u00a0 the story of an anonymous German industrialist who in 1942 brought to the West information about Hitler\u2019s planned use of gas chambers and crematoria to destroy European Jewry. This man\u2019s identity had remained a mystery for decades. Breitman, after months of archival research, proved that he was Eduard Schulte, a prominent but secret anti-Nazi CEO of a large mining firm who traveled frequently between Germany and Switzerland. Together, Breitman and Laqueur then wrote Schulte\u2019s story that detailed the muted reactions to his warnings: Breaking the Silence: the German Who Exposed the Final Solution (Simon & Schuster, 1986; University Press of new England, 1991). Translated into several languages, it remains in print.\n\nIn 1994, Breitman requested that the National Security Agency declassify its holdings of World War II intercepts and decodes of enemy radio messages. The NSA Historical Cryptographic Collection, amounting to some 1.3 million pages, was turned over to the U.S. National Archives. In this mass, Breitman found a small file of British decodes of German police radio messages that revealed important information about the first stage of the Holocaust. Prodded by Parliament, the British government followed with its own, larger, declassification of German police decodes. Breitman mined both archives for his 1998 book Official Secrets: What the Nazis Planned, What the British and Americans Knew (Hill & Wang). Still in print in a number of languages, it examines the relationships among German, British, and American policies toward European Jews.\n\nBreitman then served as director of historical research for a small U.S. government body set up to oversee implementation of a 1998 declassification law called the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. This organization helped to declassify more than eight million pages of U.S. government records, and a team of four historians used them to write U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis (Cambridge University Press, 2005).\n\nBreitman\u2019s best-known books are The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), which made the case for Heinrich Himmler\u2019s central planning of the Holocaust; and a work co-authored with Allan J. Lichtman, FDR and the Jews (Belknap-Harvard, 2013). In the latter, Breitman and Lichtman argued that Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s policies toward European Jewry fluctuated substantially over time according to circumstances and political calculations and constraints, but that his record nonetheless compared well with that of Winston Churchill, and also with later presidents when they were confronted with genocide abroad. Both books won prizes.\n\n\u00a0In 2019 Public Affairs published a book by Breitman about a previously overlooked mid-level American consul and diplomat based in Berlin from 1930 to 1939, Raymond Geist. Despite his modest rank, Geist was superb at dealing with Nazi officials and for urging greater use of the U.S. immigration quota for Germany to help Jews escape from Nazi persecution. Geist personally provided a visa to Albert Einstein (and his wife) and helped extract Sigmund Freud from Vienna. In December 1938 Geist, who had a secret source high in the Gestapo, predicted the coming Holocaust. That he was secretly gay made Geist\u2019s career and his achievements all the more remarkable.\n\nIn 1999 Breitman received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College, and in 2018 he was given a Distinguished Achievement Award from the Holocaust Educational Foundation.\n\nHe and his wife, Carol Rose (nee Wax), live in the Washington, DC area where he continues to write.\n\nPublications \n\nGerman Socialism and Weimar Democracy, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981\nWalter Laqueur and Richard Breitman, Breaking the Silence, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986.\nRichard Breitman and Alan Kraut, American Refugee Policy and European Jewry, 1933-1945, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987.\nThe Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution, New York: Alfred A.

Mendenhall in 1971.\n\nDescription \nThe ostracon displays a series of incisions in the pottery that have been suggested to be an early type of Bronze Age writing. The text has been compared to Byblian pseudo-hieroglyphic, but also Minoan Linear A and Linear B, Anatolian, Canaanite and various other old languages. It is regarded as a rare trace of early written communication and important for further academic investigation. The pottery sherd shows a badly defined row of symbols in what some consider to be an abstract linear rather than pictographic form of character. It has not been reliably dated however suggestions have been made of  or earlier. It has a double rope moulding that is similar to other Middle Bronze Age pottery from the Euphrates valley area of Syria. Dr. Cherie J. Lenzen has also suggested similar features were noted on pottery found at Tell Irbid in northern Jordan. Despite calls for dismissal or denial of the sherd as a \"by-form\" of the alphabet by Frank M. Cross, Mendenhall has said that the sherd \"clearly exhibits both the d\u00e2l and the th\u00e2 of later Eastern alphabets\".

These sherds are distinctive for their similarity to the parenting vessels of the Palouse region, as well as for their shell-impressed decoration, which is unique to this type. McClelland sherds are bowl-shaped and have a round base. The body is a fine-grained, creamy white ceramic, and the surface is typically smooth. The decoration is applied to the exterior of the vessel, near the rim. In each case, the decoration consists of a row of impressed, spiral-shaped shells, which are thought to have been made with a seashell or a tusk. The number of shells in each row varies, but is typically between five and eight. The sherds are thought to have been made by the ancestors of the present-day Confederated Tribes of the Palouse, who lived in the region for thousands of years. The vessels are similar to those made by the Palouse people, and are thought to have been made for the same purpose, which was probably the cooking of food. The impressed shells are thought to have been a form of decoration, and may have been used to identify the owner of the vessel.

It begins near La Mesa Dam as the San Francisco del Monte River, which officially takes the name San Juan River when it meets with Mariblo Creek in Quezon City. As the San Juan River, it passes through Quezon City, San Juan, the Manila district of Santa Mesa and Santa Ana, and Mandaluyong.\n\nRight-of-way issues caused the realignment of the Santa Mesa portion of the Skyway Stage 3. Instead of passing through Old Santa Mesa Street, the expressway now follows the course of the San Juan River from Araneta Avenue to Pasig River.\n\nTributaries\nAside from the San Francisco del Monte River, the San Juan River has five creeks as its main tributaries (starting from its mouth going upstream):\n\n Buhangin Creek in Mandaluyong is the tributary nearest to the river's confluence with the Pasig. Its mouth is in Barangay Poblaci\u00f3n, Mandaluyong, near the end of Bonifacio Avenue where it meets New Panaderos Street. Its traceable headwaters are somewhere in Barangay Zu\u00f1iga.\n Maytunas Creek in San Juan has its mouth near Sevilla Bridge at the end of Shaw Boulevard, Barangay Daang Bakal.

It joins the San Juan River in Barangay Kalusugan near E. Rodriguez Avenue behind St Luke's Medical Center. Its traceable headwaters are in Quezon City. The southernmost branch can be traced to Barangay Santolan near Blue Ridge Subdivision, the northernmost in Brgy. Pans\u00f3l near the UP Integrated School. An intermediate branch springs from within the Ateneo de Manila University campus, while a fourth branch, known as Victoria Creek, passes by the Anonas Avenue area and is notable for defining the boundary of Project 2 and 3, before finally ending in Barangay Duyan Duyan in Project 3.\n Mariblo Creek (sometimes called Talayan Creek and Tanque Creek; also spelt Mariablo) in Quezon City is the fifth main tributary. Mariblo Creek joins the San Franc\u00edsco River to form the San Juan River in Barangay Mariblo, near Quezon Avenue. Its traceable headwaters are in Barangay Bungad near the corner of West Avenue and EDSA; at the opposite end of West Avenue, near the Welcome Rotonda roundabout where West Avenue meets Quezon and Timog avenues; and in the Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center.\n\nAs the San Francisco del Monte River \nUpstream from the confluence with the Mariblo, the river is known as the San Francisco del Monte River.

The San Juan River originates in the city of San Juan, in the east-central part of the Philippines, where it is formed by the junction of the Balete and Kaligayan Rivers. It flows in a southwesterly direction and passes through the city of Mandaluyong. It then flows westwards through the city of San Juan and Makati before finally emptying into the Pasig River. The river is crossed by the Dr. Sixto K. Duerme Bridge connecting the cities of San Juan and Mandaluyong, the Barangka Flyover in Mandaluyong, and the Metro Manila Skyway in Makati. The San Juan River, like the other tributaries of the Pasig River, is heavily polluted due to industrial and domestic waste being dumped into the river. There have been efforts by the local government to clean up the river, but these have been hampered by the lack of funds and support from the national government. The river is a popular spot for fishing and boating, although the pollution in the river makes these activities potentially dangerous.

It is located in a provincial nature reserve, the Riserva Naturale orientata Cavagrande del Cassibile, about 1.5 kilometers (0.93 mi) south of the town of Gela. The site consists of a large artificial cave, with a roughly rectangular shape, measuring 60 by 40 meters (200 by 130 ft), with a height of 3 to 4 meters (9.5 to 13.1 ft). The entrance is 4 meters (13.1 ft) high and 2 meters (6.5 ft) wide. The interior is divided into two large rooms and a corridor that connects them. The cave has been dated to the early Bronze Age, with the pottery sherds found on the floor of the cave dated to between 2500 and 1600 BC. The cave was formed by digging into the calcareous rock, using stone tools. The same rock was then used to build the interior walls, which were smoothed and plastered. The floor was covered with a pinkish mortar. The finds from the cave include stone tools, pottery, and a bronze dagger. The items date from the early Bronze Age through the early Iron Age. The cave may have been used as a shelter, as a place to live, to hold meetings, or to perform religious rituals. The bronze dagger may have been an offering to the gods. The site was abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age, and never reused. In 2022, the site was declared a monument of cultural interest by the Sicilian regional government.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27357601}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"She Knows Me Too Well\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"She Knows Me Too Well\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love for the American rock band The Beach Boys, about a man who is engrossed and obsessed in his own jealousy and insecurity. It was released on the 1965 album The Beach Boys Today!, initially serving as the B-side of their \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\" single in 1964.  It was one of the first songs that Brian wrote while under the influence of marijuana.\n\nComposition\nBrian considered the song a tribute to Burt Bacharach. According to Allmusic, \"This song can essentially be called 'son of \"Don't Worry Baby\".' It's built around the same kinds of Spector-inspired chord changes and also has a similar sense of vulnerability.\" According to PopMatters,\n\nInterpreting its lyrics,\n\nDavid Leaf believed the song \"is another of the important musical developments on the road to Pet Sounds, and in retrospect, hearing this in 1965 might have felt very strange \u2026 almost like you were hearing a cut from Pet Sounds a year before that album even existed.\" He also notes that it was \"a gorgeous production, but it took a little while to get used to, probably because the bittersweet chord changes and harmonies were more sophisticated than the typical pop ballad of the day.\"\n\nRecording\nThe song was recorded over two sessions at United Western Recorders in early August, both engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson: the first session for the instrumental track took place on August 5 in tandem with \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\"; three days later, the vocals were recorded. They are doubletracked, just as they are on most Beach Boys songs. The instrumental track features Carl Wilson on both lead and rhythm electric guitars, Alan Jardine on electric bass guitar, Brian Wilson on acoustic upright piano, and Dennis Wilson on drums. The song features Brian Wilson on lead vocal and Brian, Carl & Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine on backing vocals.\n\nOn the Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 7 (1964): The Alternate \"Beach Boys Today\" Album Vol. 1 bootleg, various recording sessions were released in high quality. Four takes of the instrumental track (plus rehearsals) were released on this bootleg, as well as two backing vocal overdubs and Brian's lead vocal overdub.\n\nRelease\nIn August 1964, \"She Knows Me Too Well\" was released in the United States as the B-side of the \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\" single. The single, the band's tenth in the United States, peaked at number nine position on the Billboard charts, with \"She Knows Me Too Well\" in its own right placing at number 101 in Billboard and number 93 in Cash Box. The song was treated as the A-side at Vancouver's popular CFUN station and reached number seven locally.\n\nThe song was also released in the United Kingdom, again as the B-side of the \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\" single, which was the band's sixth there. The single didn't fare as well, but still peaked at number 27 on the charts.\n\nCash Box described it as \"a captivating cha cha beat romancer that's...sure to please the kids.\"\n\nAmerican rock band Stone Temple Pilots recorded a cover version of the song during the sessions for their 1994 album Purple. This version of the song was included on the band's 2019 \"Super Deluxe\" version of the album.\n\nPersonnel\nTrack details courtesy of session archivist Craig Slowinski.\n\nThe Beach Boys\nAl Jardine \u2013 electric bass guitar, harmony and background vocals\nMike Love \u2013 harmony and background vocals\nBrian Wilson \u2013 lead, harmony and background vocals; acoustic upright piano\nCarl Wilson \u2013  harmony and background vocals; electric lead and rhythm guitars\nDennis Wilson \u2013 harmony and background vocals; drums\n\nAdditional personnel\nChuck Britz \u2013 sound engineer\nRuss Titelman \u2013 microphone boom with screwdriver\n\nReferences\n\n1965 songs\nThe Beach Boys songs\nSongs written by Brian Wilson\nSongs written by Mike Love\nSong recordings produced by Brian Wilson\nCapitol Records singles", "machine_text": " \"She Knows Me Too Well\" is a song by American rock band the Eagles from their fifth studio album, One of These Nights (1976). The song was written by band members Glenn Frey and Joe Walsh, and produced by Frey and Eagles producer Bill Szymczyk. It is the third track on the album, and was the third single released from it, after \"Life in the Fast Lane\" and \"Doolin' Up\". \"She Knows Me Too Well\" is a piano-based ballad, and is one of the few Eagles songs that does not feature electric guitar. The song tells the story of a man who, after being dumped by his girlfriend, contemplates the reasons for their break-up. He concludes that, despite his efforts to be a good partner, his girlfriend knows him too well and can see through his attempts at being a good person. The song's meaning was influenced by Frey's crumbling marriage to his first wife, Juanita. Frey and Juanita had a difficult relationship, and their divorce was finalized in 1975, the year before One of These Nights was released. \"She Knows Me Too Well\" was the first Eagles song to feature backing vocals from singer and songwriter Linda Ronstadt, who also contributed to the song's arrangement. The song was included on the Eagles' compilation album Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975), and was one of the band's most popular songs during the 1970s.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4805512}

Holy Mass was celebrated by Pope Francis before political and religious leaders from around the world. The crowd was estimated between 150,000 and 200,000. Official delegations from 132 states and various religious groups attended. It was the first papal inauguration attended by the Patriarch of Constantinople in over 1,000 years.\n\nCeremony \n\nAbout half an hour before the Mass, Francis toured the square in the popemobile to greet the crowds. He stopped and left the popemobile once to kiss a disabled man.\nPope Francis wore a simple mitre, which he has had since he was bishop, as well as its matching chasuble. He used the pastoral staff that Benedict XVI used, but in contrast to Benedict XVI's grand liturgical sense, Pope Francis kept the songs and liturgical actions simple. According to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Pope Francis's lack of singing during Mass is attributed to him having only one lung.\n\nAfter the Pope's arrival, the ceremony began with the new Pope descending to the tomb of St. Peter in St. Peter's Basilica.  The pope, along with the Patriarchs and Major-Archbishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches prayed at the tomb. Afterwards, the pallium\u2014a lamb's wool shawl\u2014and the Ring of the Fisherman were taken by two deacons from the tomb where they had previously been laid and carried up to be borne in procession. Then the pope and the Eastern Catholic Patriarchs and Major-Archbishops went up to the Basilica main floor and proceeded along with the other cardinals, bishops and other clergy in procession to the square chanting the \"Laudes Regi\u00e6\".\n\nThe cardinal protodeacon, Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, bestowed the pallium on the Pope. The senior cardinal-priest present Godfried Danneels read the prayer for the new pope before the Ring of the Fisherman was presented.  Angelo Sodano, Dean of the College of Cardinals, presented him with his Fisherman's Ring of gold-plated silver unlike his predecessors' which were gold. Six cardinals, two of each rank of cardinal, then professed their obedience to Pope Francis on behalf of the College of Cardinals. In previous ceremonies, all the cardinals did so.\n\nAccording to a Vatican spokesperson between 150,000 and 200,000 people attended.\n\nHomily \nPope Francis delivered his homily in Italian. He focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated. He stated that everyone needs to care for the earth and for each other as Joseph cared for Jesus and Mary. He set forth a plan of his own actions: \"The pope, too, when exercising power, must enter ever more fully into that service, which has its radiant culmination on the cross.\"\n\nOfficial delegations \n\nSome 132 states and international organizations sent delegations to the inauguration. The delegations included 6 sovereign rulers, 31 heads of state, 3 princes, and 11 heads of government.\n\nStates\n\nTaiwan's representation was opposed by China, which has asked the Vatican to end the diplomatic relations with the state.\n\nOthers\n\nReligious figures\n\nChristian churches\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had not attended a papal inauguration since the Great Schism of 1054. Orthodox leaders said that the decision of Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople to attend showed that he considers the relationship between the Orthodox and Catholic churches a priority. They also noted that Francis' \"well-documented work for social justice and his insistence that globalization is detrimental to the poor\" may have created a \"renewed opportunity\" for the two church communities to \"work collectively on issues of mutual concern.\"\n\nOther religions\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Pope Francis inauguration: as it happened\n\nPope Francis\n2013 in Italy\n2013 in Christianity", "machine_text": " Papal inauguration of Pope Francis The papal inauguration of Francis took place on 13 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square. While previous papal inaugurations had been held in St. Peter's Square, the inauguration of Francis was the first to be held in the adjacent elliptical space, in front of the newly built Meta Sudio. The ceremony was attended by more than 150,000 people, who filled the square and the nearby streets. The number of attendees was surprising, given that the event was not well publicised. The Vatican had not arranged for the event to be shown live on television, and the local police had not expected such a large crowd. The ceremony began at 13:00 local time. In a break from tradition, Francis was not crowned with the tiara. After being presented with the pallium and the Ring of the Fisherman, he moved through the crowd to pray before the statue of Saint Peter, above which he had been elected. The ceremony ended with the singing of the \"Regina Caeli\". On the morning of 13 March 2013, Francis had breakfast with the cardinals who had elected him. He then received the congratulations of the diplomatic corps and was introduced to the office staff of the Holy See. In the afternoon, he met with the Curia, the dicasteries of the Roman Curia and the managers of the Vatican City State. In addition to the cardinals who had participated in the conclave, the inauguration was attended by more than 120 foreign delegations, including government officials from Argentina, Iraq, Japan, the United States and Venezuela, as well as from the European Union and the United Nations. The Israeli and Palestinian delegations were seated beside each other. The event was the first since the formation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870 that a pope had been installed in the Vatican City.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"West London Orbital\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The West London Orbital is a proposed extension to the London Overground railway system in London, UK. The extension would make use of a combination of existing freight and passenger lines including the Dudding Hill Line, North London Line and Hounslow Loop. The route would run for approximately 11 miles (17\u00a0km) from  and  at the northern end to  at the western end via , Neasden, Harlesden, , South Acton and .\n\nIf the extension were opened, it would improve rail connectivity across West and North-West London and establish a number of new connections to existing radial rail infrastructure including Thameslink, the Jubilee line, the Bakerloo line, High Speed 2, Crossrail and the Piccadilly line. It is anticipated the line would be operational by the mid-2020s, due to the fact that it makes use of existing underused rail infrastructure rather than requiring significant lengths of new track or tunnels to be built. The planned line would follow a portion of the route of the former Super Outer Circle that was operated by the Midland Railway from 1878 to 1880.\n\nThe scheme is supported by the Mayor and Transport for London's Transport Strategy; it is still at the proposal stage, although TfL published a business case for the plans in August 2019.\n\nDetail of the scheme\n\nThe West London Orbital line consists of a number of distinct sections: The Dudding Hill Line, the North London Line and the Hounslow Loop. The Dudding Hill line itself has had no scheduled passenger service for over a century. It has no stations, no electrification and a  speed limit with semaphore signalling, and is lightly used by freight and very occasional passenger charter trains. It is roughly  long.\n\nNear the site of  the West London Orbital would connect to the existing North London Line, and then further south at Acton, use the link down to the Hounslow Loop to reach  and . Taken together, this set of routes would be known as the \u201cWest London Orbital\u201d railway.\n\nIn March 2017 the West London Alliance group of local authorities commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of the line so that a decision could be taken as to whether it merited pursuing further. This study found that:\n\n The route is technically feasible.\n The scheme represents a high value for money, with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.2.\n Peak three-hour demand at 3,000 passengers southbound and 2,500 passengers northbound in 2031. This suggests that the level of passenger demand may be able to sustain a regular four-trains-per-hour or more service along the line. \n The line would enable significant new development to be undertaken along its length, supporting the creation of new homes and jobs.\n It would drastically improve orbital travel times around West London compared with the equivalent journey by car. For example, a journey from Barnet to Park Royal (enabling a change on to Crossrail or HS2 services) would take approximately  minutes. A trip from Acton to Cricklewood or Brent Cross would take approximately  minutes. A journey along the whole line from Barnet to Hounslow would take approximately 39 minutes (times the same for reverse journeys). \n Eight trains per hour in each direction would be achievable given existing traffic along the length of the route.\n It would connect town centres and regeneration areas, including the 45,000 new homes and 86,000 new jobs that will be created at Old Oak Common, Wembley and Brent Cross regeneration areas, putting a greater number of jobs and homes within easy reach of one another and supporting intensification in growth areas.\n It would remove a significant number of cars from the road, reducing congestion and improving journey times, particularly along the North Circular Road, as the population of London approaches 10 million over the next 20 years. \n It would allow passengers in outer London to access new services on Crossrail and HS2 via an interchange at .\n Potential to unlock significant amount of new housing.\n It would help to reduce passenger demand for central London stations such as King's Cross and  for orbital journeys that currently require travellers to go into central London before then travelling back out to reach their destination.\nIn June 2017 Transport for London published the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which stated that London government would work with the relevant boroughs to explore the feasibility of the proposed service, that would become the West London Orbital. In March 2018 the Mayor's Transport Strategy was published, which includes a proposal for this orbital connection to Old Oak between Hounslow and Brent Cross.\n\nCurrent position \n{\n  \"type\":

ratified by the London Assembly on 8 March 2018, includes plans for a West London Orbital railway line under Proposal 88. The mayor's proposal for the service highlights that utilising new and existing orbital connections in west London could also improve public transport connections in the city centre.\n\nThe West London Alliance group of local authorities have expressed support for the West London Orbital Scheme, and have confirmed that it will be incorporated in to all Local Plans. Discussions are currently underway between West London councils and London government on the future of the scheme.\n\nA number of independent analyses of the scheme have been published, including by Modern Railways magazine and the independent blogging community\n\nIn April 2019, \u00a3320\u00a0million of funding was approved for a new Brent Cross West railway station, that would also serve the potential new service.\n\nIn June 2019, Transport for London published the Strategic Outline Business Case for the scheme and concluded that there was a strong case for the scheme as it had a medium to high benefit-cost ratio. TfL found that for 8 trains per hour in the core the BCR was between 1.4 and 1.8 and for 4 trains per hour it would be 1.7 to 2.0. As the scheme was found to have a strong business case, TfL stated that it intended to proceed to the next stage which will look at how the scheme can be funded. A more detailed business case is expected to be developed in the next 18 months.\n\nEarlier proposals \nA number of routes have previously been examined for new orbital tube lines and improved connectivity across West and North London. It was considered that the most likely route of the previous proposal would be a north\u2013south route running from Brent Cross to Surbiton, via Wembley Park, Ealing Broadway, Richmond and Kingston fully underground, connecting several London Underground and National Rail lines, including the forthcoming Crossrail (Elizabeth Line) at Ealing Broadway.\n\nThe proposal envisaged an underground driverless light rail train system similar to the Docklands Light Railway, and updated \"to the most modern standards\". The transit time from Brent Cross to Surbiton was quoted as 28 minutes, with a maximum train speed of .\n\nThe promoters cited a number of reasons why they believed an underground scheme would be cost-effective at \u00a31.75\u00a0billion: with lower tunnelling costs as the tunnel diameter would be smaller than for a heavy rail scheme; there are no other rail tunnels to avoid (as in central London); and the subsoil strata are suitable for modern tunnel boring machines.\n\nAn unrelated scheme of the same name was previously proposed in June 2008 by the West London Business group. That proposal involved the construction of a new underground line across West and South West London and did not progress beyond concept stage.\n\nAdditionally, Regional Eurostar proposals meant to send trains from Eurostar lines into Waterloo International station to London Heathrow Airport used parts of the orbital between Willesden Junction and Acton.\n\nAlternative orbital schemes\nA number of other notable orbital rail schemes for London have been previously proposed:\nR25 railway orbital around the Zone 3 area of London. First proposed in the Mayor of London's \u00a31.3trn London Infrastructure 2050 plan, the line would use some existing National Rail and London Overground lines, linked by stretches of new railway.\n Orbirail was a 2012 proposal for an outer \"super loop\" service roughy equivalent to a M25 for rail. The West London Orbital proposal makes use of some elements of this concept. \n The Park Royal Partnership promoted a 'FastBus' scheme of branded, limited-stop buses, between  and  stations and possibly beyond. \n The 'North and West London Light Railway' (or the 'Brent Cross Railway') is a proposed rapid transit network. The scheme was originally developed by the London group of the Campaign for Better Transport, and mainly uses existing or abandoned surface railway corridors.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nProposed rail infrastructure in London\nProposed railway lines in London", "machine_text": " West London Orbital The West London Orbital is a road in west London, England, that is a western and southern orbital counterpart to the M60 motorway that encircles Manchester. The West London Orbital is not a single road but a collection of roads, bus lanes and canals that together encircle the western part of London. The orbital's northern section is formed by the A40, a major road that runs from Hyde Park Corner in the east to the M40 motorway at Denham in the west. The section of the A40 between Western Avenue and the M40 is known as the Western Avenue and the section between the M40 and Hyde Park Corner is called the Avenue of Approach. The western section of the orbital comprises the A4, a major road that runs from the A40 at Hammersmith to the A30 at Richmond. The A4 runs along the line of the historic Roman road, the Via Trinobantina, which linked London to Calleva Atrebatum, now Silchester, Hampshire. The southern section of the orbital is formed by the A3, a major road that runs from the A4 at Hammersmith to the M3 motorway at Raynes Park. The orbital's crossing points are at Willesden, Harlesden, Shepherd's Bush, and Putney. The West London Orbital is 16.2 miles (26.3 km) long and has a diameter of 3.3 miles (5.3 km). It has no official status as an orbital road, unlike the London Inner Orbital Road (A406) and the London Orbital Highway (M25). The roads that make up the West London Orbital have varying qualities. The A40 and the A4 are major roads and are all-purpose dual carriageways. The A3 is a major road and is a single carriageway. Where the A3 has 3 lanes, the middle lane is an advisory lane and is intended for use by buses and heavy goods vehicles.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 24241552}
