The size distribution of voids in the range\n5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving\nMpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without\nadditional hot bubbles.

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring.

The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\ndetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\nmantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than\na slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement\nwith observations.\n", "machine_text": "The gas-grain chemistry in cold interstellar cloud cores is a key issue in the formation of the first stars.

For this constraint to be as tight as\npossible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.\nThis can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux\ndipole is measured.

More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target\nprocess, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of\na bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this\nwork we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a\ncontinuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$,\nirrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of\nasymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating\nstationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330\nmature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements\nof MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow\nof around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between\nnegative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR\n8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These\nobservational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part\nof a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this\nmodel the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar\nsurface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km\ns$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair\ndecreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with\nincreasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the\nchange in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat\nflow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is\nalso in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that\nproperties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution\nstages of the parent sunspot.

We consider two types of dense matter\nmodels with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange\nN-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and\ndeconfinement of quarks.

As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops\nmuch faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile.\nNear the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift\ninto the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering\nrate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a\nhigher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the\nradiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons\nproduced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}\nnear the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of ~0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total\nscattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be\nhigher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^{2/3} than obtained without full\nradiative transfer.

As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines.

A novel approach of positron identification\nwith the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of\nbremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced.\nBremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with\nrespect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the\nbremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron\nmomenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the\nexperiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron\noverabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron\nproduction. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a\npositron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.\n  The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are\ncombined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron\nfraction data yet available.\n", "machine_text": "The LHC is a powerful tool for searching for dark matter, but it is not the only tool.

{"prompt": "A model for the Globular Cluster extreme anomalies", "human_text": "  In spite of the efforts made in the latest years, still there is no\ncomprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars.\nAmong these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down\nto [O/Fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]~ -\n1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of\ntwo different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain\nthe oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A\nFRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects,\nstarting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the\nmost extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to\nexplain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a\nfraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen\ndepleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from\ntheir main sequence multiplicity.

We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength.

The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in\nagreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a\nlight-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a\nperiodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a\nmore precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine\nwether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes\nhave to be considered preliminary estimates.

{"prompt": "Electrostatic Interactions of Asymmetrically Charged Membranes", "human_text": "  We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially\nscreened or long-range power law) of the electrostatic interactions of\noppositely charged and planar plates as a function of the salt concentration\nand surface charge densities (whose absolute magnitudes are not necessarily\nequal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and\nrepulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This\ncondition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the\ninteraction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and\nPincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and\nthe Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we\npredict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive\npressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure\nis related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate\ndistance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with\ndifferent scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and\nsurface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface\nforce experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating\none of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.\n", "machine_text": "The electrostatic interactions of asymmetrically charged membranes are studied.

{"prompt": "Trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates", "human_text": "  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.\n(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses\nundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n", "machine_text": "The trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates are presented.

In these analyses, we find tentative\nevidence of systematics: The foreground tracers correlate with each of the Q-\nand V-band sky maps individually, although not with the co-added QV map; there\nis a noticeable negative EB cross-correlation at l <~ 16 in the V-band map; and\nfinally, when relaxing the constraints on EB and BB, noticeable differences are\nobserved between the marginalized band powers in the Q- and V-bands.

We find that the correlations between the quasars and the polarized sky maps are weak.

Most of the detected line\ntransitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing a\ncomprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various line\nemissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass.
