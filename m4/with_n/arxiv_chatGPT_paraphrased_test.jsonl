For this constraint to be as tight as\npossible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.\nThis can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux\ndipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS\nsurvey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation\nof the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the\nnear-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot\nnoise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB\ndipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal\nvalue of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min\nto larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS\nflux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.\n  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of\ntheir correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation\nvalue of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal\ngravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the\nmisalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is\nconsistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the\nexpectation value).

This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for\nGRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular\nmomentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds\nmay inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss\nrecently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe\n2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the\nrecurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted\nmass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some\ncore-collapse SNe.\n", "machine_text": "In this study, we investigate the mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and the quasi-periodic modulations of radio supernovae (SNe). Large-scale mass loss is a defining characteristic of LBVs, which are evolved, massive, and hot stars. However, the mechanism behind such mass loss is yet to be clarified. Moreover, the recent detection of quasi-periodic modulations of radio emission from SNe poses a challenge in understanding the underlying physical process. Therefore, we aim to address these issues by analyzing multi-epoch radio data from a sample of LBVs and SNe using time-frequency analysis techniques.\n\nOur analysis demonstrates a complex and variable mass loss process among the LBV sample, indicating that different mechanisms could be involved. We find evidence of periodic oscillations in some of the radio SNe, which could be due to the interaction of SN ejecta with a circumstellar medium, implying that SNe may possess a distinct periodic modality. The findings from our study provide significant insights into the mass loss mechanisms from LBVs and the physical causes of the quasi-periodic modulations of SNe.\n\nThe motivation for our research lies in the crucial role that LBVs and SNe play in astrophysical processes, such as the synthesis of heavy elements and the formation of black holes.

Our study results demonstrate that the katrin instrument has a very high sensitivity to the neutrino mass, with a predicted uncertainty of 0.2 eV, which is the highest possible for other experimental experiments.

This approach is applicable to the study of the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics, in particular to the understanding of the complementary nature of wave- and particle-like behaviour of light.

This work was undertaken to examine the relationship between random matrix theory and information theory, and provided a new perspective on the relationship between the two theories. This study was conducted in the context of a large dataset, a computational work, where the main idea was to develop a central limit theorem to describe the properties of Gram random matrixes with a given variance. This result is based on the idea of a central limit theorem for information theory of Gram random matrixes, a matrix with a fixed variance. ", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv"}

The derived results confirm that no\nsingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns\nin DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing\nthe DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and\nquiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs\nhave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with\nhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star\nformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <\nlog SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a\nlarge spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our\nsample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it\nnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the\nDLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of\nobservation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at\nz>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with\nthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with\nthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.\n", "machine_text": "In this article, we present a comprehensive set of elemental abundances in Damped Lyman-\u03b1 systems (DLAs) to investigate their star formation histories.

Therefore, understanding the elemental abundances in DLAs can shed light on the chemical evolution of galaxies and how these systems have formed over time.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we have compiled a catalogue of DLAs detected in quasar spectra and analyzed their elemental abundances.

We develop a special homological Koszul complex on a smooth, infinite variety of jets, and derive from it a generalization of the Tsygan theorem, which shows the formality of the deformation quantization algebra in a smooth, algebraic variety. The first task of our research is to understand the relationship between deformation quantization and Koszul duality. The concept of a Lie algebra is used to create a bridge between deformation quantization and Koszul duality. This bridge is based on the fact that deformation quantization is not a Poisson-like deformation in the dual space. ", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv"}

Our goal is to infer statistical properties of the polarization field at large angular scales, taking into account uncertainties arising from instrumental noise and cosmic variance. Our approach relies on modeling the polarization field as a Gaussian random process, parameterized in terms of power spectra and correlation functions. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. We find that our results are consistent with the best-fit cosmological model favored by the analysis of the temperature anisotropy maps. In particular, we obtain constraints on the amplitude and shape of the polarization power spectra that are consistent with theoretical predictions based on the inflationary paradigm. We also investigate the level of non-Gaussianity in the polarization patterns, and find no evidence for significant deviations from Gaussianity.
