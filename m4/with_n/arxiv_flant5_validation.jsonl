Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability\nof 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the\nphysical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods.\nWe adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray\nlight curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and\ntime derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy\ndistribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy\ndistribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2.

In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling.

We find that the error in\nthe spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At\nworst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a\nnon-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. We\nalso consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in the\ndisk and that inside the ISCO.

Orbital free methods attempt to\ncalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the\nuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local\napproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise\ngenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic\npotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in\nthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two\nnonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for\nboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact\nresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to\nsmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate\nand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying\nvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free\nDF calculations of molecules and solids.

Comparing our fully three-dimensional\nsimulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the\nMZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium\nmetallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment\nbalance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the\ndilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to\nZ_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass\nM_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its\nhalo.

If the black hole mass is smaller than 50-100 Msun, gas accretion is\nunaffected by Compton drag. A point mass and an extended dark halo of equal\nmass accrete at the same rate if M>5000 Msun, while smaller mass dark halos\naccrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass. For masses M>3 x 10^4\nMsun, the viscous term due to the Hubble expansion becomes important and the\nassumption of quasi-steady flow fails.

Evidence of\nmultifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported\n[Ivanov et al., Nature {\\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character\ncould be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale\ninvariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart\nrate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In\nthis paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance\nreported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy\nheartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating\nthat the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent.\nOur work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of\nhuman heartbeat dynamics, which is shared by heart rate fluctuations in both\nhealthy and pathological states.\n", "machine_text": "The heartbeat is a complex dynamical system with a multifractal structure.

We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques.

In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family.

Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves).
