The study focuses on the most usual\ncase of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The\nnotion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined\nfor such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link\nseveral solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a\nsingularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An\nadditional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are\ncharacterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new\nuniqueness domains. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR\nplanar parallel manipulator. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the\njoint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets.\n", "machine_text": "In this work, we explore the notion of uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators.

We then apply this framework to a number of specific manipulator architectures, including the Stewart platform and the 3-PRRR robot.

Our main purpose is to improve the performance of tabling in languages that have tabs. We investigate linear strategies to reduce the time and memory burden of tabling, and to increase the accuracy of the computation. We study linear strategies to avoid unnecessary table calls and redundant suspends. We investigate linear strategies for reducing the number of calls to the table and preserving the correctness of computation. Our results show that our approach can significantly reduce the time and memory of tabling and increase the accuracy of the computation. ", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv"}

For parameters relevant to the\noligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical\neccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact\nparameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each\nother; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the\nprotoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise\nunperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less\nthan a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between\ntheir neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the\nshear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding\nzones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets\nin the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that\ndepends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma/\\sigma$.\nEarly in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between\nrows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10\nHill radii cited in the literature.

The only measurable deviation from\nthe power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of cold\nand ionized fluorescent iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV,\nrespectively. While constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the cold\nline is found to be narrow at CCD-resolution with a flux that does not track\nthe temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in the\nouter radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of Seyfert\nunification schemes.

The motivation for this research is the observation that different models of modified gravity exhibit distinct behavior in the linear regime of structure formation, potentially providing new insights into the nature of dark energy. \n\nWe employ a range of modified gravity models, including the f(R) and scalar-tensor theories. Our results show that modified gravity models can significantly affect the growth rate of matter density perturbations and the effective gravitational constant, leading to differences in the predicted large-scale structure. The predictions of our models are in good agreement with current observational constraints, suggesting that modified gravity models can provide a viable alternative to the standard dark energy paradigm. Overall, our study highlights the importance of exploring modified gravity models to gain deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the large-scale structure of the universe.", "paraphrased_abstract": "It was therefore necessary to investigate the effect of different gravity models on the structure of matter, and to determine if the predictions are in line with the predictions of the standard model.

Our model predicted the increase of density and the elastic force, and the results were in line with the observation. The result showed that the modified gravity models influenced the growth of the density of the particles and the elastic force, and thus significantly changed the resemblance of the universe.

In achieving this goal, it is essential to have a clear grasp of the physics and mechanics of tribological systems, of which low traction is a crucial factor. \n\nTo accomplish our objective, we conducted experiments on two identical rolling-sliding lubricated contact configurations using a ball-on-disk tribometer. The results obtained revealed that super low traction can occur in mixed lubricated conditions, contrary to traditional expectations of only occurring at full EHL. Additionally, we observed that the low traction in mixed lubrication is highly dependent on prevalent conditions of slip and micro-asperity interference. We also noted that there exists an optimal range of slip velocity that maximizes the super low traction, reducing as slip velocity deviates from this range. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study provides valuable insights into the mechanics of low traction and the role of mixed lubrication conditions in enhancing sliding efficiency.

The analysis is based on a data-driven approach that uses a new multivariate analysis that is optimized for this class of decays and guarantees robustness in the presence of experimental uncertainties. Besides, we have revealed a number of unexpected resonances, which are greatly increased by the increasing number of decay modes. Moreover, we have observed new patterns in the distribution of decay kinematics, and the angular correlations between decay products, showing that the correlations can be attributed to the difference in frequencies.

We applied this method to two hot Jupiter exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, for which previous measurements of their rotation rate have reported conflicting results. Our analysis showed that the transit spectra of both planets are consistent with a slow rotation rate, limiting it to less than 17% of their orbital period.

We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated.

CONCLUSIONS:\nWe find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs\nare elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most\nimportant reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical\ndilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical\nabsorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2).

In our study, we elucidate the origin of the hadronic gamma rays in supernovae and their corresponding gamma rays. In our study, we are analyzing the origin of the hadronic gamma rays in supernovae, and we conclude that they can be produced in the presence of hadronic gamma rays, but that their contribution to the gamma rays is rather small compared to other gamma rays. This is why we have made a numerical hydrodynamic model of the gamma rays, and have developed a comprehensive model of the gamma rays. Our study will help to verify our models, and will lead to more insights into the physics of the gamma rays. ", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "arxiv"}
