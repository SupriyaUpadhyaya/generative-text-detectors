Then, using individual fPCAs, one each for phase and amplitude\ncomponents, while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation\nspace; impose joint probability models on principal coefficients of these\ncomponents. These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling, for models\nestimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over\nmodels that ignore phase-amplitude separation. Furthermore, the generative\nmodels are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high\nperformance in applications involv- ing SONAR signals of underwater objects,\nhandwritten signatures, and periodic body movements recorded by smart phones.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel generative model for functional data that leverages phase and amplitude separation to capture complex patterns in functional data. Our approach addresses the challenge of modeling functional data with multiple oscillatory components, where traditional methods often fail to capture the intricate relationships between the components. By decomposing the functional data into phase and amplitude components, we develop a probabilistic framework that can effectively model and generate complex functional data with multiple oscillatory components. Our methodology combines a Gaussian process prior with a phase-amplitude separation mechanism, allowing us to capture the complex interactions between the components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of simulations and real-world applications, including EEG and fMRI data analysis. Our results show that our model can accurately capture the underlying patterns in functional data and generate realistic synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data.

We investigate the effectiveness of different fusion schemes, including weighted sum, decision-level fusion, and feature-level fusion, and compare their performance using a dataset of visual and thermal face images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving a recognition rate of 95.6% on the test dataset. We also conduct a comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate its robustness to variations in lighting conditions and facial expressions. Our findings highlight the potential of fusion-based approaches for improving human face recognition accuracy, particularly in scenarios where visual and thermal modalities are used in combination.    \n\n\n\n("}

The key idea is to formulate the classification problem as a probabilistic optimization problem, where the goal is to maximize the probability of correctly classifying instances. We employ a fuzzy membership function to incorporate expert knowledge and uncertainty into the classification process. The proposed method is shown to be computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale classification tasks. Our results highlight the potential of probabilistic FSVMs for real-world applications, where uncertainty and ambiguity are inherent. \n\n(Note: The generated abstract is strictly 246 words.)

Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such\nsystems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically\nby assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an\nappropriate manner, e.g. majority voting.\n  In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and\npose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task\nassignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give\na new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for\ninferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our\nalgorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation,\nsignificantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through\ncomparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we\ncompare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can\ndynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the\nnext arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We\nshow that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a\ntarget reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and\nnon-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under\nboth scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and\ncan not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that\nbuilding a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing\nthe potential of adaptive designs.", "machine_text": "We present a novel approach to budget-optimal task allocation for reliable crowdsourcing systems.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, showing that it achieves significant cost savings while maintaining high task reliability. Our results also highlight the importance of considering worker reliability in task allocation, as ignoring this factor can lead to significant decreases in system reliability. By incorporating worker reliability into the allocation process, we show that our approach can improve task completion rates by up to 25% compared to traditional methods.

Our research aimed to address the issue of limited accuracy in face recognition systems, particularly in scenarios involving low-quality images or varying lighting conditions. We evaluated the efficacy of five prominent face recognition techniques, including Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Local Quantization Patterns (LQP), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Our results indicate that the DNN-based approach outperformed the traditional techniques, achieving an average accuracy of 95.2% on a dataset comprising 1,000 images. Furthermore, we observed that the combination of LBP and LQP features improved the accuracy of the DNN-based approach to 97.5%. Our findings suggest that the integration of traditional face recognition techniques with neural networks can enhance the overall performance of face recognition systems, particularly in challenging scenarios.

FBST is a powerful Bayesian test for precise hypothesis, as\nan alternative to frequentist's significance tests (characterized by the\ncalculation of the \\emph{p-value}).", "machine_text": "We present a Bayesian test of significance for conditional independence in the context of the multinomial model. This test addresses the problem of identifying conditional dependencies between multiple variables in the presence of categorical outcomes. We develop a novel approach that leverages the Dirichlet process mixture model to capture the complex relationships between variables. Our method provides a principled way to quantify the strength of conditional dependencies and to determine the significance of these relationships. Through a comprehensive simulation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting conditional dependencies in various scenarios, including cases with high-dimensional data and complex relationships. Our results show that our Bayesian test of significance outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. We also apply our method to a real-world dataset, illustrating its potential for practical applications in fields such as medicine, social sciences, and economics. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to identify conditional dependencies in categorical data.     ( "}

A new field of interest based on\nsparsity has recently emerged: compressed sensing. This theory is a new\nsampling framework that provides an alternative to the well-known Shannon\nsampling theory. In this paper we investigate how compressed sensing (CS) can\nprovide new insights into astronomical data compression and more generally how\nit paves the way for new conceptions in astronomical remote sensing. We first\ngive a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very\nsimple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for\nreal-time applications often found on board space mission. We introduce a\npractical and effective recovery algorithm for decoding compressed data. In\nastronomy, physical prior information is often crucial for devising effective\nsignal processing methods. We particularly point out that a CS-based\ncompression scheme is flexible enough to account for such information. In this\ncontext, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and\ndata processing are merged. We show also that CS provides a new fantastic way\nto handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover\ninformation at very low signal-to-noise ratio, which is impossible with\nstandard compression methods. This CS data fusion concept could lead to an\nelegant and effective way to solve the problem ESA is faced with, for the\ntransmission to the earth of the data collected by PACS, one of the instruments\non board the Herschel spacecraft which will be launched in 2008.", "machine_text": "We present a novel application of compressed sensing in astronomy, tackling the problem of reconstructing sparse signals from undersampled data.

By listing many examples of submodular functions, we review\nvarious applications to machine learning, such as clustering, experimental\ndesign, sensor placement, graphical model structure learning or subset\nselection, as well as a family of structured sparsity-inducing norms that can\nbe derived and used from submodular functions.", "machine_text": "We investigate the problem of learning with submodular functions, a class of functions that exhibit diminishing returns, which is crucial in various applications such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and economics.

The\nwavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order\nwavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing\ntheory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction\nguarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the\nso-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how\ncorrelated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar\nwavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly,\nso for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square\npower-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with\nnear-optimal embedding dimensions.

Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed,\nstrong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to\nregularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP\nestimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter\nsettings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from\nnon-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems,\na number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian\n(VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading\nto better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function\nnow involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex,\nfunction-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard\nBayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism\nthese methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and\nextensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the\nVB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very\nparticular penalty/prior that couples the image, blur kernel, and noise level\nin a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics\npertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, and scale-invariance\nthat allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing\nimplementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict\ncriteria for choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps\ncounter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes. In so\ndoing we challenge the prevailing notion of why VB is successful for blind\ndeconvolution while providing a transparent platform for introducing\nenhancements.", "machine_text": "In this work, we revisit the problem of Bayesian blind deconvolution, addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling complex imaging scenarios. We propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both traditional and deep learning-based methods to achieve improved performance. Our approach is built upon a probabilistic framework that jointly models the deconvolution process and the underlying image statistics. We employ a hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates a Gaussian process prior to capture the complex spatial dependencies in the image. The deconvolution process is formulated as an inference problem, where we utilize a variational inference scheme to estimate the posterior distribution of the deconvolved image.

The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion\nchannels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a\ndifferential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there\nhave been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential\nequation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by\nMarkov chain models.

We show that the former\nchannel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its\neffect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously\ndemonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis\nprovides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the\ntemporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of\nbundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not\ncorrectly account for this structure.

This approach can increase ad efficacy for two\nmain reasons: peers' affiliations reflect unobserved consumer characteristics,\nwhich are correlated along the social network; and the inclusion of social cues\n(i.e., peers' association with a brand) alongside ads affect responses via\nsocial influence processes. For these reasons, responses may be increased when\nmultiple social signals are presented with ads, and when ads are affiliated\nwith peers who are strong, rather than weak, ties.\n  We conduct two very large field experiments that identify the effect of\nsocial cues on consumer responses to ads, measured in terms of ad clicks and\nthe formation of connections with the advertised entity. In the first\nexperiment, we randomize the number of social cues present in word-of-mouth\nadvertising, and measure how responses increase as a function of the number of\ncues. The second experiment examines the effect of augmenting traditional ad\nunits with a minimal social cue (i.e., displaying a peer's affiliation below an\nad in light grey text). On average, this cue causes significant increases in ad\nperformance. Using a measurement of tie strength based on the total amount of\ncommunication between subjects and their peers, we show that these influence\neffects are greatest for strong ties.

Furthermore, we discover that the type of social influence matters, with influencer endorsements being more effective than peer endorsements. Our results also suggest that the effectiveness of social influence on advertising is moderated by the level of product familiarity, with more familiar products being less susceptible to social influence.

This paper demonstrates\nhow the target diagnosis can be identified by performing a sequence of\nobservations, that is, by querying an oracle about entailments of the target\nontology. To identify the best query we propose two query selection strategies:\na simple \"split-in-half\" strategy and an entropy-based strategy. The latter\nallows knowledge about typical user errors to be exploited to minimize the\nnumber of queries. Our evaluation showed that the entropy-based method\nsignificantly reduces the number of required queries compared to the\n\"split-in-half\" approach. We experimented with different probability\ndistributions of user errors and different qualities of the a-priori\nprobabilities. Our measurements demonstrated the superiority of entropy-based\nquery selection even in cases where all fault probabilities are equal, i.e.\nwhere no information about typical user errors is available.", "machine_text": "We present an interactive ontology debugging framework that employs two query strategies for efficient fault localization. We address the challenge of ontology debugging, where the sheer size and complexity of ontologies hinder manual debugging efforts. Our framework enables users to interactively explore and debug ontologies by posing queries that identify faulty regions. We propose two query strategies: the \"Path-based\" approach, which exploits the structural relationships between concepts, and the \"Pattern-based\" approach, which targets specific patterns of errors. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, showcasing improved fault localization accuracy and reduced debugging time compared to traditional methods. Our framework provides a user-friendly interface for ontology debugging, enabling domain experts to efficiently identify and resolve errors in large-scale ontologies. By integrating the proposed query strategies with interactive debugging tools, we provide a powerful framework for ontology debugging, enabling researchers and practitioners to develop high-quality, reliable ontologies.

Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis\nmismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier\nrepresentation. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm, called\n\\emph{Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)}, based on structured matrix completion\nthat does not require prior knowledge of the model order. The algorithm starts\nby arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form exhibiting multi-fold\nHankel structure, and then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization.\nUnder mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the\nnumber of samples exceeds the order of $r\\log^{4}n$, and is stable against\nbounded noise. Even if a constant portion of samples are corrupted with\narbitrary magnitude, EMaC still allows exact recovery, provided that the sample\ncomplexity exceeds the order of $r^{2}\\log^{3}n$.

It is widely believed that the\nl1- norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the\nsuccess of SRC, while its use of all training samples to collaboratively\nrepresent the query sample is rather ignored. In this paper we discuss how SRC\nworks, and show that the collaborative representation mechanism used in SRC is\nmuch more crucial to its success of face classification. The SRC is a special\ncase of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which has\nvarious instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual and\ncoding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization of\ncoding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels,\nwhile the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding coefficient is related to\nthe degree of discrimination of facial features. Extensive experiments were\nconducted to verify the face recognition accuracy and efficiency of CRC with\ndifferent instantiations.", "machine_text": "We address the problem of face recognition by proposing a novel Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) approach. Our method leverages the strengths of both collaborative representation and deep neural networks to improve face recognition performance. In CRC, we represent each face as a combination of multiple collaboratively learned features from different face regions. These features are then used to train a classification model that can effectively distinguish between different individuals. Our experimental results demonstrate that CRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 97.5% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and 98.1% on the Extended Yale B dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CRC in handling occlusions and variations in lighting conditions. Our approach is robust and efficient, making it a promising solution for real-world face recognition applications. \n\n(Note: This is the abstract generated by the AI model.
