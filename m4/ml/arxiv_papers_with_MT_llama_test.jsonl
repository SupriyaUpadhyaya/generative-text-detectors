The next step is to apply the modified non-local\nmeans filtering to the noisy image using the reference patches obtained in the\nfirst step.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the\ncorrecting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or\nToffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single\nqubit, in 63 ns.

Facial gesture recognition is one of the important component\nof natural human-machine interfaces; it may also be used in behavioural\nscience, security systems and in clinical practice. Although humans recognise\nfacial expressions virtually without effort or delay, reliable expression\nrecognition by machine is still a challenge. The face expression recognition\nproblem is challenging because different individuals display the same\nexpression differently. This paper presents an overview of gesture recognition\nin real time using the concepts of correlation and Mahalanobis distance.We\nconsider the six universal emotional categories namely joy, anger, fear,\ndisgust, sadness and surprise.", "machine_text": "We propose a novel approach to facial gesture recognition, leveraging the correlation and Mahalanobis distance metrics to effectively distinguish between different facial expressions. Our methodology involves extracting relevant features from facial images using the correlation coefficient, which captures the spatial relationships between facial features. We then employ the Mahalanobis distance metric to quantify the similarity between the extracted features and a predefined set of prototypes, representing distinct facial gestures. The proposed approach is evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of facial images, yielding an accuracy of 92.5% in recognizing various facial gestures, including happy, sad, angry, and neutral expressions. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of combining correlation and Mahalanobis distance in facial gesture recognition, outperforming existing methods that rely solely on local or global features. This work contributes to the advancement of facial gesture recognition, enabling applications in human-computer interaction, emotion recognition, and social signal processing.

This\nderivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements\ninherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric\ndual (Voronoi) lattice. The orthogonality properties between these two lattices\nyield an expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is strikingly\nsimilar to the corresponding and more familiar hinge-based expression in RC\n(deficit angle per unit Voronoi dual area). In particular, we show that the\nscalar curvature is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per\nweighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us is how naturally\nspacetime is represented by Voronoi and Delaunay structures and that the laws\nof gravity appear to be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less\ncomplexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is recovered by convergence\nin mean.

We do so by means of the\nGeneralized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF)\napproach that we propose in this paper and that we developed based on the\ngeneral collective matrix factorization framework.

CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a\nparticular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus\nallowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear\nmeasurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the\nform of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by\nhigher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is\ntypically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be\nmeasured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational\nand memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive\nSensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order\ntensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced\ncomputational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes.

This paper describes technical challenges,\napproaches taken, and possible directions for future research to guide the\ndesign of efficient parallel software and hardware infrastructures.", "machine_text": "In this work, we investigate the opportunities and challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR). We focus on the latest advancements in deep learning-based approaches, which have significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of ASR systems. Our analysis reveals that the primary challenge lies in handling non-native accents, background noise, and speaker variability. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that leverages multi-task learning and transfer learning to adapt ASR models to diverse acoustic conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in ASR performance, particularly in noisy and distant-talking scenarios. We also discuss the implications of these findings for real-world applications, such as voice assistants and speech-to-text systems.

To overcome this problem, in\nthis paper we proposed a new CPD method which converts the original $N$th\n($N>3$) order tensor to a 3rd-order tensor first. Then the full CPD is realized\nby decomposing this mode reduced tensor followed by a Khatri-Rao product\nprojection procedure. This way is quite efficient as unfolding to each of the\n$N$ modes are avoided, and dimensionality reduction can also be easily\nincorporated to further improve the efficiency. We show that, under mild\nconditions, any $N$th-order CPD can be converted into a 3rd-order case but\nwithout destroying the essential uniqueness, and theoretically gives the same\nresults as direct $N$-way CPD methods.

We then derive an efficient optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the registration parameters and point set representations. Our method is demonstrated on a range of benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to accurately register point sets in the presence of noise, outliers, and complex transformations. The results highlight the robustness and efficiency of Coherent Point Drift, making it a valuable tool for a variety of applications in computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging.    "}

By formulating the clustering problem as a convex optimization problem, we can effectively handle the missing edge information and incorporate additional structural information about the graph. Our GCCO algorithm consists of two main steps: first, we solve a convex optimization problem to obtain a low-rank representation of the graph, and then we apply a spectral clustering algorithm to the resulting representation to identify clusters. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GCCO in accurately identifying clusters in partially observed graphs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering accuracy and computational efficiency.

To fill this gap, a new ALDP\nis constructed consisting of \"conditional objects\", extending ordinary\nProbability Logic, and compatible with the desired conditional probability\ninterpretation of inference rules.

Our approach is demonstrated to outperform existing speckle reduction techniques in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics, such as the coefficient of variation and the structural similarity index. The proposed method is also shown to be computationally efficient and robust to changes in image intensity and polarization.

Most of the relevant\nliterature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification\napplications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class\nin the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace\nspanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is\neasily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an\nalgorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not\nbeen seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss\nwhy previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.\nWe then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.\nSpecifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches\nrather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via\naveraging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to\nform an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations\nwithin each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to\nmisalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we\nevaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder\nNeural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on\nGaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and\nChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains\nconsiderably better and more robust performance than several previous\nstate-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set\nidentification problems.

As\nlocal descriptors like SIFT demonstrate great discriminative power in solving\nvision problems like object recognition, image classification and annotation,\nmore and more state-of-the-art large scale image retrieval systems are trying\nto rely on them. A common way to achieve this is first quantizing local\ndescriptors into visual words, and then applying scalable textual indexing and\nretrieval schemes. We call this model as bag-of-words or bag-of-features model.\nThe goal of this survey is to give an overview of this model and introduce\ndifferent strategies when building the system based on this model.", "machine_text": "We propose an image retrieval system based on the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, which leverages the power of local features to effectively capture the semantic meaning of images. By extracting a large number of local features from images, we construct a vocabulary of visual words, which are then used to represent images as histograms. The resulting BoW representation is compact, yet informative, allowing for efficient and effective image retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in various image retrieval tasks, including object recognition, scene classification, and image search. The key to our success lies in the careful selection of local features, the use of a robust vocabulary construction method, and the efficient implementation of the BoW representation. Our results show that the proposed system is capable of achieving high accuracy and robustness in image retrieval tasks, making it a promising approach for a wide range of applications.    \n\n\n\n(Generated abstract)    \n\n\n\nNote: I strictly followed your instructions and generated the abstract as requested.

Our approach leverages a novel combination of maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to efficiently explore the vast parameter space of CMB models. The resulting maps exhibit improved resolution, reduced noise, and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios compared to previous methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a suite of simulations and real-data analyses, showcasing the potential for Madam to revolutionize CMB data analysis and enable new scientific discoveries. Our results highlight the importance of carefully considering the noise properties and systematics in CMB data, and demonstrate the potential for Madam to become a leading tool in the field of CMB research.

By exploiting the structure of the data, we develop a robust factorization approach that incorporates a novel sparse coding mechanism to identify and mitigate the impact of noisy or missing entries. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in terms of accuracy and scalability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the method's robustness and sensitivity to different noise levels and node failures, highlighting its potential applications in various domains, including recommender systems, computer vision, and network analysis.

Our model, termed FuzzyTrust, leverages fuzzy logic to integrate multiple factors influencing trust, including seller reputation, product reviews, and transaction history. We employ a multi-step approach, first identifying relevant features, then constructing fuzzy sets and rules to quantify trust levels. Our model's performance is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of e-commerce transactions, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness compared to existing models. The results show that FuzzyTrust can accurately predict trust levels, effectively distinguishing between trustworthy and untrustworthy sellers. Furthermore, our model's adaptability and flexibility enable it to adapt to changing market conditions and user preferences.

We study how the\nrevenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline\nmechanism that knows the distribution (\"offline benchmark\").\n  We present a prior-independent dynamic pricing mechanism whose revenue is at\nmost $O((k \\log n)^{2/3})$ less than the offline benchmark, for every\ndistribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds without *any*\nassumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we\nprove a matching lower bound.

In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding\n`scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for\nunderstanding the intensity of the preferences.\n  In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation\nalgorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise\ncomparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the\ngraph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are\ncompared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to\nbe its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of\nthe algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model\n(equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which\neach object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes\nof pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal\nprobabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the\nBTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the\nscores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm.

Moreover, based on the same frame, we\npropose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal\nsparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The\nproposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of\nface images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face\ndatabases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the problem of feature selection for face recognition using sparse approximation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the sparsity of face representation to identify the most informative features. Our method, dubbed SparseFace, utilizes a sparse coding framework to learn a dictionary of atoms that represent the underlying structure of face images. By selecting the top-k atoms with the highest coefficients, we obtain a subset of features that are most relevant for face recognition. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseFace, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and expression.

The method is based on a key sociological insight\nthat has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,\nbut has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that\nresource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective\nconsistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments\nabout identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient\naffective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental\nsentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent\nwith, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent\nwith, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This \"affect control\nprinciple\" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In\nthis paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of\nthis principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively\nintelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain\nmultiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability\ndistribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make\nvalue-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively\nintelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,\npredicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking\nactions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We\ndemonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations.

Notably, DLG outperforms state-of-the-art gossip-based algorithms in terms of convergence speed and accuracy, while being more scalable and robust to node failures. Our results highlight the potential of DLG for large-scale machine learning applications, where data is distributed across multiple nodes and communication is limited. By exploiting the strengths of linear models and gossip-based communication, DLG provides a promising solution for efficient and decentralized machine learning in distributed systems.

In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a\nmodified Jensen-Shannon divergence ($JS_{GM}$), based on AM-GM inequality. We\nshow that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys\ndivergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical\njustifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best\nfeatures in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using\n$J-$divergence emerges naturally in binary classification. Performance and\ncomparative study of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated on large\ndimensional text and gene expression datasets that show our methods scale up\nvery well with large dimensional datasets.", "machine_text": "In this work, we address the challenge of multiclass classification by developing a generative maximum entropy learning approach that leverages the principles of statistical mechanics. We formulate the classification problem as a maximum entropy estimation task, where the goal is to infer the underlying probability distribution over the class labels. By leveraging the concept of maximum entropy, we derive a novel generative model that captures the complex relationships between the input features and the class labels. Our approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model that integrates the maximum entropy principle with a set of carefully designed prior distributions. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance for multiclass classification tasks. Our results show that the proposed generative maximum entropy learning approach can effectively handle high-dimensional data and complex class hierarchies, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the\nwidely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures.\nAlthough there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little is known about\nits theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function\nis, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as\nthe number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result\nis very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot differentiate good and\nbad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many\napplications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in\ngeneral, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This\nnotion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a\nproperty: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the\nranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost\nall datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent\ndistinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking\nfunctions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for\nNDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we\nshow that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast\nthe discount decays, and 1/r is a critical point.

These\nmodels, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving\nindividual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common\ncharacteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based\nmodelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that\novercomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential\ncontribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE\nmodelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it\npossible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do\nthe outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the\nother? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using\nestablished mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer.\nThese case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and\nthe simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our\nresults show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e.\nimplementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of\nmodels however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be\nmodelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling\nwas obtained.

We found that the model is sensitive to changes in tumour cell proliferation rates, immune cell activation, and chemokine concentrations, highlighting the importance of these factors in shaping the immune response. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between tumour cells and immune cells and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for early-stage cancer treatment.

The reservoir is often implemented as a\nhomogeneous recurrent neural network, but there has been little investigation\ninto the properties of reservoirs that are discrete and heterogeneous. Random\nBoolean networks are generic and heterogeneous dynamical systems and here we\nuse them as the reservoir. An RBN is typically a closed system; to use it as a\nreservoir we extend it with an input layer. As a consequence of perturbation,\nthe RBN does not necessarily fall into an attractor. Computational capability\nin RC arises from a trade-off between separability and fading memory of inputs.\nWe find the balance of these properties predictive of classification power and\noptimal at critical connectivity.

By exploiting the structure of the Hamiltonian matrix, we develop a method that leverages the properties of unitary matrices to efficiently simulate the evolution of quantum systems. Our approach is based on a recursive application of unitary operations, which allows us to decompose the Hamiltonian into a series of simpler components. This decomposition enables us to reduce the computational complexity of the simulation, making it more feasible for large-scale systems. Our results demonstrate that our method can accurately simulate the dynamics of quantum systems with high fidelity, outperforming existing methods in terms of computational efficiency. The key idea behind our approach is the use of a recursive unitary decomposition, which allows us to represent the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitary matrices. This representation enables us to exploit the properties of unitary matrices to simplify the simulation, leading to a significant reduction in computational complexity.

We identify key signatures that can be used to test these solutions against observational data, focusing on the large-scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation. Our results demonstrate that bimetric gravity can provide a viable alternative to dark energy, offering new avenues for understanding the evolution of the universe. By exploring the phenomenological implications of these solutions, we establish a foundation for future observational tests and provide a framework for further theoretical developments in this area.    \n\n\n\n(Word Count: 246) "}

We\nsystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical\nprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated\nfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback\nfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and\naccretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency\nis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same\nrate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting\nblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate\nbelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the\nform of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.", "machine_text": "We have used a combination of observational and theoretical approaches to investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation history. Our analysis reveals that the decline of star formation at high redshifts is driven by the gradual exhaustion of the gas reservoirs within galaxies, rather than a sudden cessation of gas accretion. We find that the depletion of gas is linked to the formation of massive black holes, which regulate the growth of their host galaxies through feedback mechanisms. Our results also suggest that the reionization of the intergalactic medium plays a crucial role in regulating the early star formation, with the ionizing radiation from the first stars and galaxies acting as a brake on the growth of the cosmic star formation rate. By combining observations of galaxy properties, such as gas fractions and black hole masses, with simulations of galaxy evolution, we have been able to constrain the physical processes that drive the cosmic star formation history. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between gas, stars, and black holes that shapes the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.    "}

Each day of the\nexercise, the systems generated 2 to 9 hour forecasts of the probabilities of\noccurrence of: non significant weather, significant weather, and severe\nweather, in each of four regions in northeastern Colorado. A verification\ncoordinator working at the Denver Weather Service Forecast Office gathered\nground-truth data from a network of observers. Systems were evaluated on the\nbasis of several measures of forecast skill, and on other metrics such as\ntimeliness, ease of learning, and ease of use. Systems were generally easy to\noperate, however the various systems required substantially different levels of\nmeteorological expertise on the part of their users--reflecting the various\noperational environments for which the systems had been designed. Systems\nvaried in their statistical behavior, but on this difficult forecast problem,\nthe systems generally showed a skill approximately equal to that of persistence\nforecasts and climatological (historical frequency) forecasts. The two systems\nthat appeared best able to discriminate significant from non significant\nweather events were traditional expert systems. Both of these systems required\nthe operator to make relatively sophisticated meteorological judgments. We are\nunable, based on only one summer's worth of data, to determine the extent to\nwhich the greater skill of the two systems was due to the content of their\nknowledge bases, or to the subjective judgments of the operator.

We compared the performance of nine knowledge-based systems, each utilizing different algorithms and data sources, on a dataset of 1,500 severe weather events. Our results show that the most accurate system, which integrated meteorological data with machine learning algorithms, achieved an accuracy rate of 85.7%. In contrast, the least accurate system, which relied solely on traditional meteorological models, achieved an accuracy rate of 55.6%. Our findings suggest that the integration of multiple data sources and algorithms is essential for accurate severe weather forecasting.

However,\nextracting structural information that is perceptually important to our visual\nsystem is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by employing a\nsparse representation-based approach and proposes a new metric called the\n\\emph{sparse representation-based quality} (SPARQ) \\emph{index}. The proposed\nmethod learns the inherent structures of the reference image as a set of basis\nvectors, such that any structure in the image can be represented by a linear\ncombination of only a few of those basis vectors. This sparse strategy is\nemployed because it is known to generate basis vectors that are qualitatively\nsimilar to the receptive field of the simple cells present in the mammalian\nprimary visual cortex. The visual quality of the distorted image is estimated\nby comparing the structures of the reference and the distorted images in terms\nof the learnt basis vectors resembling cortical cells. Our approach is\nevaluated on six publicly available subject-rated image quality assessment\ndatasets. The proposed SPARQ index consistently exhibits high correlation with\nthe subjective ratings on all datasets and performs better or at par with the\nstate-of-the-art.", "machine_text": "In this work, we propose a novel image quality assessment (IQA) approach based on sparse representation. We address the problem of evaluating the quality of images affected by various types of degradations, such as noise, blur, and compression. Our methodology relies on representing the reference and distorted images as sparse linear combinations of atoms from a dictionary. We employ the concept of reconstruction error to measure the similarity between the original and distorted images, which serves as the basis for our IQA metric. Experimental results on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately assessing image quality, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of correlation with subjective scores. Our sparse representation-based IQA approach offers a robust and efficient solution for evaluating image quality in various applications, including image processing, compression, and restoration.

The present paper gives a careful\nanalysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues\nwith it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical\nresolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical\ncriteria for hidden path recognition are shown to lead to a new class of\ndecoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual\nforward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of\nsuch estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators.\nSimilar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized\nby a small number of tunable parameters.

Specifically, we define a risk function that balances the trade-off between the probability of the observed sequence and the probability of the underlying path. We then use this risk function to guide the path inference process, selecting the path that minimizes the risk.

This transformation is a direct consequence of the lensing galaxy's mass distribution and the source's position within its gravitational potential. To quantify this effect, we employ a combination of numerical simulations and analytical calculations, leveraging the software package GLAFIC and the GalPyan formalism. Our results show that the source-position transformation is significant for sources within a few arcseconds of the lensing galaxy's center, but decreases rapidly with increasing distance. This discovery has important implications for the interpretation of strong lensing observations and the recovery of source properties from lensed images. We discuss the potential applications of our findings in the context of galaxy evolution, dark matter, and cosmology.    "}

We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised\nregularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating\nfunctions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors\nusing Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\\bf R}^n$. A\nfeature vector ${\\bf x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\{x_q\\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a\nfunction of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its\nstructure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous\nto those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on\nthe set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from\nfunction denoising on ${\\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the\ndenoising (regularization) parameter $\\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the\nnoise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction\naccuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\\alpha$ in index spaces with graph\nstructures.

Our methodology involves adding a regularization term to the loss function, which penalizes feature vectors that deviate significantly from a predefined distribution. We evaluate FVR on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing overfitting and improving model performance. Furthermore, we provide insights into the impact of FVR on feature vector representation and its relationship with model interpretability.
