The contestants are usually divided into two teams that are deemed as rival farms, and they must work together to complete group tasks such as herding animals, planting crops, or building structures. In addition to group tasks, contestants also compete individually on various challenges to gain immunity from elimination and to win various rewards. These challenges can include anything from milking cows to plowing fields. The contestants who fail to perform well in the challenges are typically put up for elimination, and the viewers at home can vote to decide which contestant should be eliminated. The show has been praised for its unique format and for showcasing the beauty of agriculture and farm life in Croatia. Viewers have also enjoyed watching the contestants bond and form relationships over the course of the show. Farma has also spawned several spin-offs, including Farma VIP, which features celebrities as contestants, and Farma New Beginning, which involves former contestants returning for a second chance at winning.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Suicide of Tyler Clementi\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tyler Clementi (December 19, 1991 – September 22, 2010) was an American student at Rutgers University–New Brunswick who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River at the age of 18, on September 22, 2010. On September 19, 2010, Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam on his dorm room computer and his hallmate Molly Wei's computer to view, without Clementi's knowledge, Clementi kissing another man. Clementi eventually found out, after Ravi posted about the webcam incident on Twitter. Two days later, Ravi urged friends and Twitter followers to watch via his webcam a second tryst between Clementi and his friend, though the viewing never occurred.\n\nRavi and Wei were federally indicted for their roles in the webcam incidents, though they were not charged with a role in the suicide itself. On May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution. Ravi went to trial in early 2012, and was convicted on May 21, 2012, on multiple charges related to the webcam viewing. After an appeals court overturned parts of the conviction, Ravi pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy on October 27, 2016.\n\nClementi's death brought national attention to the issue of cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.\n\nBackground\nClementi was born on December 19, 1991, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. A graduate of Ridgewood High School, he was a violinist; he played with the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra and participated in the Bergen Youth Orchestra as concertmaster.\n\nA few days before leaving home to attend college at Rutgers, Clementi told his parents that he was gay. While his father supported him, Clementi said in an instant message to a friend that his mother had \"basically completely rejected\" him. In later interviews, Clementi's mother explained that she had been \"sad\" and \"quiet\" as she processed the information and that she \"felt a little betrayed\" that he had not previously confided in her that he was gay. She later noted that she had not been ready as a parent to publicly acknowledge having a gay son, partly because her evangelical church had taught that homosexuality was a sin. After their conversation, she said that she and Tyler cried, hugged, and said they loved each other. Jane Clementi said that she and Tyler spent the rest of the week together and spoke frequently on the phone when he was at Rutgers. According to his mother, Tyler seemed \"confident\" and \"comfortable\" after coming out and told her of having visited New York City with new friends.\n\nRavi and Wei met while students at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. Prior to arriving at Rutgers, Ravi tried to find information about his new roommate online. On Twitter, Ravi referred to having seen Clementi's communications on JustUsBoys, a pornographic website and message board for gay men, and tweeted \"Found out my roommate is gay\". Clementi also researched his roommate and read postings on Ravi's Twitter page. After Ravi and Clementi moved in together, they rarely interacted or spoke. Ravi's text messages to friends described Clementi as shy and awkward. Clementi's online conversations and text messages referred to his amusement at Ravi's construction of a private changing area, but Clementi said he appreciated the fact that Ravi left him alone and did not force an excessively social atmosphere.\n\nWebcam incidents\n\nFirst viewings\nOn the nights of September 19 and 21, Clementi had asked Ravi to use their room for those evenings. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two wanted to be alone for the evening. Ravi has stated that he was worried about theft and that he left the computer in a state where he could view the webcam stream due to those concerns. Other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Later, Wei turned on the camera for another view with four others in the room, though Ravi was not there. During this second viewing, Wei and others saw Clementi and his guest kissing with their shirts off and their pants on.\n\nOn September 20, Clementi, who followed Ravi's Twitter account, read a message that Ravi sent a few minutes after the webcam viewing the previous day. Ravi wrote: \"Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.\" According to a Rutgers employee, at about 4 a.m. on September 21, Clementi sent an online request for a single room because his \"roommate used webcam to spy on me.\"\n\nSecond attempt\nOn September 21, Ravi posted text messages saying that there would be a viewing party to watch Clementi and his guest, along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39 p.m., Ravi tweeted, \"Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again.\" Ravi had set up the webcam and pointed it towards Clementi's bed. When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.\n\nThe same day, Clementi complained to a resident assistant and two other officials that Ravi had used a webcam to stream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote \"I feel that my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.\" Clementi wrote in detail on the JustUsBoys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated that he did not want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. \"He [the resident assistant] seemed to take it seriously,\" Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWithin a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm room and he and Ravi were there for less than an hour.\n\nSuicide\n\nOn the evening of September 22, Clementi left the dorm room, bought food from the campus food court, and, around 6:30 p.m., headed toward the George Washington Bridge. By 8:42 p.m. he had posted from his cell phone on Facebook: \"Jumping off the gw bridge sorry\".\n\nClementi left a suicide note which, along with documents on his computer, was never released to either the public or to the defense team in Ravi's trial, because Clementi's suicide was not directly related to the charges against Ravi.\n\nClementi's wallet, car, cell phone, and computer were found on or near the bridge. His body was found on September 29, in the Hudson River just north of the bridge. The medical examiner gave drowning as the cause of death, noting blunt impact injuries to the torso as well.\n\nReaction\nShortly after Clementi's suicide, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, \"There has been heightened media attention surrounding the suicides in New Jersey, Texas, California, Indiana, and Minnesota.\" The same month Clementi died, four other Americans were reported to have committed suicide after being taunted about their homosexuality, although the brother of one of the deceased said he did not believe the suicide was brought on by bullying.\n\nAt Rutgers University\nRutgers University students planned a \"Black Friday\" event to commemorate and memorialize Clementi. Rutgers president Richard Levis McCormick stated, \"We grieve for him and for his family, friends and classmates as they deal with the tragic loss of a gifted young man....\"\n\nBeginning in the 2011–2012 school year, a Rutgers University pilot program was instituted to permit students to choose their dorm roommates, regardless of gender. Members of the university's LGBT community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create a more inclusive environment for students.\n\nBy September 2012, Rutgers had implemented numerous new programs to provide a more supportive environment for LGBT students, in reaction to the suicide, including new dormitory options and a new Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities, and students reported a much-improved campus atmosphere.\n\nCharitable response\nIn 2011, Tyler Clementi's parents, Jane and Joseph Clementi, established the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on promoting acceptance of LGBT teens and others marginalized by society, providing education against all forms of bullying including cyber bullying over the internet and promoting research and development into the causes and prevention of teenage suicide.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, the Point Foundation, the nation's largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBT students of merit, announced that it had created the Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship to honor Clementi's memory. Clementi's parents said they hoped the scholarship would \"raise awareness of young people who are subject to abuse through malicious bullying.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Tyler Clementi Foundation launched #Day1, an anti-bullying campaign that aims to stop bullying before it begins, with support from Caitlyn Jenner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.\n\nGovernment\nTyler Clementi's suicide, along with the suicides of several other gay teens who had been harassed, moved President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to express shock and sadness and speak out against any form of bullying. US Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey introduced federal legislation titled the \"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\", to require schools that wish to receive federal funding to establish anti-bullying procedures and codes of conduct.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie stated that the suicide was an \"unspeakable tragedy... I don't know how those two folks [Ravi and Wei] are going to sleep at night\" and added, \"as the father of a 17-year-old, I can't imagine what those parents are feeling today—I can't.\" In response to Clementi's suicide and other, similar incidents, New Jersey General Assembly representatives Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Mary Pat Angelini introduced a bipartisan \"Anti-bullying Bill of Rights\" in November 2010, which passed on a 71–1 vote in the New Jersey Assembly and a 30–0 vote in the New Jersey Senate.\n\nThe San Diego Unified School District Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to provide a safe environment and equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning students.\n\nParents' statements\nThe day of the announcement of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people:\n\nIn the same statement, Jane Clementi, Tyler's mother, noted the role that electronic media can have in singling out LGBT youth for being different. She said:\n\nAdvocacy\nIn the weeks following Clementi's suicide, schools around the area of his residence held vigils in memory of his death. Students at Hofstra University gathered for a candlelight vigil, and students and staff at Pascack Hills High School in Bergen County, near Ridgewood where Clementi lived, wore all black to mourn his death.\n\nThe incident brought wider nationwide attention to bullying of LGBT youth. \"Spirit Day\", first observed on October 20, 2010, was established in which people wear the color purple to show support for bullying victims among LGBT youth. Clementi's suicide inspired the establishment of Spirit Day, and the day received widespread support from GLAAD, Hollywood celebrities and over 1.6 million Facebook users. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights advocacy organization, released a plan aimed at increasing awareness of gay-related suicide and harassment around the U.S. According to gay activist William Dobbs, around 10,000 people expressed support on social networking websites for lodging more serious criminal charges, such as manslaughter, against Ravi and Wei, a position that Dobbs himself criticized as a rush to judgment before an investigation had taken place.\n\nHowever, journalist Jason St. Amand has noted that \"there are surprisingly several gay activists who are skeptical about the case and believe that Ravi is being used as a scapegoat and should receive a lesser sentence.\" William Dobbs has criticized the use of hate crime charges and what he considers to have been a hurried scapegoating of Ravi and Wei. Journalist J. Bryan Lowder has similarly criticized hate-crime laws, arguing that Ravi's motives are difficult to know, and that Ravi should not be blamed for attitudes that are \"pervasive in our culture\". Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, has written that, although he considers Ravi's actions to have been \"the last straw\" that triggered Clementi's suicide, he notes that Clementi's guest did not die by suicide, and concludes that there must have been additional factors, preceding the webcam incidents, contributing to the suicide. Savage says that he deplores the \"mob mentality\" that focuses on \"a couple of stupid teenagers who should've known better but didn't.\" He argues that attention should also be directed toward the \"adults and institutions\" in society who \"perpetuate anti-gay prejudice\", and he concludes that to \"pin all the blame\" on Ravi and Wei amounts to \"a coverup\". After Ravi was sentenced, Savage said he had been \"express[ing] misgivings about the severity of the sentence that Ravi faced. But a 30 day sentence is far, far too lenient—a slap on the wrist.\" Eric Marcus has compared his own father's suicide with Clementi's, and said that it will not be possible to know the real reasons for Clementi's suicide. He concluded that \"At best, we can say that Ravi's spying and subsequent Twitter messages might have triggered Clementi's suicide, which is different from causing his suicide... We've turned Tyler Clementi into a two-dimensional symbol of anti-gay bullying and Dharun Ravi into a scapegoat. This is a case that screams out for compassion and understanding.\"\n\nThe Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety, a legal institute to assist other victims of cyberbullying, was launched in October 2015.\n\nCriticism of media coverage\nSoon after invasion of privacy charges were brought against Ravi and Wei, gay advocacy groups and bloggers were vocal in their support for bringing hate-crime charges against the defendants. After the prosecutors issued a public statement that they were investigating whether bias played a role in the incident, according to Chris Cuomo of ABC News, a \"media floodgate of distortion\" ensued. Writing in The New Yorker, Ian Parker has stated that some of the media coverage and the public outcry against Ravi have exaggerated Ravi's role in the incident, writing that after Clementi's suicide \"it became widely understood that a closeted student at Rutgers had committed suicide after video of him having sex with a man was secretly shot and posted online. In fact, there was no posting, no observed sex, and no closet.\"\n\nIn popular culture\nEllen DeGeneres described herself as \"devastated\" by Clementi's death, stating, \"Something must be done. This month alone, there has been a shocking number of news stories about teens who have been teased and bullied and then committed suicide... This needs to be a wake-up call to everyone: teenage bullying and teasing is an epidemic in this country, and the death rate is climbing.\"\n\nThe band Rise Against released a song, \"Make It Stop (September's Children)\", which mentions the names of Tyler Clementi and four other young people who died by suicide in September 2010 after being bullied based on their sexual orientation.\n\nMadonna gave tribute to Clementi by showing a picture of him and other gay teens who have died by suicide during the Nobody Knows Me video interlude in the MDNA Tour. Canadian musician Owen Pallett released a song called \"The Secret Seven\" on his 2014 album In Conflict that addresses Clementi.\n\nMonica Lewinsky said that Clementi's story inspired her to speak out against cyberbullying, in a TED talk called The Price of Shame.\n\nCourt case\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Dharun Ravi and Molly Wei were each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 webcam transmission. Ravi was charged with two additional counts for the September 21 viewing attempt. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Wei entered a plea agreement allowing her to avoid prosecution in exchange for her testimony against Ravi, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and classes on dealing with people of alternative lifestyles.\n\nOn March 16, 2012, Ravi was convicted on all 15 counts for his role in the webcam spying incidents. On May 21, 2012, Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years' probation, 300 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternative lifestyles. Both the prosecutors and Ravi filed separate appeals. On June 18, 2012, Ravi was released from jail after 20 days of his sentence. Federal immigration authorities said that Ravi would not be deported to India.\n\nIn February 2016, Ravi asked the courts to overturn his convictions following a 2015 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that struck down as unconstitutionally vague a part of the law under which he was charged. In September 2016, the convictions were overturned by an appeals court in New Jersey, in a decision supported by prosecutors because of the earlier ruling on constitutionality. A request to maintain the convictions for other crimes, such as invasion of privacy and witness tampering, was denied because of the influence bias allegations. Ravi accepted a plea deal on October 27, 2016, and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted invasion of privacy, a third-degree felony. He was sentenced to time already served and fines paid, and the remaining charges against him were dropped.\n\nSee also \n\n The Trevor Project\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Tyler Clementi Foundation\n Tyler Clementi Point Scholarship\n \n\n2010 in LGBT history\n2010 in New York City\nBullying and suicide\nCollege students who committed suicide\nDeaths by person in the United States\nGay history\nLGBT history in New York City\nSuicide of Tyler Clementi\nSuicides by jumping in New York City\nVictims of cyberbullying\nDiscrimination against LGBT people in the United States\nBullying in the United States\nSeptember 2010 events in the United States\nLGBT-related suicides\n2010 suicides\n20th-century LGBT people\n21st-century LGBT people", "machine_text": "Tyler Clementi was a promising, young violinist and a student at Rutgers University in New Jersey, United States. On September 22, 2010, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge. The suicide was a result of Clementi’s humiliation and harassment by his roommate, Dharun Ravi, who had recorded and livestreamed Clementi’s private sexual encounter with another man. This event drew national attention and opened up conversations about anti-LGBTQ+ bullying, cyber-harassment, and the power of social media. Clementi was an 18-year-old freshman when he moved into his dorm room at Rutgers. Less than a month into his first semester, he arranged for a male visitor to spend the night in their shared room while Ravi was out. Ravi discovered this and setup a webcam that recorded Clementi’s private encounter. The recording was then livestreamed on Ravi’s Twitter account, and he encouraged his followers to watch the feed. Ravi also took to Twitter to publicly shame and ridicule Clementi. Ravi's actions were motivated by Clementi’s sexual orientation and disregard for his privacy. Clementi’s death led to a national conversation about the treatment and discrimination of the LGBTQ+ community and cyber-bullying. In March 2012, Ravi was convicted of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, and witness tampering in Clementi’s death. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 300 hours of community service, counseling, and a $10,000 fine. The lenient sentence provoked outrage and highlighted the shortcomings of hate crime laws. In response to Tyler Clementi’s death, President Barack Obama released a statement calling for zero-tolerance policies for bullying, harassment, and discrimination in schools, colleges, universities, and workplaces. The Tyler Clementi Foundation was established by his family in his memory, which aims to promote safe, inclusive, and respectful environments for LGBTQ+ individuals and their allies. The foundation also seeks to prevent cyberbullying and promote empathetic demand for LGBT+ participation in the American national effort.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29016074}

It was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's SmackDown! brand division. The event took place on May 22, 2005, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe main event was an \"I Quit\" match featuring two wrestlers fighting until one stated \"I Quit.\" WWE Champion John Cena defeated John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) to retain his championship. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In respective standard wrestling matches, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero and Booker T defeated Kurt Angle.\n\nJudgment Day grossed over $500,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 9,500, and received 220,000 pay-per-view buys. This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $4.7 million compared to the previous year.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nJudgment Day was first held by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the 25th In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) in October 1998. It then returned in May 2000 as its own event, establishing Judgment Day as the promotion's annual May PPV. The 2005 event was the seventh event in the Judgment Day chronology and was held on May 22 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Like the previous year's event, it featured wrestlers exclusively from the SmackDown! brand.\n\nStorylines\nThe event featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character. All wrestlers were from the SmackDown! brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being Raw.\n\nThe main event at Judgment Day was between John Cena and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) over the WWE Championship in an \"I Quit\" match. The previous month at WrestleMania 21, Cena defeated JBL to win the WWE Championship. On the April 7 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a series of number one contenders matches, after JBL, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, The Big Show, Booker T, and Kurt Angle all demanded a WWE Championship match. The first match that Long announced was between JBL and Rey Mysterio. Mysterio was disqualified, after Eddie Guerrero interfered and attacked JBL, resulting in JBL winning the match. The following week on SmackDown!, Guerrero and Kurt Angle were scheduled for the second contender's match. Angle advanced to the finals, as he went on to defeat Guerrero. Later during the program, Cena unveiled a spinner version of the WWE championship. Before the unveiling, however, JBL came out wearing the original WWE championship. On the April 21 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T and Big Show were booked in another contenders match. After the match ended in a double disqualification, Long booked JBL, Angle, Booker T, and Big Show in a Fatal Four-Way match for the following week. JBL won the match, after he pinned Angle and having the right to face Cena at Judgment Day for the WWE Championship. On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, Cena proposed that he would defend the championship against JBL in an \"I Quit\" match. Two weeks later, on the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL faced Scotty 2 Hotty, which Scotty won after JBL was disqualified. After the match, however, JBL attacked Scotty and demanded that he say \"I quit.\" JBL further the assault, choking him with a leather belt, Scotty said \"I quit.\" That same night, Cena defeated The Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham) in a handicap match. During the duration of the match, JBL, who was at ringside, yelled at Cena, telling him to say \"I quit.\"\n\nOne of the featured preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. One month prior to Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Mysterio defeated Guerrero. In the weeks that followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the WWE Tag Team Championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Theodore Long booked a Street Fight between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match (which Mysterio won), Chavo, Mercury, and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.\n\nThe other featured preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T in a singles match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Angle, Booker T, Big Show and JBL took part in a Fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship, which JBL won. During the match, Angle hit Booker T with a steel chair to eliminate him. Booker came back and hit Angle with a chair to cause him to be eliminated. The following week, Angle challenged Booker T to a match at Judgment Day, which Booker accepted. Prior to that, Angle had insulted Booker T's wife, Sharmell, which led to Booker T attacking and accepting Angle's challenge. On the May 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle admitted he would like to have \"perverted sex\" with Sharmell. That same night, Angle and Booker T were scheduled in a match, which led to Angle leaving the ring and going backstage to Sharmell. Booker T went backstage and found Sharmell on the floor crying. This led to Angle attacking Booker T from behind and pushing him towards a pair of steel lockers. The following week, Long suspended Angle and demanded that Angle apologize for his actions. Angle apologized, but admitted that he actually kissed Sharmell and let her fondle his \"private parts\" before Booker T made his way to the locker room. Booker T, while watching the interview kicked a television monitor down and broke it.\n\n#1 contender tournament bracket\n\nEvent\n\nBefore the Judgment Day event aired live on pay-per-view, Nunzio defeated Akio in a match that aired on Sunday Night Heat.\n\nPreliminary matches\n\nAfter Sunday Night Heat, the pay-per-view began with a tag team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match and was able to tag in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a Snapshot to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the tag team titles.\n\nThe second wrestling match on the pay-per-view was The Big Show versus Carlito, who was accompanied by Matt Morgan. For the duration of the match, Big Show used his body size to his advantage as he squashed, or easily and quickly performed moves on Carlito. The momentum changed, when Carlito gained control part way through the match. In the end, Big Show accidentally whipped Carlito into the referee. This saw Carlito hit a low blow on Big Show. Carlito won the match and gained the successful pinfall after Morgan delivered an F-5 to Big Show.\n\nThe next match was a standard match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Paul London defended the title against Chavo Guerrero. After back and forth action between the two, London was able to perform a 450° splash. London then pinned Guerrero to retain the WWE Cruiserweight title.\n\nThe final preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle into the ring ropes and executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed from the mouth. The match saw exchange offense from both Angle and Booker T. The match came to an end when Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Booker T grabbed Angle's leg and rolled him into a pinfall victory.\n\nMain event matches\n\nThe first featured match was for the WWE United States Championship, where Orlando Jordan defended the title against Heidenreich. As the match began, Jordan was able to perform a dropkick, sending Heidenreich through the ropes to the outside. Heidenreich, however, would gain the advantage after countering Jordan's attack from the top rope into a suplex. Afterwards, Jordan delivered a DDT and pinned Heidenreich to retain the United States title.\n\nThe next match was Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a standard match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when he was able to execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won after Guerrero was disqualified for attacking him with a steel chair.\n\nThe main event was the \"I Quit\" match for the WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena came out on the flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a turntable mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. Cena performed a Back Body Drop through an announce table on JBL. Shortly after, JBL struck Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. JBL performed a Clothesline from Hell on Cena, who later performed an FU on JBL. Later in the match, in the ramp area, Cena threw JBL through a television monitor, causing JBL to bleed. JBL quit as Cena prepared to attacked him with an exhaust pipe, which was from the semi truck, meaning Cena retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Cena struck JBL with the exhaust pipe, causing him to fall through a glass panel that was part of the entrance stage.\n\nReception\nThe Target Center had a maximum capacity of 20,000, which was reduced for the event. This event grossed over $500,000 from an approximate attendance of 9,500, the maximum allowed. It also received 220,000 pay-per-view buys. Judgment Day helped WWE earn $21.6 million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $16.9 million the previous year, which was later confirmed by Linda McMahon on September 7, 2005 in a quarterly result. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event a 5 out of 10 stars. The rating was lower than the Judgment Day event in 2006, which was said to be an entertaining pay-per-view to watch. The \"I Quit\" match between John Cena and JBL was rated an eight out of 10 stars. Additionally, the match between Orlando Jordan and Heidenreich was rated a 4 out of 10 stars.\n\nThe event was released on DVD on June 21, 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nAftermath\nOn the June 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, John Cena's SmackDown! tenure came to an end when he became the first wrestler selected by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff in the draft lottery, a mock sports draft lottery in which wrestlers switched programs. Cena immediately entered a staged rivalry with Eric Bischoff after when he refused to participate in Bischoff's \"war\" against the upcoming Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion show. Cena went on to resume his feud with Christian, as they had an encounter at the Royal Rumble in January. During the feud, Chris Jericho was involved as well, as he protested Bischoff's actions of scheduling a WWE championship match between Cena and Christian at Vengeance. After defeating Christian and Tyson Tomko in a tag team match, Jericho betrayed Cena. Convinced with the outcome of the events, Bischoff changed the original match between Christian and Cena to a Triple Threat Match, involving Jericho for the WWE Championship at Vengeance. At the event, Cena retained the WWE Championship.\n\nOn the June 30 episode of SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers for a new top-tier SmackDown! championship was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long announced that he was still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of Raw, Kurt Angle's tenure with SmackDown! came to an end, as he was also drafted to the Raw brand. There, he immediately continued his feud with Shawn Michaels. At the start of the year, Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the January pay-per-view event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to an ankle lock submission hold. The same evening Angle was drafted, Michaels challenged Angle to a WrestleMania 21 rematch at Vengeance, in which Angle accepted. At Vengeance, the rematch saw Michaels defeat Angle.\n\nThe angle between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued. On an episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominik. This led the families of both Guerrero and Mysterio pleading with Guerrero not to reveal the secret. At the Great American Bash, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match where if Guerrero lost, he could not reveal the secret. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero, however, revealed the secret, claiming he was Dominick's scripted biological father. The storyline also went on that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick to be raised by Mysterio's family. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. This led to a Ladder match, a match where the objective was to climb a ladder and reach an object hanging above the ring, between the two for the custody of Dominick at SummerSlam, which Mysterio won.\n\nResults\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n(2005).

Fishman (Ph.D., 1978) is a communication scholar specializing in communication law, crisis communication, public relations, media criticism, broadcast regulations, and public speaking at Boston College.\n\nEducation\nFishman completed his undergraduate coursework at the University of Minnesota, and he received both of his graduate degrees from Northwestern University where he was briefly employed.\n\nCareer\nFishman currently serves as associate professor and assistant chair of the department of communication at Boston College. He also holds the position of first vice president-elect of the Eastern Communication Association. In addition, he is the chair of the Eastern Communication Association's Task Force on the Status of Interest Groups, and the vice-chair and primary planner for the Commission on Parliamentary Procedure's associated with the National Communication Association (Boston College).\n\nHe has received awards for his contributions to the field, including the 1998 Haiman Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Freedom of Expression from the National Communication Association, the 2001 Phifer Award for Outstanding Scholarship in Parliamentary Procedure from the Commission on American Parliamentary Practice, the 2001 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention, and the 2003 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention.\n\nContributions and works \nFishman's most cited piece of literature is titled “ValuJet Flight 592: Crisis communication theory blended and extended.” In this work, Fishman uses the communication surrounding the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 as the scenario for which he applies a type of blended methodology approach to crisis communication. The blend he devised uses components from three previously existing crisis communication theories: Steven Fink's Natural History Approach, William Benoit's Image Restoration Approach, and Thomas Birkland's Focusing Events Approach.\n\nThe paper begins by discussing the event the blended method is being applied to (the disaster itself). An introduction to some of the communication surrounding the event is presented,  including public addresses from  Senior Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officer David Hinsonand, and a  damage control speech given by the United States Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, who is quoted in the paper saying, \"I've flown ValuJet. ValuJet is a safe airline, as is our entire aviation system. Whenever we have found any issues, ValuJet has been responsive, they have been cooperative, they have in some cases even exceeded the safety standards that we have.\"\n\nThe paper then defines crisis communication largely in terms of what is and is not a legitimate crisis situation, and how the word is improperly used in many context today. It is continued by briefly explaining each of the three approaches that are used to create the blended methodology. In the paper Fishman states, “The models used in conjunction strengthen rather than undermine the claims that each approach offers, and that each model provides insights that reinforce constructs that the other model ignores or undervalues.” He applies his blend to the ValuJet crisis by demonstrating what pieces of each model most appropriately fit each step in the crisis communication process. For example, he applies the Prodromal Stage of Fink's model to the initial occurrence of the ValuJet crash, because Benoit's model would require an accusation, and is more appropriate than Birkland's “focusing event” concept. This application theme continues throughout the paper, thus making Fishman's large contribution blended methodology.\n\nFishman does, however, state in the paper that the blended theory method may not be applicable in all crisis communication situations. However, he finds many scenarios in which he his blended methodology was applicable. Among these are the United States Navy’s 1991 Tailhook sexual misconduct scandal, Tylenol's 1982 cyanide mishap, Exxon's 1989 Valdez oil spill, and more.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\nBoston College people\nUniversity of Minnesota alumni\nNorthwestern University alumni\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": "D.A.

Obtaining planning permission is often an example of a process which can significantly enhance the value of land over and above the cost of gaining the permission, and the overage provision may state a percentage of the resultant land value increase which is due to the vendor.\n\nOverage does not solely relate to land and property and could be written into any contract for a sale of goods. Therefore, if an old classic car in poor condition was to be sold to someone with the intent of refurbishing it and then selling it on, the original seller may choose to sell the car at a very low value and contract to receive a percentage of the uplift from the next sale as well.\n\nIn the England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division), the 2008 case of Micro Design Group Ltd & Anor v BDW Trading Ltd. raised issues of whether an overage payment was due after planning permission had been obtained by the seller rather than the buyer.\n\nLawyer Alexandra Lethbridge notes that in other UK cases, the case law on overage is \"developing fast\".

It is a common practice in the real estate industry, particularly in transactions involving large land deals. The concept of land-sale overage is relatively simple. When a developer purchases land, they do so with the hope of increasing its value through development. In some cases, they may sell the land for a profit, but in other cases, they may develop the land themselves and sell completed properties. If the value of the land or property increases, the developer is obliged to pay a share of the profit to the original owner. This share is known as overage. Overage clauses are usually included in the sale agreement and are designed to protect the interests of the original owner. The precise terms of overage payments can vary, but they typically involve a percentage of any increase in value above a certain threshold. This threshold may be based on the original purchase price of the land or on a specific level of profit that the developer is aiming to achieve. Land-sale overage is a popular tool for investors who want to maximize their returns while minimizing their risk. By agreeing to an overage clause, developers have a strong incentive to ensure that their development is successful. This can lead to more significant and more sustainable projects that benefit both the investor and the local community. In conclusion, land-sale overage is an essential aspect of real estate transactions. It provides an added layer of protection for the original owner of the land and encourages developers to invest in sustainable, high-quality developments. While the terms of overage payments can vary, the fundamental principle remains the same: sharing the rewards of successful development with those who made it possible in the first place.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6259210}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nefopam\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Nefopam, sold under the brand name Acupan among others, is a centrally acting, non-opioid painkilling medication, that is primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain.\n\nNefopam acts in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain via novel mechanisms: antinociceptive effects from triple monoamine reuptake inhibition, and antihyperalgesic activity through modulation of glutamatergic transmission.\n\nMedical uses\nNefopam is effective for prevention of shivering during surgery or recovery from surgery. Nefopam was significantly more effective than aspirin as an analgesic in one clinical trial, although with a greater incidence of side effects such as sweating, dizziness and nausea, especially at higher doses. The estimated relative potency of nefopam to morphine indicates that 20 mg of nefopam HCl is the approximate analgesic equal of 12 mg of morphine with comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, or oxycodone, while nefopam tends to produce fewer side effects, does not produce respiratory depression, and has much less abuse potential, and so is useful either as an alternative to opioid analgesics, or as an adjunctive treatment for use alongside opioids or other types of analgesics. Nefopam is also used to treat severe hiccups.\n\nContraindications\nNefopam is contraindicated in people with convulsive disorders, those that have received treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine or isocarboxazid within the past 30 days and those with myocardial infarction pain, mostly due to a lack of safety data in these conditions.\n\nSide effects\nCommon side effects include nausea, nervousness, dry mouth, light-headedness and urinary retention. Less common side effects include vomiting, blurred vision, drowsiness, sweating, insomnia, headache, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, aggravation of angina and rarely a temporary and benign pink discolouration of the skin or erythema multiforme.\n\nOverdose\nOverdose and death have been reported with nefopam. Overdose usually manifests with convulsions, hallucinations, tachycardia, and hyperdynamic circulation. Treatment is usually supportive, managing cardiovascular complications with beta blockers and limiting absorption with activated charcoal.\n\nInteractions \n\nIt has additive anticholinergic and sympathomimetic effects with other agents with these properties. Its use should be avoided in people receiving some types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) as there is the potential for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crises to result.\n\nPharmacology\n\nThe mechanism of action of nefopam and its analgesic effects are not well understood, although inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopamine (that is, acting as an ) is thought to be involved. It also reduces glutamate signaling via modulating sodium and calcium channels.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nThe absolute bioavailability of nefopam is low. It is reported to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations between 49 and 183 nM. The drug is approximately 73% protein-bound across a plasma range of 7 to 226 ng/mL (28–892 nM). The metabolism of nefopam is hepatic, by N-demethylation and via other routes. Its terminal half-life is 3 to 8 hours, while that of its active metabolite, desmethylnefopam, is 10 to 15 hours. It is eliminated mostly in urine, and to a lesser extent in feces.\n\nChemistry\nNefopam is a cyclized analogue of orphenadrine, diphenhydramine, and tofenacin, with each of these compounds different from one another only by the presence of one or two carbons. The ring system of nefopam is a benzoxazocine system.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nRecreational use\nRecreational use of nefopam has rarely been reported, and is far less common than with opioid analgesics.\n\nNames\nIn the 1960s, when it was first developed, it had the generic name fenazoxine.\n\nSee also \n Troparil\n\nReferences \n\nAnalgesics\nDrugs with unknown mechanisms of action\nMuscarinic antagonists\nNitrogen heterocycles\nOxygen heterocycles\nSodium channel blockers", "machine_text": "Nefopam, also known as Acupan, is a non-opioid analgesic drug used for the management of moderate to severe pain. It was first developed in France in the 1960s, and has been widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. Nefopam works by blocking the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which are involved in pain modulation. This mechanism of action gives it a unique advantage over other painkillers, as it is not addictive and does not cause respiratory depression. Clinical trials have shown that Nefopam is effective in treating various types of pain, including postoperative pain, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain. It has also been used successfully in the treatment of migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, and other painful conditions. One of the advantages of Nefopam is that it has relatively fewer side effects compared to other painkillers. However, it can cause nausea, dizziness, and headache in some patients. It should also be avoided in patients with seizure disorders, as it can lower the seizure threshold. Nefopam is available in various forms, including oral tablets, injectable solutions, and suppositories. The dosage and duration of treatment depend on the patient's condition and response to therapy. In conclusion, Nefopam is a safe and effective alternative to opioids for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It has a unique mechanism of action and relatively fewer side effects compared to other painkillers. However, it should be used with caution in patients with certain medical conditions, and under the supervision of a healthcare provider.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15697659}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Arthur Arz von Straußenburg\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Generaloberst Arthur Freiherr Arz von Straußenburg (; 16 June 1857 – 1 July 1935) was an Austro-Hungarian colonel general and last Chief of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army. At the outbreak of the First World War, he commanded the 15th Infantry Division. Soon, he was promoted to the head of the 6th Corps and the First Army. He participated on the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in 1915 and the countryside of Romania in 1916. In March 1917, he became Chief of the General Staff until his resignation on 3 November 1918.\n\nEarly life\nBorn into a Protestant family that was among the ancient Saxon settlers of east Transylvania, Arz was the product of a noble \"Siebenbürger\" family. His father, Albert Arz von Straußenburg, served as an evangelical preacher and curate as well as a member of the House of Magnates. Schooled in Dresden and Hermannstadt, Arz graduated \"with great achievement\", and went on to read law at a university, during which time he volunteered for one year's service in a Hungarian Feldjäger battalion during 1876–1877.\n\nEarly career\nHaving successfully completed a year's military service, Arz sat and passed the reserve officers examination and went on to apply for and successfully obtain a commission as a regular officer. In 1878, he was commissioned with the rank Leutnant.\n\n \nAttaining the rank of Oberleutnant, Arz attended the Imperial Kriegschule in Vienna, 1885–1887, where he again distinguished himself, and in 1888 he was appointed to the General Staff. Promoted to Hauptmann and assigned to a corps staff, Arz was made Adjutant to Feldzeugmeister Baron Schönfelda before returning to the General Staff in 1898, where he was to remain, with a few breaks, until 1908.\n\nPromoted next to the rank of Major, then Oberstleutnant, Arz was attached to the 2nd Corps, then commanded by Archduke Eugen, following his assignment to the General Staff.  On 1 May 1902 he was promoted to Oberst and appointed to the managing bureau of the General Staff, of which department he was appointed head in May 1903. The same year, he married Stefanie Tomka von Tomkahaza und Falkusfalva, a Hungarian noblewoman,  with whom he had a daughter.\n\nIn 1908, Arz was again promoted, this time to the rank of Generalmajor, and was given command of the 61st Infantry Brigade. Having been steadily promoted and seen as a promising and competent officer, he received an \"outstanding\" evaluation from his old commander, Archduke Eugen, during 1911's fall maneuvres. 1912 saw him promoted to command a division, the 15th infantry at Miskolc. Soon afterwards Arz attained the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant and in 1913 was reassigned to the war ministry in Vienna to head up a section.\n\nFirst World War\n\nThe opening\nAt the outbreak of war in the Summer of 1914, Arz von Straussenburg requested a transfer to a field assignment and was again given command of the 15th infantry division, which participated in the closing stages of Komarów. Almost immediately thereafter, on 7 September, Arz was given command of the 6th corps, taking over from Boroević, who had been appointed to command the Third Army. In charge of the 6th Corps, he performed outstandingly and with great energy at Limanowa-Lapanów, where his unit formed part of the 4th Army. At Gorlice-Tarnów he was again to play an outstanding role and was in command again at Grodek-Magierow and Brest-litowsk during the summer of 1915. In September 1915, he was promoted to the rank of General der Infanterie, and having fought alongside Mackensen's 11th army he gained the respect of the Germans in his abilities as a commander.\n\nThe Romanian Campaign\n\nWith the threatened entry of Romania into the war on the Allied side, Arz was reassigned from the 6th Corps and appointed to command the newly reorganised 1st Army on 16 August 1916. Arriving at Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania), where forces were being marshalled to repel an expected Romanian advance into Transylvania, he stated \"I am an Army Commander without an Army\". Indeed, on the Romanian declaration of war on 27 August, the 1st 'Army' comprised a mere 10,000 men (half a division). A slow Romanian advance combined with hysterical outcry from Budapest led to the 1st Army being considerably and rapidly strengthened to drive back the challenge from the south.  \n\nRomanian forces crossed the frontier on 28 August 1916 with six separate forces pushing through the six Carpathian passes to converge on Brassó (today Braşov, Romania). By 4 September they had succeeded in pushing nearly as far as Sepsiszentgyörgy in the Székely territories. In order to fend off these six separate invasions, Arz, now fighting on his home turf, ordered the 71st Infantry Division and 141st and 142nd Brigades to the sector. Simultaneously, the Romanian North Army sought to advance along the entire Moldavian front in the Eastern Carpathians, although in fact this amounted to an advance in the northern sector, where the Russian 9th Army was best placed to aid the advance. To counter this strike, Arz deployed the 16th, 19th and elements of the 61st divisions.\n\nIn cooperation with the German 9th Army, the Romanian invasion was repelled and its forces were thrown back across the border within eight weeks, leading to Arz receiving the respect and appreciation of the new Austro-Hungarian emperor, Karl I. Other commanders also hailed his achievements during the campaign, with Conrad writing that he had \"proved to be an energetic resolute leader in the most difficult situations...\" and Boroević stating that Arz was an \"Honourable, noble character....outstanding general.\"\n\nArz was to remain in charge of the 1st Army until February 1917, after major operations in Romania ended, with help from Falkenhayn 9th German Army and from the German Army of the Danube under Mackensen.\n\nChief of General Staff\n\nKarl I of Austria succeeded Franz Joseph as Emperor on 21 November 1916, bringing with him a wave of change across the upper echelons of the government and military command. One casualty of these changes was Conrad, with Karl reported as \"not wanting a genius to command his armies\", but following on from the experience of the supremely gifted but often unsuccessful Conrad, rather someone who was just capable. Arz was acquainted with the emperor; not only was he a capable commander of troops, but he also possessed a conciliatory manner which did not make the Emperor feel he was being patronised during discussions on military matters, as was the case with other commanders. Unlike Conrad, Arz was not overtly political, was wholly committed to the Central Powers, and had full faith in the Emperor.\n\nOnce appointed in March 1917, Arz made every effort to comply with the Emperor's wishes, but unlike his predecessor he acted as a personal advisor to the Emperor on army matters, rather than as a driver of his own strategy, which had been Conrad's hallmark. His tenure at the head of the army saw increasing German control over Austro-Hungarian forces and reduced independence of action, but also a number of notable victories in the spring and summer of 1917, including the clearing of Galicia and the Bukovina, as well as the breakthrough at Flitsch Tolmein and the great victory at Caporetto later in the year.\n\nPromoted to the rank of Generaloberst on 26 February 1918, and also raised to the nobility early the same year, Arz was ultimately responsible for planning the invasion of Italy which was to take place during the summer of 1918, with Russia now knocked out of the war and a good number of experienced forces at his disposal. While planning was underway, both Conrad and Boroević demanded to lead the offensive, and neither Arz nor the AOK was able to make a decisive decision. Instead a compromise suggested by the Emperor was adopted, with their forces divided and sent to attack Italian positions on the front from two different directions. This resulted in the utter failure of the offensive at the Piave River in June 1918.\n\nArz took full responsibility for the failure of the massive invasion of Italy and tendered his resignation, but the Emperor refused to accept it, even after Generaloberst Schönburg-Hartenstein had said to the Emperor's face that the army had lost all confidence in Arz. By late October 1918, Arz could see that ultimate defeat for the Imperial forces was inevitable. He had drawn up plans for an orderly troop withdrawal in the event of an armistice, so as to prevent unnecessary further bloodshed. An armistice with Italy was concluded on 3 November 1918 and was to come into effect 36 hours later, during which time thousands of Imperial troops were captured while believing themselves to be at peace, due to poor communication from Army High Command.\n\nEnd of the war\nDuring the night of 2–3 November 1918, the Emperor relinquished command of the armed forces. In a handwritten note which can still be found in the Vienna war archives, he wrote:\n\nNot wanting responsibility for handling the armistice, Arz declined the appointment, and Kövess took up appointment as commander-in-chief instead. Arz however undertook the position de facto until Field Marshal Kövess could take up his office.\n\nAfter the war\n\nAfter the collapse, Arz moved to in Vienna. He was granted a civil list pension of 20 000 Krone, but because of the growing inflation and anyway being not wealthy he had soon a very bad financial situation. Moreover, he became a scapegoat by the public opinion since next to the resigned King the Chief of the General Staff was made responsible for the consequences of the armistice and the defeat of the Battle of Piave. The newly established First Austrian Republic in spite of a new law accepted on 19 December 1918 conducted an infringement procedure against him regarding the Battle of Piave, however it ended without any result.\n\nWith Transylvania and the Bukovina awarded to Romania after the war, he became a Romanian citizen but he refused to return to his home in a country in the defeat of which he had played a significant role only a few years earlier, having expected of possible retaliation. Despite, since January 1921 the Romanian state granted his pension until 1923 when because of the intervention of Ion I. C. Brătianu the Romanian legislation voted a new law which denied the pension to those former Imperial and Royal military personnel officially resident in Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina who were not living in Romania.\n\nAs living in poverty, he applied - as well in the name of 72 fellow officer - to the Hungarian Prime István Bethlen, who denied his submission. He survived on stipends from a support fund organized by former Imperial and Royal comrades to help officers in such situations. In 1924 he was publishing his memoirs. In 1926, the Hungarian Government granted him a pension - ex post facto from 1 November 1925 -, after this the former support fund was transformed to the \"Funds of the former General Staff\". Since 1931, the Hungarian Parliament put a condition to all pensioner to be habitually residing in Budapest, in 1932, he moved officially to the city, however he did not check out from Vienna and continued to stay there recurrently.\n\nHe applied and was granted Hungarian citizenship in 1933. In 1935, Arz wrote of his experiences during the war. His work, unlike those of many of his contemporaries, contained no element of self-justification or political statement.\n\nOn 1 July 1935, during a visit to Budapest to collect his pension, he suffered a heart attack and died. He was buried with the highest military honours at the Kerepesi cemetery in Budapest.\n\nService record\n May 1902 – Promoted to Oberst\n May 1903 – Chairman of the Management Bureau until November 1908\n November 1908 – Promoted to Generalmajor\n November 1908 – Commands 61st Infantry Brigade until April 1912\n April 1912 – Commands 15th Infantry Division until April 1913\n May 1912 – Promoted to Feldmarschalleutnant\n April 1913 – Section chief of all military Departments in the War Ministry until September 1914\n September 1914 – Commands 15th Infantry Division until end of the month\n September 1914 – Commands VI Corps until August 1916\n September 1915 – Promoted to General der Infanterie\n August 1916 – Commands 1st Army until February 1917\n March 1917 – Chief of the General Staff until November 1918\n February 1918 – Promoted to Generaloberst\n\nAwards\n Arz received a number of awards from the Habsburg Monarchy, including, most importantly, appointment to the grade of Commander of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.

He began his military service as a cadet in 1875, rising through the ranks to become General in 1916. His accomplishments during the war are impressive: he was the commander of the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army during the successful Battle of Gorlice-Tarnow. Under his leadership, the army pushed the Russians back, securing the Galician oil fields and forcing the Russians to abandon their defenses in Poland. As a result of his contributions to the war effort, he was awarded the title of Count. However, his reputation was tarnished due to his participation in the military occupation of Serbia, which was known for its atrocities, including mass killings. After the war, Arz von Straußenburg served briefly as Chancellor of Austria in 1919, but was removed from the position after only one day due to his association with the failed Far Right coup attempt known as the Kapp Putsch in Germany. Despite his controversial past, Arz von Straußenburg was considered a talented military strategist, earning him a place in history as one of the foremost leaders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the First World War. Arthur Arz von Straußenburg died on 5 December 1935 in Vienna, Austria, at the age of 78. His legacy lives on as both a symbol of Austro-Hungarian military might during the First World War and a reminder of the dangers of militarism and far-right political ideology.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10689184}

He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he was succeeded by his wife, Wilhelmina Lewellen who served until 2010. John Lewellen is the only Arkansas official to have been elected and represented his district on the city, county and state level.\n\nJohn Marshall Lewellen was born September 16, 1930 in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He was the 11th of 13 children born to Cornelius and Jesse Lewellen. He attended Dansby Elementary School and  professed a hope in Christ at an early age at Taylor Chapel which was named after his grandfather, Taylor Dansby. \nHe graduated from Lincoln High School in Forrest City and served in the U.S. Air Force 1951-1955 during the Korean War. \n \nThe first of his family to attend college, John attended Arkansas AM&N (now UAPB) where he met Wilhelmina Epps.  They were married on November 25, 1956.  Their first daughter, Ivie Rochelle, was born while they pursued and completed their college education. \n \nAfter graduating from AM&N in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, John Lewellen and his family moved to the Altheimer/Hermitage area, where he worked as a high school teacher and principal.  The family moved to Little Rock after the birth of their second daughter, Cornelia Ann, where John began his 30-year career in state government as a state probation officer, state rehabilitation counselor and later as a contractor officer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.\n\nOver the past 54 years, John Lewellen was a highly respected member of the Little Rock community and his neighborhood.  He gave back to the community by buying and rehabbing apartments and homes, ultimately purchasing a senior citizen apartment building, which he named ConIvie Gardens, after his two daughters.  He co-founded the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, one of the strongest neighborhood groups in the city.  To many, he was \"Mr. Lew,\" the \"go-to guy\" for advice and guidance, and a mentor to youths, especially young men.  Many would spend Saturdays with him doing yard work, washing cars, or repairs at his rental properties, while he taught them the importance of a strong work ethic and being a strong black man.\n\nJohn Lewellen wanted to do even more for the community and decided to run for public office.  He was elected to the Little Rock City Board in 1991 and the Pulaski County Quorum Court in 1996.  In 1999, he was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives and represented District 34 for six years.  During his tenure he co-founded the Democratic Black Caucus, chaired the Children and Youth subcommittee, and worked for growth of minority- and women-owned businesses among other issues.  He was the primary and lead sponsor of House Bill 1923 - AN ACT TO CREATE THE MOSAIC TEMPLARS OF AMERICA CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.  This legislation generated more than $5 million for restoring the Mosaic Templars Culture Center, a museum of the Dept. of Arkansas Heritage that houses the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame as well as a collection of African American artifacts.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paul Nietsche\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Paul Nietsche (17 June 1885 – 4 October 1950) was a Ukrainian artist and teacher who emigrated to Ulster in 1936.\n\nEarly life \nPaul Felix Franz Nietsche was born to German parents in Kiev in the Ukraine on 17June 1885. At the age of six his family moved to Odessa where his father established a lithographic printing firm. His artistic talents were encouraged by his Mother from a young age. Nietsche's Mother was said to have pawned his brother's coat on one occasion to buy paints for him.\n\nNietsche studied art at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Odessa under Gennadiy Ladyzhensky and Kiriak Kostandi. In 1908 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. Nietsche then moved to Paris where he befriended the sculptor Auguste Rodin and showed at the Salon of 1912. Nietsche returned to Odessa in 1914 where he remained until the end of World War I, when he relocated to Berlin to be with his family.\n\nLife and works \nWhilst living in Berlin Nietsche befriended a post-graduate student and later a lecturer in English at the University of Leipzig, the Dubliner Michael O'Brien. When O'Brien moved to Queens University Belfast as a lecturer in Celtic Studies in 1926, Nietsche was invited to visit Belfast where he was to show five paintings with the Ulster Art Club in the same year. Between 1926 and 1934 Nietsche travelled extensively throughout Europe supported through exhibitions and picture sales. He painted outside Dubrovnik in 1928; Avignon, Castlewellan, and Switzerland in 1931; Cornwall and Berlin in 1933; and revisited both Cornwall and the South of France in the following year. Throughout this period he returned several times to Ulster, to the O'Brien's in Belfast and to fellow artist Herbert E Broderick's home in Castlewellan. In Cornwall he stayed with the painter R S Rendle Wood.\n\nIn 1929 Nietsche held an exhibition of paintings at Michael O'Brien's home at 411 Lisburn Road, Belfast. He exhibited just once at the Royal Hibernian Academy, in 1930. In the year that he settled in Northern Ireland Nietsche exhibited at the Brook Street Art Galleries in London in 1934, with a further one man show at Dublin's United Arts Club in June of that year. The London exhibition comprised 28 paintings with the majority being Cornish subjects. Two years later he held a show at the Magee Gallery in Belfast.\n\nIn 1936 Nietsche travelled extensively throughout the US and Canada, and afterwards returned to work in Devon and Cornwall before his onward journey to Belfast. At the invitation of Major R G Heyn, Nietsche's work debuted in Canada in 1936, with an exhibition at the Continental Galleries of Fine Art in Montreal. The show comprised 28 works including landscapes, still-life, flowers and a few self-portraits. Several of the landscapes were local scenes of Georgeville and Lake Memphremagog. Nietsche showed with John Hunter and George MacCann at Belfast's Magee Gallery in 1938, with a further solo display at the same venue in 1939. Nietsche applied to be a British citizen in 1938 from an address at 9 Finaghy Park Central in south Belfast.\n\nDuring World War II Nietsche was interned on the Isle of Man \"with chess-playing intellectuals\", before re-establishing himself on the Belfast art scene by opening an attic studio at 76 Dublin Road in the city where he was to work until the end of his life. In 1943 Nietsche showed alongside Stanley Prosser, Seamus Stoupe, and Newton Penprase in the annual Ulster Arts Club exhibition at the Belfast Municipal Gallery.\n\nArt collector and patron Zoltan Lewinter-Frankl opened an exhibition of Nietsche's flower paintings at Tyrone House on Belfast's Ormeau Avenue in 1945. The exhibition was arranged under the auspices of the Council For the Encouragement of Music and Art with thirty works loaned from local patrons. In 1946 the Council for the Encouragement of Music and Art purchased a painting by Nietsche, in addition to works by other contemporary Ulster artists. Twenty-four of the works from the CEMA collection, including Nietsche's painting, were later presented at their Donegall Place gallery in 1954.\n\nNietsche showed at the CEMA Gallery in Belfast in 1947, 1948, and in 1949. The latter comprised 21 paintings and was opened by his good friend, the Lisburn writer Barbara Hunter, whom along with H E Broderick, had contributed a foreword to the 1947 exhibition. The 1949 exhibition included portraits of the stage actors Robert H McCandless, and James G Devlin and the catalogue contained a foreword by the Odd Man Out writer, FL Green. The reviewer for the Lisburn Standard commented,\"Though small in some ways, it is the finest show Nietsche has had in Belfast, for as the years go by he seems to acquire even greater genius in his art, so that he seems at times to almost improve upon nature, adding his own vitality and sensibility to his lovely studies of flowers and fruit.\"The artist also wrote poetry and short stories. He was fluent in Russian, French, German and English. Nietsche parodied local attitudes to modern art in a 1948 play and in 1949 he contributed one poem, A Vision, to the shortlived Ulster poetry journal Rann established by his old friend Barbara Hunter and Roy McFadden in the previous year. His students included Markey Robinson and Jean Osborne.\n\nThe actor Jack Loudan described Nietsche's charitable nature in 1972, in repairing broken dolls, cars and trucks, which he would later distribute to underprivileged children around Castlewellan, County Down. Nietsche's eccentric nature was often cited, and indeed Loudan refers to the alarm experienced by visitors to Nietsche's Dublin Road studio where he fed and entertained with a mouse that had taken up residence there. Nietsche's portrait of Loudan can be viewed in the collection of the National Museums of Northern Ireland. Nietsche's eccentricities extended to his studio where the poet Roy McFadden says he \"flaunted a huge ceramic penis on the wall\". His home and studio were open house to visitors from members of Belfasts artistic and theatrical world, whom Nietsche would entertain with coffee and conversation whilst he continued working. He rose late in the day and worked long into the night, often retiring just before sunrise. He spent some time in Belfast City Hospital in June 1948 and later convalesced at the Crawfordsburn Inn as a guest of a friend. He never fully recovered from this illness and suffered from ill-health until his death.\n\nArtistic style \nDr S B Kennedy described Nietsche's style in 1991, \"His style was based on careful observation of the world around him. Nietsche was a fine colourist. He was at his best when painting still lifes [...] flowers and portraits [...] His landscapes by comparison are less successful, the compositions often lacking resolution while the colours are occasionally muddied and less boldly stated than in his other works. Perhaps the intimacy of a portrait or the exuberance of a group of flowers suited his temperament more than the panorama of landscape.\"Dr Sarah Finlay, writing of his work in the National Self-Portrait Collection of Ireland, described his working methods,\"He worked slowly, taking up to fifteen or more sittings of one or two hours to complete each portrait. Landscapes, still lifes and flower studies make up the rest of his subject-matter. His landscapes tend to be dark, his still lifes and flower paintings more colourful. His style is loose and his line assured. The emphasis on form, in the still lifes in particular indicates the influence of Cézanne, whose work he saw and admired when living in Paris between 1912 and 1914.\"\n\nDeath and legacy \nPaul Nietsche died in Belfast City Hospital on 4 October 1950, after falling ill at his studio four days earlier whilst preparing work for exhibition in London and Dublin. He was unmarried and had no children. Nietsche was survived by three brothers.\n\nA short funeral service was held at All Souls Church on Elmwood Avenue, before his remains were interred at Belfast City Cemetery. Amongst the mourners were Zoltan and Anny Frankl, Jack Loudan of CEMA, Professor J L Montrose of Queen's University, and Joseph Tomelty and R H McCandless of the Group Theatre. Amongst the artists present were William Conor, William R Gordon, Fred Hull, Herbert E Broderick, John Lyness and William Minshull.\n\nHis friends organised a memorial exhibition of his works in the Ulster Farmers' Union Hall in Belfast in 1952 for which Nietsche's brother Eugene made his first visit to Belfast. Jack Loudan opened the exhibition and expressed his desire to see Nietsche commanding his own section in the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland held a retrospective at the Arts Council Gallery in Belfast in 1984.\n\nHis works can be seen in many public and private collections including the Ulster Museum, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the National Self-Portrait Collection of Ireland.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Works of Paul Nietsche in private collections via Rosss.com\n Paul Nietsche's work in the collection of the Ulster Museum via Artuk.org\n\n1885 births\n1950 deaths\n20th-century male artists from Northern Ireland\nPainters from Northern Ireland\nIrish male artists\nIrish male painters\n20th-century Irish painters\n20th-century Ukrainian painters\nImperial Academy of Arts alumni\nUkrainian male painters\n20th-century Ukrainian male artists", "machine_text": "Paul Nietsche (born December 13, 1976) is a Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist.

One etymological derivation of the name is because the northeast trade winds come to this part of the island of Trinidad before reaching any other part of colonial Port of Spain – hence the metaphorical name La Ventaille (\"The Vent\"). Geographically, it is the source of Orographic precipitation for the capital city.\n\nArts and culture\nLaventille is the place where steel pan was born, and it is the birthplace of innovators and world-renowned tuners like the late Rudolph Charles, Bertie Marshall and Roland Harrigin.  It is the heart of the steelpan world, where pioneer Winston \"Spree\" Simon lived and created one of the century’s new acoustical musical instruments. It is home to Desperadoes Steel Orchestra, one of the world's oldest steelbands, still in existence today. It also houses several other bands such as Laventille Hilanders, Courts Laventille Sound Specialists, Tokyo, etc.\n\nLaventille is also the birthplace of many people including Soca artist Destra Garcia. Laventille is probably the oldest Community in East Port of Spain. It has been said, whenever the enslaved peoples escaped from man's inhumanity to man, they headed to the Hills of Laventille.\n\nThe name has also been used as a general term for the neighbourhoods of eastern Port of Spain, including not only Laventille \"proper\" (Success Village, Trou Macaque, Never Dirty) but also East Dry River,Saint Joseph Road, Saint Paul Street, Piccadilly Street, Hill View/Block 8, Beverly Hills, Canada, Afrika, South Quay, Parsley Street, Picton, Plaisance Road, Essex Road, Lodge Place, San Juan, Success, Pump Trace, Sogren Trace, annisette Street, Bath Place, Foster Road, Eastern Main Road, Rock City, Dan Kelly, John-John, Sea Lots, Beetham Estate Gardens, Caledonia, Maryland, Mon Repos and Chinapoo.\n\nEvents\n\nCoopers trained at Angostura\nIn 2015, over a three week period young persons were trained in the art of coopering at Angostura. This training involved the making of barrels from scratch. These barrel which can be used to store the \"work in progress of rum\" are an intrinsic part of the creation of the rum product.\n\nEconomy\nThe world famous Angostura Bitters is currently produced at the Angostura compound which is located off the Eastern Main Road in Laventille. This product is one of the older products of Trinidad and Tobago which has won many awards and which has been exported to many countries. The bitters forms an essential element in many drinks and dishes.\n\nMany of the rums which are produced in Trinidad are made at the Angostura Compound. These rums are exported to many countries and earn valuable foreign exchange for the country. These rums are also used in ponche a creme, the local equivalent of egg nog.\n\nFor many years, MacFoods Meat processors was one of the larger employers in the area, as their factory produced top quality pork hams, marketed under the label \"Blue Ribbon\" hams.\n\nPlaces of interest\n\nAngostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection\n\nThe Angostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection are located in the Angostura compound, Eastern Main Road, Laventille.

It is one of the most densely populated areas in Trinidad and Tobago, with a population of over 12,000 people. The area is known for being a low-income neighborhood with a high crime rate, but it is also known for its vibrant culture and its people's resilience. The history of Laventille dates back to the 17th century when British colonizers arrived in Trinidad. The area was originally settled by freed slaves who had been brought to the island to work on sugar plantations. Over the years, Laventille grew to become a bustling hub of activity, with many small businesses, schools, churches, and community centers. Despite its rich cultural heritage, Laventille has faced many challenges throughout its history. Poverty, unemployment, and high crime rates have plagued the area for decades. However, the people of Laventille have remained resilient in the face of adversity, and have worked tirelessly to improve their community. In recent years, there have been several initiatives aimed at revitalizing the Laventille area. Local organizations and government agencies have worked together to provide job training, educational opportunities, and other resources to residents. These efforts have helped to improve the lives of many people living in Laventille, and have also brought hope and optimism to the community as a whole.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ars Electronica\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ars Electronica Linz GmbH is an Austrian cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of new media art, founded in Linz in 1979. It is based at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC), which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of Linz. Ars Electronica's activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts R&D facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the Prix Ars Electronica awards.\n\nHistory\n\nArs Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, Hubert Bognermayr, Herbert W. Franke, and Ulrich Rützel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz GmbH was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodeled in 2009.\n\nFunding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. Since 2014, the organization has been headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nThe top of the AEC is called the Sky Media Loft, which is mainly used as a coffee house or bar of the museum. It can also be rented out for meetings or events. The bar has occasionally been used as the studio for the newscast of the local TV branch of the Austrian national TV organization ORF. The specialty of the Sky Media Loft is the marvelous view over the Nibelungenbrücke and the main place of Linz at the other side of the Danube which functions as background of the newscasts.\n\nThe second floor is where people can interact with exhibits. There are Musicbottles containing different types of music or Pingpongplus which is a table tennis game on a desk with virtual water on its surface.\n\nThe first floor has displays about the world that had been hidden from our eyes. In the \"Hidden Worlds\" various machines are translating voice and words into virtual symbols or colors and everyday life articles can be moved on a screen if they are touched.\n\nThe little room between the first and the ground floor one of the main attractions is offered. The flight simulator \"Humphrey\" uses virtual reality goggles to give users a simulated view of the flight and the person taking the trip is connected to the computer by cables fixed all over the body. It is possible to fly everywhere and to see the movements of the hands, feet, and the landscape if the visitor raises the head or looks down.\n\nThe entrance or the so-called \"Login Gateway\" of the museum is on the ground floor and leads the newcomer directly to the Telegarden, where a robot is looking after a flower patch. Every ticket is provided with a bar code that gives information about the time the visitor entered the museum. After the visit, the ticket can be put into a computer near the exit and it gives statistic information about the things that happened in the world during the span of the stay in the AEC. The list that is printed out gives information about how many people died or were born during that time or how many accidents have been caused by drunken drivers.\n\nThe last floor is called Virtual Reality and it can be found in the basement of the building. The CAVE is another attraction of the museum. The cube with 3 meters side length is used as a screen to project the virtual world. There are always groups of about 10 that dive into a world where physical laws do not have any meaning. Additionally, the 3D spectacles give the impression of a bodyful environment.\n\nMuseum 2009–present\nThe new Ars Electronica Center, which was designed by Treusch architecture ZT GmbH, opened its doors on 2 January 2009 after roughly two years of construction work and an approximate cost of 30 million euros. It now has 3000 square meters for exhibitions, 100 m2 for research and development, 400 m2 for workshops and conferences, 650 m2 for catering and another 1000 m2 of public space for various types of events.\n\nThe new AEC consists of the original building, a new \"twin-tower\", the main exhibition hall called Main Gallery and the new space for the Ars Electronica Futurelab. The whole building is covered with a 5000-square-meter glass skin that consists of 1100 glass panels. Each panel is equipped with an LED bar that allows it to change its color. Therefore, the whole building acts as a giant display. Artists can create their own visualizations which will be shown on various occasions, especially during the Ars Electronica Festival.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the third floor of the new building and is called CUBUS, referring to the building's cubic shape.\n\nMuseum exhibits \nWith the new building came a new thematic orientation inside of Ars Electronica. Life sciences, global developments (e.g. climate change, population growth, environmental pollution) and the exploration of the universe are just a view of various new topics.\nThe museum can be separated into the following areas:\n\nMain Gallery \nThe Main Gallery with approximately 1000 square meters houses the main exhibition called New Views of Humankind, which focuses on topics like biotechnology, robotics, rapid prototyping and the human body. It is separated into the following four so-called \"labs\":\n\nBrain-Lab focuses on the human brain, perception and advances in medicine.\nBio-Lab focuses on biotechnology and its applications.\nFab-Lab deals with new possibilities offered by 3D printers and rapid prototyping.\nRobo-Lab deals with robotica as well as different prothetic systems.\n\nMain Gallery contains a special area for children which is not thematically connected to the main exhibition.\n\nGeo City \nGeo City focuses on global developments caused by humankind, like growth in population and the extraction of natural resources. Those global developments are connected with possible local reactions, which is visualized in an interactive city information system called Sim-Linz.\n\nArtists, Creators, Engineers \nThis is the area for temporary exhibitions on the first and second floor of the original building and focuses on the interdisciplinary aspects of Ars Electronica and its contributors.\n\nDeep Space \nThe Deep Space is a multifunctional presentation room that offers a wide range of possibilities. It consists of two walls (front and floor) with dimensions of 16 × 9 meters which serve as screens for eight Galaxy NH-12 projectors by Barco. The projects range from high-resolution videos to scientific (3D) visualizations like a flight out from the solar system to the whole known universe and artistic projects.\n\nFutureLab \nThe same building holds the Ars Electronica FutureLab, a place for researching and trying out new cyberarts technologies.  See also the Prix Ars Electronica, a yearly award ceremony given out by Ars Electronica at their cyberarts festival.  Since 2004, one of the awards at the Prix Ars Electronica brings a young innovator or team of innovators to the FutureLab for a summer to develop a budding idea or technology in electronic media.\n\nFestival\n\nThe annual Ars Electronica Festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as \"a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention\". The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.\n\nEach year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, had as its theme \"C... What it Takes to Change\", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.\n\nFeatures at the 2014 festival\n\nDevice art\n\nA form of concept art, device art has been described as \"a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different\". Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:\n \"Otamatone\" – a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.\n \"Food Simulator\", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.\n \"Lenticular Bicycle\" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as \"Sustainable Cinema No. 2\" and created by Scott Hessels.\n A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.\n \"Touchy\", a \"human camera\", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.\n\nSmart atoms (spaxels)\nA version called \"Smart atoms: spaxels version\" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival.\n\nPrix Ars Electronica\n\nThe Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, \"honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media\". Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation. Grover (2008) has described the top-ranking award, the Golden Nica, as \"the Oscar of digital art\".\n\nThe prize was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014, there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries. All entries remain on display in an online archive, the Prix Ars Electronica Showcase, containing over 55,000 items.\n\nAward categories\nAwards of the Golden Nica (worth 10,000 euros), Awards of Distinction, and Honorary Mentions are made in the following categories:\n Computer animation / Film / VFX (First presented in 1987)\n U19 Create Your World (First presented in 1998)\n Visionary Pioneers of Media Art\n Interactive Art\n Digital Music & Sound Art\n Hybrid Art (First presented in 2007)\n Digital Communities (First presented in 2004)\n Artificial Intelligence & Life Art (First presented in 2019)\nNote: \n\nThere is also a grant scheme to honor and support ideas of exceptional promise.

He describes the institute's activities as \"a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society\". Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as \"beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology\". Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the Modernist call for \"art for art's sake\".\n\nGrover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica \"will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society\".\n\nPublications\nGrover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as \"a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact.\"\n\n Cyberarts 98: .net, Interactive Art, Computer Animation/Visual Effects, Computer Music, U19/Cybergeneration.

Treviranus attended the University of Göttingen, where he studied medicine under the guidance of some of the most distinguished scholars of his time. He received his doctorate in 1802, and went on to work as a physician in Bremen and Altona. However, his interest in botany soon began to dominate his attention, and he began publishing articles on topics ranging from plant anatomy to the role of plants in the environment. In 1806, Treviranus became a professor of botany at the University of Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), where he remained for the rest of his career. His scientific achievements during this period were numerous and impressive. He was a pioneer in the field of plant physiology, and his studies on the absorption of water and minerals by plants helped to establish the concept of osmosis. He was also one of the first scientists to recognize the importance of ecological factors in shaping plant growth and development. Treviranus was highly respected by his peers, and his work had a profound influence on the development of biology in the 19th century. His publications on plant physiology and ecology were widely read and cited, and his ideas helped to shape the scientific debate on these topics for many years to come.

Following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, which ended in Austrian defeat, Schleswig and Holstein were annexed by decree of the King of Prussia on 12 January 1867. The province was created in 1868, and it incorporated the Duchy of Lauenburg from 1876 onward.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I, the Allied powers organised two plebiscites in Northern and Central Schleswig on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. In Northern Schleswig, 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% for staying with Germany. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed, with 80% voting for Germany and 20% for Denmark. No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig, as it was considered a foregone conclusion that almost all the inhabitants would vote to remain in Germany.\n\nOn 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig was officially reunited with Denmark (see: South Jutland County). The remainder of Schleswig remained part of Schleswig-Holstein, now a province of the Free State of Prussia.\n\nWith the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and the Oldenburgian exclave Region of Lübeck were incorporated into the Schleswig-Holstein province, while a number of Hamburg's adjacent municipalities, among them the city districts of Altona and Wandsbek, were incorporated into the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. This again ceded its exclaves of Geesthacht and Großhansdorf to Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nAfter World War II, Schleswig-Holstein was part of the British occupation zone, although some municipalities of Schleswig-Holstein east of Ratzeburg were exchanged for municipalities of Mecklenburg in the Soviet occupation zone (Barber Lyashchenko Agreement).

The province had an area of 15,764 square kilometers and a population of around 2 million. The establishment of the province of Schleswig-Holstein was part of the reorganization of Germany by the Prussian government after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The province was created by merging the two Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, which had been under Austrian and Prussian administration respectively since 1864. The province was initially organized into three administrative districts: Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg. Schleswig-Holstein was a predominantly agricultural province, with a significant fishing industry in its coastal regions. The province was also home to several important ports, including Kiel and Flensburg. The economy of the province developed rapidly in the early 20th century, with the growth of manufacturing industries and the expansion of the Kiel Canal, which connected the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. During World War II, Schleswig-Holstein was heavily bombed by Allied forces, with many of its towns and cities suffering significant damage. After the war, the province became part of the newly established state of Schleswig-Holstein, which was created by the British military administration in 1946. The new state had a similar territorial scope to the former province, but with additional territories in the south that had previously been part of the state of Hamburg. Today, the state of Schleswig-Holstein is one of the 16 states of Germany and has a population of around 2.8 million. It is known for its coastal beaches, historic towns, and vibrant cultural scene.

The asteroid has an eccentric orbit, which means that it follows an elliptical path, bringing it closer and farther away from the Sun at different times. Several observations of 4045 Lowengrub have been carried out by astronomers. In 2007, stellar occultation observations suggested that the asteroid has an elongated shape, with a long axis of about 16 km and a short axis of about 10 km. This was confirmed by observations carried out at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands in 2008. The origin and composition of 4045 Lowengrub are still unknown, but it is believed to be a primitive asteroid, meaning it has remained mostly unchanged since its formation. This makes it an interesting target for future space missions, as it could provide valuable insight into the early Solar System.

The drama features Francis Lederer, Sigrid Gurie and J. Edward Bromberg.\n\nPlot\nJan Foley (Lederer), an amnesiac Czech pianist, is a victim of Nazi torture for playing a banned song. Living under a new identity on the island of French-governed Guadalupe, Jan tries to recall his past life while working for refugee smuggler Angelo (Alexander Granach).\n\nTo the melancholy island of Guadalupe come a band of refugees, stripped of their friends and their country by the war. Among them dwells a brooding, sinister man known only as \"El Hombre,\" whose memory was destroyed by the brutality of the Nazis. One evening, as El Hombre sits trance-like at the piano and plays a somber melody, his music drifts into the room inhabited by other refugees, Dr. Hoffman, his wife Anna, and their invalid charge, Marya Volny. El Hombre's playing reminds Anna of Jan Volny, a famous pianist from her homeland of Czechoslovakia, and she bitterly reflects upon the life that they lost.\n\nAfter finishing the piece, El Hombre reads a notice from the governor, warning refugees about \"murder boats\" that will promise them asylum in the U.S., but will leave them to perish at sea after fleecing them of their savings. The demented El Hombre takes the warning as a sign to destroy the fishing boat owned by his compassionate employer Angelo. El Hombre's act infuriates Angelo's cruel brothers, Luigi and Marco, who loathe the stranger and wish him dead.\n\nAs Marya's condition worsens, Anna blames herself for forcing the girl to leave her homeland and recalls the conditions that drove them into exile: After invading Prague, the Nazis grant permission to Czech pianist Jan Volny to present a concert. They stipulate, however, that \"The Moldau,\" a much-loved patriotic symphony written by Bedrich Smetana, be excluded from the concert. Carried away by the beauty of the music, Volny ends his concert with a four-minute paraphrase of the famed symphony. Realizing that his act will draw the wrath of the Nazis and that his wife, Marya, will also suffer at the hands of their oppressors, Volny arranges for the Hoffmans to smuggle her out of the country, but before he can escape himself, he is captured and subjected to unspeakable violence, which deranges him.\n\nEn route to a concentration camp, Volny overpowers his guards and escapes. After making his way to Lisbon, he hides on a fishing boat owned by Angelo and his brothers, which embarks shortly thereafter and carries him to the island of Guadalupe. In the fog of his unhinged brain, Volny fails to remember his own name and identity, and is thus dubbed El Hombre. As Anna's thoughts return to the present, Marya, enchanted by the sound of El Hombre's piano, rises from her bed, inches her way down the stairs and then collapses in the street. El Hombre finds her there, and as he fingers the crucifix encircling her neck, his memory begins to return.\n\nWhen the Hoffmans come looking for Marya, El Hombre retreats into the shadows. He begins to recall snatches of his life with Marya, but his reverie is cruelly interrupted by Luigi's harsh voice challenging him. Angelo hears shots and finds Luigi, gun in hand, standing over El Hombre's body. As the brothers argue, Luigi stabs Angelo with an ice pick. Noticing that El Hombre has vanished, the wounded Angelo follows a trail of blood up the stairs to Marya's room, where the Hoffmans are notifying the police of Marya's death. At her bedside, El Hombre cradles Marya's lifeless body in his arms, begging her to return to life. His entreaties echo the words spoken to him by Marya at the time of their separation in Czechoslovakia, affirming her certainty that he will one day come for her.\n\nCast\n Francis Lederer as Jan Volny\n Sigrid Gurie as Marya\n J.

The magazine was launched in 1980 by Barry Cain and Tim Lott, with the aim of showcasing new and upcoming bands from the post-punk and new wave movements. The first issue featured an interview with Joy Division, as well as coverage of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ultravox, and other emerging acts. In 1982, Flexipop launched its own record label, which released a series of 7-inch singles featuring exclusive tracks by some of the most exciting bands of the era. These included Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, The Human League, and Altered Images, as well as lesser-known acts such as The Rivals and The Vapors. Each single came with a Flexipop magazine featuring interviews, reviews, and photographs, as well as a flexidisc featuring bonus tracks and other exclusive content. Flexipop was known for its irreverent and often controversial approach to music journalism. The magazine featured provocative articles, interviews with unusual subjects, and a distinctive punk-inspired graphic design. The record label similarly pushed boundaries, releasing singles with provocative artwork and provocative lyrics. Despite its popularity among music fans, Flexipop only lasted a few years. The magazine folded in 1983, and the record label stopped releasing new records soon after. However, Flexipop's influence can still be seen in the vibrant and diverse British music scene of the early 1980s, and the label's releases remain highly sought-after by collectors and fans of post-punk and new wave.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13099381}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Conomurex luhuanus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Conomurex luhuanus, common name Strawberry conch or Tiger conch, is a species of medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Strombidae, the true conchs. C. luhuanus is found in sandy habitat among corals in the Indopacific region.  They feed on algae or detritus, move with a modified foot, and have complex eyes compared to other gastropods.\n\nShell description \n\nThe shell of C. luhuanus ranges from a more common length of 5 cm, to a maximum length of 8 cm.\n\nC. luhuanus is often mistaken for a cone snail, mainly because of the conoidal outline of its shell, which is relatively unusual among the Strombidae. Its stromboid notch, though not as conspicuous as observed in many species that used to belong to  Strombus (such as Lentigo lentiginosus), is deep and easily distinguished. The interior may be slightly lirate.\n\nThe external color of the shell can be either white with an orange, brown/tan pattern of blotches, or completely brown/white. The interior is usually colored strong orange, red or pink, and the inner lip border is black or chocolate brown.\n\nPhylogeny\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae have been mainly accessed on two occasions, by Simone (2005) and Latiolais (2006), using two distinct methods. Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae, which included C. luhuanus.\n\nWith the exception of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated within the genus Strombus, including C. luhuanus. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and theirmost recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis. The genus Conomurex, in this case, only included C. luhuanus.\n\nIn a different approach, Latiolais et al. (2006) proposed a cladogram based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene showing phylogenetic relationships of 32 species that used to belong to the genus Strombus and Lambis, including Conomurex luhuanus (= Strombus luhuanus). All species in this cladogram are still given under their original names in Strombus and Lambis.\n\n Habitat and ecology \nC. luhuanus dwells in sandy substrate in tropical habitats, such as the Great Barrier Reef and southern Papua New Guinea. They often form colonies that move together over long periods of time. Two types of colonies have been described: colonies of juveniles that are made up of conch of the same size-class, and colonies of mixed age-classes that contain individual conch of a spectrum of ages, although within the colony separation based on age still persists. C. luhuanus are herbivores or feed on detritus. They use their proboscis to pick up sand which they may then swallow or eat algae from. Strombus also have sensory tentacles at the end of their eyestalks which may play a role in chemically sensing the presence of nearby food. The sensory tentacles may also be important in detecting predators, such as carnivorous snails. Unlike many snails that move by slowly creeping along their terrain, members of the Strombus family move with an awkward leaping motion as they thrust off the sea floor with their modified foot. This leaping motion is also used to quickly escape from predators.\n\n Reproduction \nC. luhuanus form mating aggregations of copulating individuals were males and females compete for reproduction opportunities.\n\n Vision \nThe eyes of members of the Strombus family are positioned at the ends of eye stalks and typically have a diameter of about 1.5-2.5 mm, which is large compared to their body size. The eye stalks extend from two notches in the shell. The eye of Strombus contains a spherical lens, a cornea, a pupil with a pigmented iris surrounding it, a vitreous body, and a cup-shaped retina. In contrast, some other gastropods only possess small open eyes containing a gelatinous substance. The retina is made up of several layers. The first layer, located adjacent to the vitreous body, is primarily composed of the processes of photoreceptor cells. This layer is approximately 180 um thick. The next layer is characterized by an abundance of dark pigment granules. The following layer contains the cell bodies of different cell types, and the last layer consists of neuropil. It is from the neuropil layer that the optic nerve projects in several small branches that eventually merge to form a single nerve fiber. Strombus has almost 100,000 photoreceptors, whereas some nudibranchs merely have five. Three distinct cell types have been described in the retinas of C. luhuanus, one of which is a photoreceptor, another which is a glial cell, and the last which may be a second type of photoreceptor.  Only one type of visual pigment has been identified in C. luhuanus, suggesting that they do not possess color vision.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings that measure electrical impulses, or action potentials, from neurons have been used to study the neural processing of visual information from the eye of C. luhuanus. When eyes adapted to the dark were shown brief flashes of light, a cornea-negative potential was evoked. This response was termed the \"on\" response. When light was presented to the dark-adapted eye for a longer period of time, the extracellular retinal potential (ERG) recordings showed the cornea-negative potential declined until a steady-state was reached. Then, the steady-state was maintained until the light stimulus ceased and the potential returned to baseline. Finally, a third type of response that fired at the cessation of light stimulus was observed and termed the \"off\" response. These different waveform responses could indicate that C. luhuanus is capable of complex neural processing involving excitation, inhibition, and synaptic inhibition. The \"on\" response could be due to excitation of the optic nerve in response to depolarizing photoreceptors, while the decline to steady-state potential could be a sign of synaptic inhibition, and the \"off\" activity could indicate release from light-promoted inhibition.\n\nThe light-promoted \"off\" potentials were found to be sensitive to anesthesia by magnesium chloride, with repetitive \"off\" potentials eliminated within minutes of being introduced to the magnesium chloride solution. However, the light-promoted \"on\" potentials were not affected by the magnesium chloride and would continue firing over an hour after being immersed in the magnesium chloride solution. These results could indicate that nerve fibers that are responsible for \"off\" stimuli are regulated by chemical synapses, which can be inhibited by magnesium.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why C. luhuanus evolved such well-developed eyes. Usually eyes of this complexity are found on predators that move quickly through their environment looking for prey, not in slow-moving herbivorous creatures such as C. luhuanus. One study suggests that the eyes are important for coordination in the escape response of Strombus. When conch were blinded, they showed an increased probability of leaping nearer to the predator instead of away from it. More work remains to be done on the purpose of the eyes, however.\n\n Regeneration \nAnother remarkable feature of the eyes of Strombus luhuanus is that they are capable of regeneration following amputation. The first step of regeneration following severance of the optic nerve is the formation of an eye cup as the epithelium adjacent to the cut folds inward. This occurs within a day after the optic nerve is cut. The eye cup is closed by day three, and at this stage it resembles an embryonic eye. The diameter of the eye continues to increase, and meanwhile the cells of the eye differentiate to form the different layers in the retina. When the diameter of the eye reaches about 0.8 mm (after about 15 days), the retina looks like a mature adult eye. The eye will continue to grow until it becomes fully sized, with a diameter of 2 mm, which can take several months. Size, age, sex, nutritional state, or whether the left or right eye is amputated does not have a substantial influence on the regenerative prospects of the eye.\n\nIn gastropod eye regeneration, the degenerating nerve is important for the formation of the new eye. New axons leave the eye cup and bundle together to form the optic nerve. The new nerve fibers seem to be attracted to the previous optic nerve, and grow down it until they make contact with the cerebral ganglion.\n\nElectroretinograms (ERGs) have been used to monitor neuron activity in the developing eye of C. luhuanus over the course of the eye's development. The ERGs of the regenerating C. luhuanus eye grow increasingly complex as the eye matures. During the first week of regeneration, a simple \"on\" peak was recorded, and steady-state potentials were observed in response to prolonged illumination. When the eye reached about 0.4 mm in diameter, an \"off\" response was observed occasionally. At a diameter of 0.6 mm, rhythmic ERG \"off\" responses were detected. By 0.8 mm in diameter, the ERGs of the regenerated eye resembled that of a mature adult eye, with two distinct cornea-negative \"on\" potentials and rhythmic \"off\" potentials.\n\nReferences \n\n Walls, J.G.

The Conomurex luhuanus has an elongated shell that measures 7-10 cm in length and 3-4 cm in width. Its shell is sturdy and cone-shaped with a pointed end, and the color varies from pale to white. The ridges running along the surface of the shell are noticeable, and it has spines on the shoulder of the last whorl. This species lives in shallow marine environments ranging from intertidal to subtidal zones. They usually dwell on rocky reefs and sandy bottoms. They also inhabit seagrass beds and coral reefs, where they feed on other mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. The Conomurex luhuanus plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a predator and prey to other organisms. It is also considered a delicacy in the Philippines, where it is commonly consumed and sold fresh or pickled in vinegar and spices. Unfortunately, the Conomurex luhuanus population has reduced in numbers due to overfishing and depletion of their natural habitats. In response, the Philippine government has implemented laws and regulations to protect this species and its environment.

The members of 3 Reconnaissance Commando were diverse and came from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The unit was known for its expertise in conducting reconnaissance missions deep behind enemy lines, as well as for its proficiency in unconventional warfare. Members of the unit were involved in a number of covert operations, including sabotage missions and assassinations. One of the most infamous operations carried out by the unit was in 1985 during the Angola Civil War. Members of 3 Reconnaissance Commando, along with members of other Special Forces units, carried out a raid on the SWAPO rebel headquarters in Angola's capital, Luanda. The mission resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people, including civilians. South Africa's transition to democracy in the early 1990s saw the disbandment of 3 Reconnaissance Commando and other special forces units. Many of the former members of the unit were incorporated into South Africa's new military and security structures. The unit's legacy, however, has been a controversial one.

It was translated to English by Antonina W. Bouis in 1985. This is one of the most popular readable novels in Georgia and former Soviet countries. The character is often compared to the English folklore hero Robin Hood .\n\nAbout novel \nThe novel is a story of a Georgian outlaw of the Imperial Russian period, a very popular theme in Georgian literature, and combines thrilling escapades with Dostoevskian dealings with the fate of an individual and national soul. The story is narrated by a Russian gendarme, Count Szeged, who frequently passes the story-telling on to other characters. The novel follows the life of outlaw Data Tutashkhia, who spends years eluding capture by the Tsarist police. They are led by Data's cousin, his detached and imperturbable double, Mushni Zarandia. The book, and the feature film based on it, turned Data Tutaskhia into an iconic hero, widely popular in Georgia.\n\nPlot and structure \nThe novel is divided into four parts chronicling its hero's, Data Tutashkhia's, moral evolution, always narrated from the perspective of a multitude of characters from  Tutashkhia's past. He is a man who from birth, can not stand injustice and wrongdoing. At the very beginning of the novel, we learn that he was convicted of an accidental killing that even the victim absolved him of! This then began his life as a fugitive, constantly running from police desperate to catch him. Throughout the novel, He goes from place to place, sees evil and struggles with how to overcome it. In the first part of the novel,  Tutashkhia attempts to help those wronged with little result, as either the individual wronged (strangely enough) continues to allow him/herself to be wronged (as in the case of the loser at cards continuing to allow himself to be cheated by card sharks); or the injured and insulted, once rescued by Data, start, themselves, to injure and insult (as was the case with the married pair whom  Tutashkhia assisted to purchase a cow). An excellent, memorable tale in this section of the novel was that of the hospital patients, whom he likened to the cannibal rats bred by one of the residents. \n\nIn the second part of the novel Data Tutashkhia, saddened by his previous experiences, decides not to intervene at all in societal issues unless absolutely certain that his actions would bring good. His new stance had the result of people forgetting all of his past good deeds, and turning on him for his 'indifference'. \n\nIn the third part of the novel, Tutashkhia, who has by this point lost his way, attempts to mingle in society in order to determine for himself a meaning and way forward in life. He joins the company of a lawyer and a mysterious woman and their little group engages in various philosophical debates over drinks (which it seems was/is a national pastime in Georgia!). This portion of the story was both interesting, in terms of the philosophical debates, and suspenseful The segment's climax, the dinner at the lawyer's home (with its 'mystery' guest), was particularly suspenseful and well written.\n\nIn the next section of the novel, Data Tutashkhia decides that evil can only be overcome by force. Here, we learn more about his cousin, who by this time, is one of the Russian imperial gendarme's 'best and brightest'. Completely -ahem- 'devoted' to his job and - ahem- ahem- 'unbiased', he zealously oversees a program to rid the region of 'dangerous' outlaws such as his cousin. It is in this section that we truly gain an understanding of which of the brothers really is the danger to society and the regime.\n\nIn the final part of the book,  Tutashkhia finally decides for himself, based on all of his past experiences, that the best way to rid the world of evil is to do good. This section of the novel features a gripping ending, as well as the final confrontation between Data and his family.\n\nExternal links \nNovel on Amazon.com\nNovel's review\nNovel on goodreads.com\n\nReferences \n\n1975 novels\nGeorgian-language works\nNovels by Chabua Amirejibi\nGeorgian novels\nHistorical novels\nPhilosophical novels", "machine_text": "Data Tutashkhia is a Georgian television series that is set in the 17th century.

Feel… is a word of emotion that refers to the sense of touch, emotions, and the sensation of an event or experience. The word is frequently used to elucidate the emotional connections between individuals and the world around them. The term “feel” often connotes a sense of physical touch, such as the way one feels when they touch a rough surface, a soft fabric, or the warm sun on their skin. The sensation of feel can be intensified by an individual’s perception of pressure, temperature, or discomfort. Furthermore, the word “feel” also denotes the emotional responses to external stimuli. For instance, one might feel happy, sad, anxious, or angry in certain situations. These emotional feelings are subjective and can change depending on an individual's experiences and perspectives. In music, the term “feel” is used to describe the emotional intensity of a piece. Musicians strive to evoke feelings in their listeners through the sound and rhythm of their music. In the context of sports, the term “feel” is used to describe an individual's ability to control their movements and connect with the equipment or field. Athletes might refer to their “feel” for the ball or puck in order to describe their ability to move and manipulate their equipment to achieve their goals. Finally, in the world of literature, the term “feel” is used to describe the emotional impact of a particular work. Whether it’s a novel, poem, or play, authors strive to convey their stories in a way that evokes strong feelings in readers. In conclusion, feel is much more than just a sense of touch, but rather a reflection of our emotions and connections with the world around us. It is through the many different experiences that add to our perceptions of the world that we come to understand a sense of \"feel.\"", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 36820956}

On 7 November 1888 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married 33-year-old sheepmaster David Alexander Skene.\n\nCareer\nStraddled in debt, Hamilton's husband had to seek employment in New South Wales, while she and her children remained in Hamilton. In 1900 the family moved to Manly, Sydney, where they ran a modest dairy farm. In 1906, they moved to Melbourne and her husband began selling wool. The family purchased a property in South Yarra in 1910.\n\nUnable to make the second payment on the property he was buying when the banks collapsed in the early 1890s, David was forced to work as a station-manager in New South Wales. Lillias and their children stayed at Hamilton. They rejoined him at Curraweena station, near Bourke, in 1896 before moving to Glenariff and then in 1900 to Manly, Sydney. There they invested in a small dairy and leased 25 acres (10 ha). In the face of drought and the high cost of fodder, they sold out in 1906 and moved to Melbourne, where David set up as a woolbroker and stock-and-station agent. In 1910, with money inherited from her mother, Lillias acquired a house for the family at South Yarra.\n\nSkene was the assistant-secretary of the National Council of Women of Victoria (Victorian NCW).

It belongs to the Calamian Tagbanwa group of languages, which also includes the Calamian Islands Tagbanwa language and the Agutaynen language. Kagayanen language has around 8,000 speakers, mainly in the towns of Coron, Busuanga, and Culion, although it is also spoken in neighboring municipalities. Unlike other indigenous languages in the Philippines, Kagayanen is not written and is primarily an oral language. The language is also characterized by its unique system of vocalism, and use of glottal stops and nasal sounds. In terms of grammar, Kagayanen is an agglutinative language, meaning words are formed by attaching numerous affixes to a root word, giving it a more extensive meaning. Kagayanen also follows a subject-verb-object sentence order like most Austronesian languages. The cultural identity of the Kagayanen people is closely tied to their language, as it reflects their customs, traditions, and way of life. Kagayanen language is used in various aspects of their daily life, from informal conversations to religious rituals and ceremonies. Despite efforts to preserve the language, there is concern that it may eventually disappear due to the influence of the dominant Philippine languages and the lack of formal education materials in Kagayanen. Various initiatives have been put forth by local government units and non-governmental organizations to promote and sustain the use of Kagayanen language, including the development of reading materials, cultural programs, and the inclusion of indigenous language subjects in the school curriculum. In 2017, Kagayanen language was recognized as one of the official languages of the municipality of Culion in recognition of its cultural importance and contribution to the way of life of the Kagayanen people.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7035518}

The first book in the series was The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow which was Waterstones Children's Book of the Month in June 2015.\n\nPlot\nSophie Taylor and Lillian \"Lil\" Rose, the main female protagonists, are quite bored from lack of mysteries to solve and the business of everyday life in Sinclair's. An art exhibition of some of the finest and most renowned work in the country is to be displayed in Sinclair's and one of the focal pieces is the Green Dragon by Benedetto Casselli, the second artwork in the Casselli sequence, a painting which was especially presented to the exhibition by His Majesty the King Edward VII. On the first day of the exhibition, the cloth supposedly covering the Green Dragon is removed and everyone is shocked to see that the original painting has been stolen and the copy painting of an art student at the Spencer Institute for Art, Leonora \"Leo\" Fitzgerald is replaced. Leo is present and insists that she didn't do it, as she disposed of her artwork after a rich art benefactor Mr Raymond Lyle criticised it, saying it did not resemble the original painting whatsoever despite its imaginative flair demonstrated in the artwork. Investigation by Detective Inspector Worth is held and he recruits Billy as his assistant in interviews, to which Billy is quite proud of.

The mystery revolves around a rare and valuable Chinese scroll painting of a dragon that was painted during the Ming dynasty. The painting was believed to have been created by the famous Ming dynasty artist, Wu Wei. It was known for its intricate details, vibrant colors, and remarkable execution of the dragon's every scale and whisker. The painting was also known to have been owned by several wealthy Chinese collectors over the centuries. However, the painting's story takes a strange turn during the 1940s when it disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The painting was last seen in the possession of a wealthy Chinese collector named Chang Chen. Chang was known to be a collector of rare Chinese art and was a notorious hoarder who seldom showed his collection to anyone. Rumors began to circulate that Chang had been killed or kidnapped for the painting. However, no evidence of foul play was ever discovered. The painting remained missing for years until it resurfaced in the 1970s when it was discovered in an antique shop in Hong Kong. The painting's condition had deteriorated, and many people believed that it was a forgery. However, after careful examination, art historians concluded that it was the real deal. The painting was subsequently sold at a private auction for a record-breaking sum of money. The mystery of the Painted Dragon still remains unsolved, and questions about its disappearance and reappearance continue to intrigue collectors, historians, and art enthusiasts. Some people speculate that it was stolen by a rival collector, while others believe that it was hidden away during the Communist takeover of China in 1949. Despite the numerous theories surrounding its disappearance, the Painted Dragon remains a valuable and sought-after work of art that continues to capture the imaginations of people around the world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 51308587}

Following a draw and a defeat in their opening two games, Guus Hiddink resigned as manager on 22 July 2013.\n\nRecently appointed Assistant Coach Rene Meulensteen was then put in charge of the team in a caretaker capacity until 8 August 2013, when Gadzhi Gadzhiyev was appointed as the club's manager for a fifth time.

The season was marked by inactivity in the transfer market due to financial problems. As a result, the club suffered a dismal season, finishing in 16th place and getting relegated to the Russian National Football League. Season Review Anzhi started the season with Guus Hiddink as the manager, but he soon left the club due to financial issues. Gadzhi Gadzhiev took over as the new manager and attempted to turn the fortunes of the team around but was unable to do so. The team was plagued with injuries in the first half of the season, with several key players missing games. Anzhi’s poor form was largely down to their lack of scoring ability, with the team managing to score just 20 goals in 30 games. They only managed to win two games away from home and lost seven of their last eight games of the season. Despite the club's financial difficulties, Anzhi continued to attract top players to the team, with Samuel Eto'o, Lassana Diarra, and Yuri Zhirkov all playing for the club in the 2013-2014 season. However, the high wages paid to these players had a major impact on the club's finances. Despite Anzhi's relegation from the Russian Premier League, there were still some positives to take from the 2013-14 season. Young players such as Magomed Ozdoyev, Arsen Khubulov and Timur Suleymanov were given the chance to play and gain valuable experience, which would prove useful in future seasons. Player Statistics During the 2013-14 season, Samuel Eto'o was the team's top scorer with 8 goals in 17 appearances. Yuri Zhirkov had the most appearances for the team with 27, followed closely by Lassana Diarra with 26 appearances. Conclusion The 2013-14 season was a disappointing one for Anzhi Makhachkala due to their financial problems. With the relegation to the Russian National Football League, the club would have to work harder to regain their place in the Russian Premier League.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 39576252}

In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Café Américain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie  Casablanca.\n\nPlot summary\nCasablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Café Américain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing \"As Time Goes By\"  on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there.\n\nIt all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to  Sydney Greenstreet —the actor who interpreted señor Ferrari— decides to build a replica of Rick's café to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose, he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Señor Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey.\n\nWhen the café is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are “inside” the famous movie. Señor Ferrari's dream (“Ferrari” is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Señor Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true.\n\nSome years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Señor Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Perón to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Perón —who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) — agrees to it.\n\nThe café manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Perón, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the café will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale.\n\nIn the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while, some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by.\n\nTime passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins.\n\nMeanwhile, the storm has subsided.  Sam plays \"As Time Goes By\" once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place.\n\nBackground\nIn 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno, as visiting professor and writer-in-residence for the fall 2002 – spring 2003. As writer-in-residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said:\n\n“I started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said”.\n\nSo, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November–December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe.\n\nMain characters\nSeñor Ferrari A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Señor Ferrari.\n\nSam He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Señor Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella.\n\nRick Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind.\n\nIlsa Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Señor Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and protégée. In the story, Sam calls her “Elsa”.\n\nUgarte Before being hired by Señor Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nFortunato A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick.\n\nThe Narrator Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession.\n\nTheme\n\nThe novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that “Europeans in exile” (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled “Europe”.\n\nThe splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980.\n\nIn the novella, the coup d´état which overthrew President Perón in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca —which had already been “hurt” by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease—. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other “Casablanca”, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when José Félix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hipólito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly.\n\nThe novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life.\n\nTranslation into English\nThe translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.\n\nSee also\n History of Argentina\n\nReferences\n\n The Washington Post: “For the first time in English, the Argentine labyrinths of Edgar Brau”, by Michael Dirda.

The novella tells the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate living in Casablanca during the early days of WWII. The story explores themes of love, sacrifice, and political resistance against Nazi occupation. Casablanca was initially written as an unproduced play called Everybody Comes to Rick's. Burnett and his writing partner, Joan Alison, adapted the play into a novella that was published in the New Yorker in 1941, a few months before the release of the famous movie adaptation. The novella follows Rick’s struggles to reconcile his past with his current life in Casablanca. He runs a nightclub called Rick's Café Américain, which attracts a diverse group of customers, including refugees, Nazis, and French and Belgian resistance fighters. The plot thickens when Ilsa Lund, Rick's former lover, returns to Casablanca with her husband, a key resistance leader, and Rick is forced to choose between his love for Ilsa and the greater cause of defeating the Nazis. The novella received critical acclaim for its vivid portrayal of wartime Casablanca and its complex characters. Burnett's writing style is praised for its wit and vivid imagery, making it a compelling read. The novella's timeless themes and unforgettable characters have made it a staple of American literature. Casablanca the movie, directed by Michael Curtiz, starred Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. The movie went on to win three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and cemented Casablanca's place as an iconic American classic. In summary, Casablanca is a novella that explores the complexities of wartime love and political resistance. With its compelling storyline and unforgettable characters, it is a timeless classic that has captivated readers and viewers for over 70 years.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29485442}

On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Les Avenières-Veyrins-Thuellin.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as Avenièrants or Avenièrantes.\n\nGeography\nLes Avenières lies on the left bank of the Rhône as it loops north some 25 km east by north-east of Bourgoin-Jallieu and 25 km west by north-west of Chambéry. The Rhone river forms the north-eastern border of the commune and is also the border between Isère and Ain departments. Access to the commune is by road D450 from Veyrins-Thuellin in the south-west which goes to the village then continues south-east to Saint-Genix-sur-Guiers. The D33 goes from Morestel in the north-west and passes through the north of the commune and across the Rhône bridge where it becomes the D10 and goes north-east to join the D19. The D40B goes north from the village to join the D33. The D40E connects the  D40 at the eastern edge of the commune to the D40B. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Le Chamolay, Curtille, Le Grand Chaffard, Le Maitre, Le Bessey, Le Sablonnet, and Les Nappes. The commune has a large forest in the north-east on the Île Molettes with a large urban area in the centre mixed with farmland, and in the south mixed forest and farmland.\n\nThe north-western border of the commune consists entirely of a left branch of the Rhône river as it loops north on its course through Lyon south to the Mediterranean. The Grand Canal de l'Huert forms the south-western border of the commune which curves to join the Huert river which is part of the northern border of the commune. The Canal du Champ forms the southern border of the commune where it connects the Grand Canal de l'Huert to the Bièvre river which forms the south-eastern border of the commune flowing north-east to join the Rhône.\n\nNeighbouring communes and villages\n\nToponymy\nThe name Avenières is derived from the Franco-Provençal avena meaning \"oats\".\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\nFrom the late Neolithic to the middle Bronze Age the region was inhabited by farmers. A scythe found in Les Avenières region is preserved in the Vienne Museum. It is the only evidence of human occupation before the Gallo-Romans. It was found at the confluence of the Bièvre and the Rhône.\n\nRoman Era\nIn 1989 maintenance work undertaken in the La Cour du Pont district led to the discovery of two oak piles at a depth of 2 metres. A Carbon-14 study undertaken by the centre for chronology at the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 (CNRS) gave a date between 39 BC and 120 AD.  It is possible that they were piles for a Gallo-Roman bridge used to cross the Rhone between Les Avenières and Thuellin.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages to modern times\nIn 1330 Aigline de Gerbais was married to Louis de Rivoire, knight, lord of Romagnieu, Domessin, la Bâtie-Montgascon, Villeneuve de Ciers (les Avenières), and Bruzolo en Piémont.\nIn 1496 notes and coins prove that Humbert of Baternay was deprived of the proceeds of the sale and transfer of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières by King Charles VIII.\nIn October 1496 Charles VIII issued Letters Patent ceding Dolomieu and Avenieres to Humbert of Bagternay.\nOn 22 January 1560 copies were made of letters agreed to by King Charles with René de Baternay on the subject of the lands of Ornacieux,  Dolomieu, and Les Avenières.\nOn 8 October 1609 Gabrielle de Baternay, widow of Gaspard de la Chastre, sold the lands and lordships of Avenières and Brangues as well as the Barony of Bouchage to M. of Granieu and Dorgeoise.\nIn July 1523 letters from François I stated that the possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières was held by René de Baternay. An order from the King's Council showed that René de Baternay would be restored to possession of the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières.\nOn 15 March 1642 there was a memoir and instructions on the subject of the proceedings of the King's Council regarding the lands of Dolomieu and Avenières.\n\n20th Century\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the town was served two secondary railways: the Chemin de fer de l'Est de Lyon to Lyon and Aosta, and the Tramways départementaux de l'Isère, which was taken over by Tramways de l'Ouest du Dauphiné, to La Tour-du-Pin.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Air-start system\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "An air-start system is a power source used to provide the initial rotation to start large diesel and gas turbine engines.\n\nDiesel engines\n\nDirect starting\nCompared to a gasoline (petrol) engine, a Diesel engine has a very high compression ratio, an essential design feature, as it is the heat of compression that ignites the fuel. An electric starter with sufficient power to \"crank\" a large Diesel engine would itself be so large as to be impractical, thus the need for an alternative system.\n\nWhen starting the engine, compressed air is admitted to whichever cylinder has a piston just over top dead center, forcing it downward. As the engine starts to turn, the air-start valve on the next cylinder in line opens to continue the rotation. After several rotations, fuel is injected into the cylinders, the engine starts running and the air is cut off.\n\nTo further complicate matters, a large engine is usually \"blown over\" first with zero fuel settings and the indicator cocks open, to prove that the engine is clear of any water build up and that everything is free to turn. After a successful blow ahead and a blow astern, the indicator cocks are closed on all the cylinders, and then the engine can be started on fuel. Significant complexity is added to the engine by using an air-start system, as the cylinder head must have an extra valve in each cylinder to admit the air in for starting, plus the required control systems. This added complexity and cost limits the use of air-starters to very large and expensive reciprocating engines.\n\nStarter motor\nAnother method of air-starting an internal combustion engine is by using compressed air or gas to drive a fluid motor in place of an electric motor. They can be used to start engines from 5 to 320 liters in size and if more starting power is necessary two or more motors can be used. Starters of this type are used in place of electric motors because of their lighter weight and higher reliability. They can also outlast an electric starter by a factor of three and are easier to rebuild. Engines operating in underground mining activities tend to operate on this type of starter system to reduce the risk of an electrical system igniting flammable material.\n\nAll vane type air starters should have a lubricator installed to insure long-life and maximum performance. Lubricators give the moving parts a needed friction barrier, reduce metal corrosion and keep vanes sealed properly against the cylinder walls. Even the so-called lube-free air starters require lubrication to prolong trouble free life. Two basic lubricator devices are typically employed. One is an in-line or reservoir type that typically stores up to 2 quarts of lubricant, and is installed along the air supply line. The second style of lubricator is a small one shot device that dispenses a measured amount of lubricant every time the starter is engaged. Installed directly onto the air inlet of the starter, the in-line lubricators are self priming pneumatic pumps that require a 1/4″ lubrication line piped from as far away as 4 feet. Air Starter lubricators perform best using misting type, non-detergent oils such as diesel fuel or Marvel Mystery oil. If emissions are a concern, there are environmentally friendly type lubricants available on the market.\n\nNot all air starters require lubrication.  Turbine type air starters do not require air motor lubrication, although some turbine air starters do use an oil filled transmission that may require periodic inspections and maintenance.\n\nGas turbines\nAn air-starter or huffer on a turbine engine would typically consist of a radial inward flow turbine, or axial flow turbine, which is connected to the high pressure compressor spool through the accessory gearbox, plus the associated piping and valves. Compressed air is provided to the system by bleed air from the aircraft's auxiliary power unit or from an air compressor mounted on ground support equipment.\n\nAdvantages\nCompared with electric starters, air-starters have a higher power-to-weight ratio. Electric starters and their wiring can become excessively hot if it takes longer than expected to start the engine, while air-starters can run as long as their air supply lasts. Air-starters are much simpler and are compatible with turbine engines, and thus are used on many designs of large turbofan engine that are installed on commercial and military aircraft.\n\nSee also\n Air Start Unit\nAVPIN - A monofuel used to power turbojet starter motors.\nCoffman engine starter - A similar system which uses an explosive cartridge to supply gas pressure.\n\nReferences\n\nStarting systems", "machine_text": "Air-start system - A system that is used to start engines with compressed air instead of using an electric motor or battery. An air start system uses compressed air to start engines in aircraft, marine vessels, and industrial equipment. They are commonly used in situations where the electric starter motor or battery may not be sufficient to start the engine. The air start system provides a powerful and reliable method to start an engine. The air start system consists of a high-pressure air source, air piping, and an air turbine starter motor. The high-pressure air source typically is supplied from an auxiliary power unit, ground support equipment, or an air compressor that is part of the main propulsion system. The air piping is connected to the air source and the air turbine starter motor. The air turbine starter motor is a self-contained unit that is attached to the engine gearbox and is used to turn over the engine. The air turbine starter motor is similar in construction to a gas turbine engine and is powered by the compressed air from the air source. The compressed air flows through a nozzle in the air turbine starter motor, creating a high-speed airflow that turns the turbine blades. The turbine blades are connected to the engine gearbox, providing the initial rotational force to turn the engine crankshaft. Once the engine is started, the air starter is disengaged from the engine gearbox, and the engine is left to run on its own power. In some cases, the air start system may continue to provide compressed air to the engine for a short period to assist with stabilization and smooth running. The air-start system has several advantages over traditional electric motor or battery start systems. Firstly, they provide a high-power start that is reliable and efficient. Secondly, they can be used in situations where electric power sources are not available or may not have the required power output. Finally, they are easy to maintain and have fewer components than traditional start systems, making them more reliable and less prone to failure. In summary, the air-start system is an essential component in many types of industrial equipment, marine vessels, and aircraft. It provides a reliable and efficient method of starting an engine, particularly when electric power sources may not be available or are not sufficient. Air-start systems are widely used in the aviation and marine industries, as well as in power generation, oil and gas, and other heavy equipment industries.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 194126}

Juze's wife Maria (Gauri Kamat) recognizes Santosh's intelligence and demands that he help her son, who is weak in studies. She also forces him to perform sexual favours for her. Meanwhile, Santosh has a budding romance with his classmate, Maya (Barkha Naik). However, their relationship slowly breaks apart when she realizes the helplessness of his situation. All of this ultimately leads to Santosh confronting Juze with a friend and beating him to death. Santosh then runs away from the village, and is seen waiting tables at a beachside shack.\n\nCast \n Rushikesh Naik as Santosh\n Prashanti Talpankar as Tai, Santosh's grandmother\n Sudesh Bhise as Juze\n Gauri Kamat as Maria, Juze's wife\n Barkha Naik as Maya\n\nProduction\n\nThe film is partially based on writer-director Miransha Naik's childhood experiences. The film is set in the 90s, making the character Santosh the same age as Miransha was then. The film is also set in Naik's hometown of Borimol village. He admits that some of the events and characters have been adapted from real life. He named the movie after the villain as he found it unique. He believes that the events revolve around Juze, and even though the movie is about Santosh’s journey, it simultaneously portrays the downfall of Juze.\n\nIt may be noted that Naik lost both his parents to illness at the age of 9. He grew up in Borimol along with his grandmother and two sisters, coming third in his Class X exams. He dropped out within a year of joining the BCom course at Government College, Quepem, to contribute to his household by working as a waiter. His grandmother passed away when he was 19, and he had to take responsibility of the marriages of his two sisters. By waiting tables for nearly five years, he made enough money to set up his own beachside shack, named Blue Corner, on Benaulim Beach. Two scenes in Juze show the village children watching Subhash Ghai’s Karz and Hero, which is reminiscent of Naik and his young friends and his love for movies.\n\nInitially, Naik chose a Mumbai-based actor for the role of Juze's wife, Maria, as he wasn't confident that local artistes would be up to a role with a number of sex scenes. However, the chosen actor couldn't perform because of her language barrier. Naik then turned to Gauri Kamat upon many recommendations, and after some initial hesitation, she agreed to play the part. However, by late 2015, they faced an even bigger problem: shortage of funds even before post-production. It was then that Naik thought of National Film Development Corporation’s annual \"Film Bazaar\", where it attracted the attention of noted producer Olivia Stewart, who procured funds from the Netherlands-based production company Keplerfilm and the France-based production company of Cine-Sud Promotions. Christian Jeune, who is famous as a scout for Cannes Film Festival, was also impressed with the film's idea, and the film almost made it to Cannes’ Un Certain Regard selection.\n\nThe film shows all the interesting developments (including that of his relationship with Maria and Maya) through clever and subtle camerawork, including a series of tracking shots, portraying how Santosh nonchalantly sees all this as a part of his daily life.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nThe film was well received by critics for portraying the lesser-known culture and exploitation of the poorer classes taking place in Goa (which is otherwise portrayed very glamorously in films).\n\nClarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"contemplative and topical debut, with a story offering mostly heartbreak but also a faint glimpse of hope.\" Nikki Baughan of ScreenDaily wrote, \"Juze may be an exploration of an existence which is endured, rather than lived, but there’s no trace of melodrama or didacticism.\"\n\nNotably, Juze was screened at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, the Mumbai Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, the Minsk Film Festival and the Dublin International Film Festival.\n\nAwards\n Special Jury Award at Minsk Film Festival, 2017 (director, Miransha Naik)\n\nSee also\n Konkani cinema\n Paltadacho Munis\n Nachom-ia Kumpasar\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n \n\n2017 films\nKonkani-language films\nIndian films\nFilms set in Goa\nFilms shot in Goa\n2010s Konkani-language films", "machine_text": "Juze is a mobile app that allows users to create and share augmented reality experiences.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Joseph H. Allen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an industrial businessman, an officer in the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.\n\nEarly life\nAllen was the son of John and Sarah Allen. His father was a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was originally from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old \"to carve out a fortune for himself\", as Sylvester put it in his History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in an auger factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.\n\nBefore the war\nAllen soon resumed his place in the auger factory in Connecticut, where he remained until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing augers. The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner's share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850.\n\nIn January 1851, Allen purchased the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial building in the area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory had a long history of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.\n\nThe factory was located on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was commonly used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.\n\nAllen reopened the company in 1859, having added machinery for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.\n\nPublic and armed service\n\nAllen's presence was noticeable within Brunswick. In March 1853, he presided over a meeting to incorporate the \"Church of the Disciples of Christ at the village of Millville\", now known simply as Church of the Disciples of Christ. That summer, a church building was erected at a cost of about $1,200. In 1856 Allen became the supervisor of Brunswick, a position he was reelected to once and held until 1857; he ran as a Whig. He was also elected justice of the peace in 1861, but he did not finish his term because he decided to serve in the Civil War; this time he ran as a Democrat, and remained one for the rest of his life.\n\nIn early 1862, the 125th Volunteer Infantry Regiment had been put together in Brunswick and a call by President Lincoln for more troops was answered by Allen that September. He enlisted in Company C of the 169th New York Volunteer Infantry and was chosen captain, having organized the company within six days. Most of the infantrymen came from Brunswick, though some came from surrounding towns. Residents of the town raised the money necessary to cover various \"bounties and expenses\" incurred by Allen's soldiers while en route to war.\n\nAllen participated in all the battles in which his regiment took part except a few minor ones, due to wounds he received in battle. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, the bones in his wrist were shattered, and he later incurred a flesh wound in the same wrist at the First Battle of Fort Fisher. He was also wounded in the leg near his ankle at Fort Fisher; the musket ball remained there until his death. While recovering from injuries, he was reassigned to New York to recruit new soldiers. He was promoted to the rank of major in June 1864, and, for \"meritorious conduct\" at Fort Fisher, he was recommended for promotion by President Lincoln and brevetted lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865.\n\nPost war and personal life\nAllen returned to Brunswick after the war and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.\n\nIn addition to holding the offices of justice of the peace and town supervisor, it is also said that Allen was one of the foremost supporters of education in the town. On July 6, 1847, he married Sarah H. Payne, daughter of David H. and Catharine C. Payne, of Hamden, Connecticut. The couple had two children: Sarah and Cornelia May.\n\nAllen died on April 24, 1884, and is buried in Eagle Mills Cemetery on Brunswick Road in Eagle Mills; his wife died in 1907 and is buried next to him. Based on insignia carved on his gravestone (specifically the Square and Compasses), Allen was a Mason.\n\nNotes\n\na.  In New York, a town supervisor is viewed by many to be equivalent to a mayor, but a supervisor is actually the presiding officer of the town council and is therefore part of the legislative branch; town governments in New York do not have an executive branch.\nb.  Eagle Mills is a hamlet (a small, unincorporated settlement) in the Town of Brunswick. It was previously known as Milltown and later Millville; both of these names are now defunct, though \"Milltown\" was hardly used to begin with.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n1821 births\nAmerican people of English descent\nAmerican people of Scottish descent\nPeople from Alburgh, Vermont\nPeople from Brunswick, New York\nNew York (state) Whigs\n19th-century American politicians\nNew York (state) Democrats\n1884 deaths\nUnion Army colonels", "machine_text": "Joseph H.

The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989.\n\nCase\n\nHarkins and Cooper\nOn August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985.\n\nOn October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about   from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area,  from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \"homicidal violence,\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible.\n\nRiemer and Robertson\n\nOver a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store  north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \"Mommy was in the trees.\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \"not nearly verbal enough\" to provide any information.\n\nPolice searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but  of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body.\n\nIn the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \"I love you, Diana.\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck.\n\nDue to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper.\n\nIn February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle’s Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\"\n\n2011 development\nOn March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nMedia depiction\nIn September 1989, the case was featured by the series Unsolved Mysteries.\n\nSee also\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\nList of serial killers in the United States\nList of solved missing person cases\nList of unsolved murders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAudio segment on The Trail Went Cold podcast\nCase profile at unsolved.com\nMichael Lloyd Riemer at Find a Grave\nDiana Robertson at Find a Grave\n\n1980s missing person cases\n1985 in Washington (state)\n1985 murders in the United States\nAugust 1985 events in the United States\nDecember 1985 events in the United States\nAugust 1985 crimes\nDecember 1985 crimes\nAmerican murder victims\nCouples\nCrimes in Washington (state)\nDeaths by firearm in Washington (state)\nDeaths by stabbing in the United States\nFormerly missing people\nFugitives\nMissing person cases in Washington (state)\nMurder in Washington (state)\nPeople murdered in Washington (state)\nSerial murders in the United States\nUnidentified serial killers\nUnsolved murders in the United States", "machine_text": "The Mineral, Washington murders were a series of unsolved murders that took place in Mineral, Washington between 1985 and 1986.

The third victim was 55-year-old Susan Savage, a nurse who disappeared on April 22, 1986. Her body was found a month later in a nearby forest. Like the previous victims, she had been shot multiple times. Despite an extensive investigation, no arrests were ever made in connection with these murders. The case remains unsolved to this day. Several theories have been proposed regarding the identity of the killer(s), including the possibility of a serial killer. Some have also suggested that the murders may have been related to the victims' work or personal lives. In 2011, a group of retired law enforcement officials formed a task force to re-examine the case and potentially identify new leads. However, no new information has been released publicly regarding the status of the investigation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A screw and a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below) are similar types of fastener typically made of metal and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in a matching part. \n\nScrews are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and  prevents pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; materials commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\nExplanation\nA screw is a combination of simple machines: it is, in essence, an inclined plane wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge at the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, called a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut object with an internal thread.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\nA screw will usually have a head on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include a screwdrivers and a wrench. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions. A carriage bolt has a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  A set screw may have a head the same size or smaller than the outer diameter of the screws thread; a set screw without a head is sometimes called a grub screw. A J-bolt has a J-shaped head that is sunk into concrete to serve as an anchor bolt. \n\nThe cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the pitch.\n\nMost screws and bolts are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.\n\nDifferentiation between bolt and screw\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows:\n\nThis distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt.\n\nThe issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with Machinery's Handbook distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:\n\nWood screws \nEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws. Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England. During the 1850s, swaging tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads. Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).\n\nOnce screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\nMachine screws \nASME standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\" in diameters ranging up to .  These fasteners are often used as bolts with nuts, but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\nHex cap screws \nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is  in diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  Machinery's Handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\". Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the \"Finished Hex Bolts\" and renamed them the \"Hex Cap Screw\"—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.\n\nLug bolts and head bolts \nThese terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with Machinery's Handbook distinction.\n\nLag screw \n\nLag screws (US) or coach screws (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the Handbook. However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\nUnited States government standards \nThe federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).\n\nHistorical issue \nOld USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\nControlled vocabulary versus natural language \nThe distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word bolt is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.\n\nOther distinctions\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.  On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\nTypes of screws and bolts\n\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are generally designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\nFasteners with a tapered shank\n\nFasteners with a non-tapered shank\n\nFasteners with built in washers\nA fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\nOther threaded fasteners\n\nSuperbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner \nA superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\nBone screws\n\nThe field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\nList of abbreviations for types of screws\n\nThese abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, knowing that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", it may be possible to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.\n\nThe extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.\n\nMaterials\n\nScrews and bolts are usually made of steel. \nWhere great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.\n\nGalvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. \nSome types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.\n\nOften a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.\n\nSelection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.\n\nMechanical classifications\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.\n\nMetric \n\nThe international standards for metric externally threaded fasteners are ISO 898-1 for property classes produced from carbon steels and ISO 3506-1 for property classes produced from corrosion resistant steels.\n\nInch \nThere are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 & ASTM A193.\n\nScrew head shapes\n\n  A low disc with a rounded, high outer edge with large surface area.\n Button or  Cylindrical with a rounded top.\n  A dome-shaped head used for decoration.\n Mushroom or  Lower-profile dome designed to prevent tampering.\n Countersunk or  Conical, with flat outer face and tapering inner face allowing it to sink into the material. The angle of the screw is measured as the aperture of the cone.\n Oval or  A decorative screw head with a countersunk bottom and rounded top. Also known as \"raised countersunk\" in the UK.\n  Similar to countersunk, but there is a smooth progression from the shank to the angle of the head, similar to the bell of a bugle.\n  Disc with cylindrical outer edge, height approximately half the head diameter.\n  Cylindrical, but with a slightly convex top surface. Height to diameter ratio is larger than cheese head.\n  A flanged head can be any of the above head styles (except the countersunk styles) with the addition of an integrated flange at the base of the head. This eliminates the need for a flat washer.\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.\n\ns \n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\nTools\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.\n\nThread standards\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.\n\nISO metric screw thread\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25 mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. \"M8×1\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1 mm, is made by threading a 6 mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm).\n\nMetric hexagon bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in International Standards ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\nWhitworth\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" UNC bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60° and 55° respectively.\n\nBritish Association screw thread\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order—it may be suspected—to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6 mm diameter and 1 mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch  mm (0.65 mm) and diameter  mm (3.62 mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.\n\nUnified Thread Standard\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes  inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 × number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 × 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112 inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought – seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 – (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.\n\nManufacture\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n\nThe blanks are then polished again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via thread rolling; however, some are cut. The workpiece is then tumble finished with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing. For most screws, a coating, such as electroplating with zinc (galvanizing) or applying black oxide, is applied to prevent corrosion.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile a recent hypothesis attributes the Archimedes' screw to Sennacherib, King of Assyria, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the Hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a Greek invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath Archimedes.  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.\n\nEarlier, the screw had been described by the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum (428–350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.\n\nRybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, tournevis) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and \"clinch bolts\" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735–1800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. Standardization of threadforms began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near Philipsburg for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by “rolling and wire drawing apparatus” from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. \n\nThe American development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was popularized by American Henry F. Phillips.\n\nThreadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.\n\nPrecision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution. They are key components of micrometers and lathes.\n\nOther fastening methods\nAlternative fastening methods are:\n\n nails\n rivets\n pins (dowel pins, taper pins, roll pins, spring pins, cotter pins)\n pinned shafts (keyed shafts, woodruff keys, gibb-headed key)\n screw bolt, pin bolt or cotter bolt, and clench bolt- as used in clinker boat building\n welding\n soldering\n brazing\n joinery (mortise & tenon, dovetailing, box joints, lap joints)\n gluing\n taping\n clinch fastening\n\nSee also\n\n Bolted joint\n Dowel\n Fastener\n Gender of connectors and fasteners\n Syndesmotic screw\n Tap and die\n Die head\n Thread angle\n Threaded fastener\n Threaded insert\n Threaded rod (e.g. studs, allthread)\n Threading\n Thread-locking compound\n Thread pitch gauge\n Wall plug\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n How the World Got Screwed\n NASA-RP-1228 Fastener Design Manual\n Imperial/Metric fastening sizes comparison\n \"Hold Everything\", February 1946, ''Popular Science\" article section on screws and screw fastener  technology developed during World War Two\n How to feed screws and dowels\n\nMetalworking\n \nWoodworking\nArticles containing video clips", "machine_text": "Screw A screw is a type of fastener that is used to hold two or more objects together. It has a helical structure that is designed to fit inside a hole or pre-drilled surface. The helical structure is also responsible for creating a force that holds the objects together. Screws are commonly used in construction, woodworking, and manufacturing. The anatomy of a screw consists of three primary components: the head, the shank and the thread. The head is the top part of the screw that is used to turn it with the help of a screwdriver, a drill or other tools. The shank is the cylindrical part of the screw that fits inside the hole. The thread is the helical structure that wraps around the shank. The thread is what provides the screw with its gripping power. There are several types of screws available, each with specific uses. Some of the most common types of screws include wood screws, machine screws, sheet metal screws, and lag screws. Wood screws are used in woodworking projects such as furniture and cabinets. Machine screws are used in manufacturing and electronics. Sheet metal screws are used to fix thin pieces of metal together. Lag screws are used in construction to secure heavy objects. Screws can be made from a variety of materials, including steel, brass, bronze, and titanium. The material used depends on the application and the level of strength required. For example, steel screws are commonly used in construction because of their strength, while brass screws are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. In conclusion, screws are a ubiquitous and essential component in everyday life. Their versatility and usefulness cannot be overstated. Despite their simple design, screws are vital in a wide range of applications and continue to be an important aspect of modern life.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20691673}

The special features a series of fictional characters discussing US and UK events of 2020 including the COVID-19 pandemic and US presidential election. It was released on Netflix on 27 December 2020. The mockumentary received mostly negative critical reception, with reviewers criticising the jokes as obvious, though some of the cast performances were praised. A sequel special, Death to 2021, was released on December 27, 2021.\n\nSynopsis\nIn mockumentary format, characters discuss events of 2020 with a mixture of true information and satire. The overarching topic is the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the US and UK. The 2020 United States presidential election is also heavily featured. Events in the early part of the year include the latter part of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, Greta Thunberg's environmental speeches at the World Economic Forum, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan stepping down from the British royal family and the 2020 Oscars. The May 2020 murder of George Floyd and subsequent US protests are summarized, with commentary on the Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church and protesters removing the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, England.\n\nOn the topic of the pandemic, characters comment on the 2020 royal addresses to the nation in the UK, two national lockdowns in England, online circulation of false information, vaccine trials and the first uses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial. With regards to the US election, topics under discussion include acquittal of the impeached Donald Trump, Democratic primaries between Bernie Sanders and the successful Joe Biden, presidential debates between Biden and Trump, The New York Times reports on Trump's tax returns and Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as running mate. After Biden won the election, Trump attempted to overturn results with a series of false claims and unsuccessful lawsuits.\n\nThe mockumentary closes with characters delivering lines that jokingly predict events of 2021.\n\nCast\n Samuel L.

He had created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is \"more character-based\" and he does not serve as presenter. He also described it as \"sillier\", summarising it as \"part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy\".\n\nIt is produced by Broke and Bones, which Brooker and Annabel Jones founded after departing from House of Tomorrow, the production company they had worked with for the Endemol Shine group in producing Black Mirror. The two reportedly left House of Tomorrow over intellectual property rights issues. Netflix has a deal for exclusive rights over Broke and Bones productions. Death to 2020 is its first full production after the co-production Antiviral Wipe.\n\nThe special was written with a team of writers over four months. It was filmed in late November across 10 days, in London and Los Angeles. Minimal crews were used due to the pandemic, with some actors in production bubbles. Each actor filmed for only one day. The Los Angeles filming shortly preceded a local lockdown there. Unlike Wipe specials, Brooker does not appear on-screen, but plays a director asking the talking heads questions. This decision was made partially because of an expectation that non-UK audiences would not be familiar with his appearance. Additionally, Diane Morgan appears in a different role—rather than recurring Wipe character Philomena Cunk, she plays Gemma Nerrick, ostensibly \"one of the five most average people in the world\". Cristin Milioti previously starred in Black Mirror episode \"USS Callister\".\n\nActors influenced their characters' portrayal, with Brooker highlighting Kudrow in particular as having a number of things she felt strongly about. To appeal to a global audience, UK subjects such as the Dominic Cummings scandal were avoided. News of Biden's win and the Pfizer vaccine rollout arrived days before filming. Brooker and Jones were both involved with the editing process.\n\nActor Hugh Grant revealed the project's existence in an interview with New York magazine in late November 2020, saying Brooker had written a mockumentary about the year 2020, which was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and described by some as a real-life version of a Black Mirror episode. Brooker said Grant would play the role of a historian who's being interviewed about the year. Further details of the special were announced in early December 2020, including many of the principal cast.\n\nReception\n\nCritics branded the mockumentary as \"disappointing\", and compared it unfavourably to Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and Black Mirror. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes,  of  critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of . According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 11 critics, it received \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIn a one star review for The Independent, Ed Cumming found that he was often \"waiting for punchlines that never arrive\", saying that Grant is \"not given a single decent line\". Cumming criticised the absence of Brooker's narration, as found in the Wipe series, and wrote that the work \"can't make up its mind whether it is for a British audience or an American one\".\n\nChris Bennion gave the special two stars out of five in a review for The Telegraph, believing it to be a \"huge disappointment\" in which the humour is \"as predictable as the targets of the jokes\". Though reporting that most of the jokes are \"at best wearily familiar\", Bennion did find a few that \"carry Brooker's acidic wit and giddy surrealism\" and praised that Grant \"adroitly captures the pomposity of the Grand Old TV Don\". Another two star review came from Evening Standards Nancy Durrant, who found it \"not as good\" as the Wipe specials. Durrant opined that a runtime of 45 minutes \"would have been quite enough\". Durrant praised Grant, Kudrow, Milioti and Morgan and the characters' names, along with some small jokes.\n\nThough praising some of the characters, including Jackson, Fishburne and Milioti, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B– in a negative review which summarised the mockumentary as \"obvious jokes over familiar footage\". Handlen found nothing \"particularly insightful\" and criticised \"a few lame stabs at 'both-sides-ing' the polarization of American politics\". The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg summarised the work as a \"generally hacky piece of recycled political satire and tired documentary parody\". Finding it \"astonishing how lazy everything is\", he viewed it as worse than many American topical comedies and said that the humour comes \"almost exclusively from the enthusiasm of an impressively star-studded cast\". However, Fienberg praised Milioti and Morgan and found it \"appropriate\" that Jackson discusses most of the George Floyd protest content with \"only anger and outrage\". The Los Angeles Times called the mockumentary a \"bitingly funny, hastily assembled and slightly deranged comedic retrospective\".\n\nSequel\n\nA programme in the same style, Death to 2021, aired on 27 December 2021, produced by Broke and Bones. Alongside returning cast such as Grant, Ullman and Morgan, the mockumentary starred new members including Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing and William Jackson Harper. According to Digital Spy, Brooker had a reduced role, not participating as executive producer due to work on other projects. Instead, the executive producers were Jones and Ben Caudell—a writer for Cunk on Britain, a programme starring Morgan's character Philomena Cunk.

He was born in Manises in 1842, but emigrated to Argentina in 1875, where he led civil engineering projects and took part in hydraulic works in Brazil, the Andes and Patagonia. Besides that, he was involved in the design and planning of La Plata city and the port of La Campana, which he also built. On July 14th, 1889, he left Argentina with his enormous paleontological collection aboard the ship Mateo Bruzzo, arriving at the port of Barcelona in the midst of great expectation. A special train was chartered to transport the valuable collection to Valencia, arriving the evening of August 9th.\nThe collection is made up of a large number of mammal fossils belonging to the South American Quaternary, including a human skeleton called Samborombón considered to be the star of the collection. It was the focus of a great amount of scientific discussions in the early 20th century due to the postulate of the tertiary antiquity of the origin of mankind. \nHe was accompanied by Enrique De Carles, the main fossil collector and naturalist technician of the Museum of Buenos Aires. He was the main person in charge of the mounting of the skeletons until his early departure in June 1890, when the city of Valencia suffered the last cholera outbreak. \nIt was this year when the collection was moved from the San Gregorio's Convent to a municipal property located at number 62 of Ruzafa Street, where it remained temporarily until 1896. The collection was placed in an old Jesuit building, the San Pablo's Hospital, next to the Alquería de Julià, far from the historical center.\n\nIn 1904, José Rodrigo Botet, the main donor of the museum's collection, died in Madrid. Eduardo Boscá Casanoves (1843–1924), senior gardener of the Botanical Garden of the University of Valencia, with firm evolutionary beliefs, becomes the first director of the Municipal Museum of Paleontology, and together with the exhibition fitter Carlos Maicas, they continued the work with the skeletons that Enrique de Carles started.\nWith the celebration of the IV Centenary of the University of Valencia in 1902, the City Council of Valencia decided to exhibit the collection to the general public for the first time. San Pablo's Hospital building turned out to be inefficient for the conservation and exhibition of the collection. For this reason, the City Council of Valencia proposed the execution of a new building that would be located in Pla del Real (Llano del Real in Spanish) whose purpose would be Botet's collection to exhibit it to the public. The new building, which was planned to be named as the Valencian Palace of Natural Sciences, never was built due to lack of funding. Instead, the collection was deposited in a new location at Almodí building (Almudín in Spanish), an old 14th century corn exchange located in the heart of the historic district of Valencia — just a few meters from the Cathedral and which currently has an exhibition hall.\nThe new location allowed the paleontological collection to be visited by the general public, opening in 1908 as the Municipal Museum of Paleontology. In 1924 Eduardo Boscá Casanoves, first director of the museum, and one of the greatest advocates of the social broadcasting of Botet's paleontological collection, died. That same year he was succeeded by Don Francisco Beltrán Bigorra, who expanded the museum's collections with an enormous malacological collection donated by Eduardo Roselló Bru in 1925.\nFor the following decades, the museum remained open to the public at this location, so that the Almudín building became a synonym of Paleontology Museum, until torrential rains in 1989 accelerated the deterioration of the building, which was declared dilapidated. Authorities evicted the collection in the face of the danger of collapse, without a precedent in Europe of a transfer of that magnitude since the Second World War.\nThe collection was moved to the ground floor of the town hall, in the old Municipal Exhibition Hall, and first opened on 2 July 1991. During 1996, the City Council approved a rehabilitation project for the old Viveros restaurant and the creation of the Natural Science Museum that would host the collection of the Museum of Paleontology. To boost the didactic value of the collections, a project that respected the most current museographic tendencies was developed. In 1999 the current Museum of Natural Sciences of Valencia was opened — at the same location where the City Council projected the construction of the Valencian Palace of Natural Sciences at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nBuilding \nThe rationalist building, which the Museum of Natural Sciences currently takes in, corresponds to the former luxury restaurant Restaurante Viveros. This building was built in the late 1950s, and was designed by the Valencian architect Luis Gay, whose work was influenced by the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, precursor of the Bauhaus. The building is considered a unique building and has a grade 2 listed building\n\nCollections \n\nRodrigo Botet's collection is possibly the best European collection of fossils from the South American Pleistocene, consisting of twenty skeletons and more than five thousand bones belonging to more than twenty different mammal families.\n\nMuseum galleries \n\n Science and Technology: This room is dedicated to the history of science and contains the first electronic microscope of Valencia, acquired in 1966 by the Institute of Cytological Research, now the Valencian Foundation for Biomedical Research. The recreation of a scientific cabinet of the 19th century, similar to that of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, stands out.\n Biodiversity: A room for the description and dissemination of Valencian biodiversity. It includes a virtual visit to the natural spaces of El Saler and La Devesa.\n Origin of Life: Paleozoic.\n Rodrigo Botet Paleontological Collection: In this room, where the Rodrigo Botet collection is exhibited, is the most representative and spectacular example of the museum, a complete skeleton of a six-meter-long Megatherium. We can also find in this room the skeletons of a great bear, a saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon ensenadensis) and several giant armadillos, among which the most outstanding ones are an Eutatus seguini, a Neosclerocalyptus and a Glyptodon clavipes. The specimens from Rodrigo Botet's collection are mentioned by Charles R. Darwin in his work the Origin of Species, which made the collection highly sought after by prestigious European museums of the time.\n Mesozoic and Cenozoic\n Dinosaurs of the Valencian Community\n Sites of the Valencian continental Neogene: In the museum we can find the skull of a 5 million year old sirenia found in Pilar de la Horadada (Alicante), belonging to the genus Metaxitherium, the group of the current dugongs.\n Malacology: A part of the collection donated in 1925 by Eduardo Roselló Bru is exhibited in this room.\n Ecosystems and city birds\n Beekeeping\n Temporary exhibitions\n\nAreas \nIt consists of four distinct areas:\n\n The Valencian contribution to Natural Sciences.\n The History of life, a journey through the different eras into which the age of the Earth is usually divided. Also on display in this area is the Museum's most important paleontological collection, which is the legacy of J. Rodrigo Botet, a fabulous example of Quaternary paleontology from South America. Of particular importance is the specimen of Megaterio, an emblematic piece of the Museum;\n Malacology, an interesting collection of mollusk shells, which is a complete representation of the malacological fauna of the Valencian Community.\n Valencian ecosystems.\nThe municipality of Valencia has great wealth and variety of ecosystems. It is very difficult to find in the same space, a city of almost a million inhabitants, a riverbank ecosystem, the sea, a vegetable garden with high agricultural productivity and the nuclei of greatest naturalistic value of the Parc Natural de l'Albufera de València (Valencian Albufera Nature Park), such as the Albufera and the Devesa.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nMuseums in Valencia\nCultural tourism in Spain\nNatural history museums in Spain\nFossil museums\nMuseums established in 1889", "machine_text": "The Natural Science Museum of Valencia is a museum located in the city of Valencia, Spain.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Thrice Woven\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Thrice Woven is the sixth studio album by American black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room. The album was released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label, Artemisia Records. The album was produced collaboratively with Randall Dunn and recorded primarily in their own recording studio Owl Lodge in Olympia, Washington, which the Weaver brothers built themselves, with the drums recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle. Thrice Woven received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release.\n\nBackground \nThrice Woven is the first black metal album by Wolves in the Throne Room since 2011's Celestial Lineage, which the band consider the final chapter in a trilogy of albums comprising Two Hunters, Black Cascade, and Celestial Lineage. The band regard their 2014 ambient album Celestite as being a companion piece to Celestial Lineage, rather than a successor, and have also stated categorically that Thrice Woven is not connected with the previous records; as a result, Thrice Woven can be considered the band's first 'true' album since 2011. It is also the first album recorded almost entirely in the band's home studio Owl Lodge, and is their first album to feature new permanent band-member Kody Keyworth on guitars and vocals.\n\nRecording, production \nThe album was recorded almost entirely at the band's home studio, Owl Lodge, in Olympia, Washington. The band recorded the drums at Litho Studio in Seattle with Jack Shirley. According to Aaron Weaver, \"Once we finished the drums, we brought the sessions back to our studio in Olympia, Randall Dunn showed up and we kind of made a plan on how to put the record together.\" He also explained that \"Me and Nathan would work by ourselves, tracking guitars, synthesizers, whatever then Randall would show up and kind of check it out and give suggestions. He tracked a lot of stuff too — he always plays a little bit of synthesizer on our records. Once all the tracking was wrapped up, we met up with Randall again in Seattle and mixed at Avast! Studio\". In a separate interview, Aaron Weaver explained that \"About halfway through recording, we realized it was time to invite Kody Keyworth to be a full member of the band. He'd been playing guitar on the road with us for six years. As we were recording Thrice Woven, we just realized that Kody's got to be on this record — he's a part of this band from now on.\" As a result, Keyworth \"added flavor to Thrice Woven but was uninvolved in the initial work on these songs.\"\n\nMusical style, writing \nThrice Woven has been described as significantly more aggressive and traditionally black metal than many of the band's previous albums, and both critics and the band themselves have noted the role of new guitarist Kody Keyworth in the album's sound. NPR Music wrote that the album's opening track \"recalls the WITTR of Two Hunters and Black Cascade, but is immediately bolder, with a newfound ferocity that feels untethered to the past.\" Decibel noted that the album \"is defined in a good deal of traditionalism, specifically second-wave black metal traditionalism.\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek likewise noted that \"Thrice Woven re-engages with blackness, full signature riffs, epic tunes, and tales of pagan nature worship that established Wolves in the Throne Room's identity. This is a return to the pummeling, multi-layered power that made 2009's Black Cascade a masterpiece.\"\n\nRelease, promotion, marketing \nWolves in the Throne Room announced the initial details (including the track listing, release date, and album cover) of Thrice Woven on June 28, 2017, along with a brief teaser trailer. On July 17, the band premiered their first ever music video for the song \"Born from the Serpent's Eye\", featuring the first half of the nearly 10-minute piece. According to the band, \"We lit a bonfire and blasted through the first third of our song Born From The Serpent’s Eye. [sic] This is the first time we’d played the song with new guitarist Kody Keyworth and it fucking slayed. Peter and Nico captured the magic. May the good fires blaze!” On August 21 the band premiered the song \"Angrboda\" in full as part of Adult Swim's Singles 2017 series. On September 11, they also premiered the song \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean\" as a companion piece to the previously released \"Angrboda\". The album was officially released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label Artemisia Records.\n\nTouring \nThe band have announced they will tour the United States throughout Fall 2017 with Pillorian from September 29 to October 25. They have also announced a European tour from November 15 to December 15, 2017 with support from Aluk Todolo and Wiegedood.\n\nCritical reception \n\nThrice Woven was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCritics generally noted the considerably more aggressive and traditionally black metal approach of the album, particularly compared to the band's previous records. The A.V. Club wrote that \"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band’s live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld\", but noting that \"this being a WITTR record, the fury comes in crashing waves, emerging monstrously from stretches of placid calm\" Decibel named the album 'Best New Noise' and praised Thrice Woven as \"a return to the glories of old\", highlighting the strength of the songwriting in particular.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\nWolves in the Throne Room \n Nathan Weaver — vocals, guitars\n Aaron Weaver — drums, synthesizers\n Kody Keyworth — guitars, vocals\n\nAdditional musicians \n Don McGreey — acoustic guitar (on track 1)\n Steve Von Till — vocals, acoustic guitar (on track 2)\n Anna Von Hausswolff — vocals (on tracks 1 and 4)\n Phil Petrocelli — percussion (on track 4)\n Zeynep Oyku Yilmaz — grand harp (on track 4)\n\nTechnical and additional personnel \n Randall Dunn — production, engineering\n Jason Ward — mastering\n Jack Shirley — engineering\n William Smith — additional engineering\n Denis Forkas Kostromitin — artwork\n John Westrock — photography\n\nReferences \n\n2017 albums\nWolves in the Throne Room albums\nBlack metal albums by American artists", "machine_text": "Thrice Woven is the fifth studio album released by the American black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room. The album was released on September 22, 2017, through the band's own label, Artemisia Records. The album explores themes related to nature, mysticism, and transcendence. The album consists of five tracks, all of which showcase the band's signature blend of atmospheric black metal and ambient music. The album opens with \"Born from the Serpent's Eye,\" a nine-minute track that sets the tone for the rest of the album with its slow-building atmosphere and vivid imagery. \"The Old Ones Are with Us\" and \"Angrboda\" are both mid-tempo tracks that feature haunting melodies and intricate guitar work. The album's centerpiece is the nearly 12-minute-long \"Mother Owl, Father Ocean,\" which begins with an eerie soundscape and builds to a powerful crescendo of distorted guitars and thunderous drums. The album concludes with \"Fires Roar in the Palace of the Moon,\" a somber and reflective track that brings the album to a satisfying close. Thrice Woven was well-received by critics, many of whom praised the album's epic scope and emotional depth. The album charted on a number of Billboard's charts, including the Heatseekers Chart and the Independent Albums chart.

As a result of injuries sustained at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, he was paralysed. As of 2007 he could only move his head, torso, and an arm.\n\nCareer \nBrito played as a winger, and spent his career playing for Biscarrosse Olympique in the Fédérale 3 division of French rugby. An electrician by trade, he was noticeable on the field for his long dreadlocks as well as his brave play. Brito was called into the Ivorian national team squad for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Brito came on as a substitute in the opening game against Scotland which the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of \"minor\" teams in the tournament. He played again in the second game for Les Elephants, who put in a vastly improved performance against France, despite losing 54–18.\n\nInjury \nBrito started Ivory Coast's third match against Tonga on 3 June. He caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae.  Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralysed below the neck.\t\n\nAfter the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Nevertheless, in 2007, it was reported that Brito was still largely unable to move, being bedridden most of the time, with only some limited movement in his chest and arms. He and his wife have separated, whilst he has little contact with his sons, and he now lives with his parents in Bordeaux. There has been some criticism of how his case was handled, after the initial support: Damian Hopley, Head of the Professional Rugby Players' Association, said in 2003, \"We became involved in money-raising events for Max ... but there was very little support for him from Rugby World Cup.\"  \n\nIn his 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying: \"It is now 12 years since I have been in this state. I have come to the end of my tether... If one day I fall seriously ill, and if I have the strength and courage to take my own life, then I will do it...This bloody handicap - it's my curse. It kills me and I will never accept it. I can't live with it and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBut in 2020, in an interview with i, he revealed he had undergone a spiritual transformation that had helped him cope with his disability.\n\n\"I would say there were 13 or 14 years of fog where I didn't know where I was. The accident was very violent. But after that I had a spiritual enlightenment and I understood that it was necessary to accept my handicap. And from that moment on, all the doors were open.\"\n\nReferences \n\n1971 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Abidjan\nPeople with tetraplegia\nIvorian rugby union players\nRugby union wings\nIvorian expatriate rugby union players\nExpatriate rugby union players in France\nIvorian expatriate sportspeople in France", "machine_text": "Max Brito is a French cybersecurity expert, author, and trainer.

The JAXCC is one of seven NCI-designated Cancer Centers with a focus on basic research.\n\nThe Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center has a single program, \"Genetic Models for Precision Cancer Medicine,\" composed of three biological themes: cancer cell robustness, genomic and genetic complexity, and progenitor cell biology. The themes emphasize the systems genetics of cancer and translational cancer genomics, and all are supported by the JAX Cancer Center's technological initiatives in mouse modeling, genome analytics and quantitative cell biology.\n\nThe Morrell Park fire\nOn May 10, 1989, a flash fire destroyed the Morrell Park mouse production facility. The fire raged for five hours, requiring over 100 firefighters from 15 companies and a total of 16 trucks for the fire to be contained. Four workers of the Colwell Construction Company who were installing fiberglass wallboard in the room where the fire broke out were injured, one with burns over 15 percent of his body. While none of the foundation strains were lost, 300,000 production mice (about 50% of their stock) died, resulting in a national shortage of laboratory mice and the layoff of 60 employees.\n\nThis was the second fire to severely affect the laboratory; the 1947 fire that burned most of the island destroyed most of the laboratory, and its mice.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Goyescas (opera)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Goyescas is an opera in one act and three tableaux, written in 1915 by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados. Granados composed the opera to a Spanish libretto by Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar with melodies taken from his 1911 piano suite, which was also called Goyescas. The opera was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 28, 1916.\n\nPerformance history\nPrevented by World War I from being presented at the Paris Opéra, the premiere of Goyescas took place on January 28, 1916 at the Metropolitan Opera. It was the first opera to be performed there in Spanish.  Paired on a double bill with Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, the opera's cast included the leading artists Giovanni Martinelli and Giuseppe De Luca. The stage production was directed by Jules Speck. It featured sets by the Milanese designer Antonio Rovescalli, and costumes by G. B. Santoni that followed the paintings of Goya.\n\nThe opera was well received. In his review for the New York Times, Richard Aldrich wrote that the music was \"profoundly felt\" and possessed \"an intensely national color\". In spite of this success, the short opera has never found a permanent place in the opera repertoire. It has not yet been repeated at the Met following its original five performances. More recently, Goyescas was presented in a well-received production at Central City Opera (Colorado) in 2003.\n\nThe Intermezzo from the opera became a popular independent concert piece. It is performed in arrangements for orchestra, and for cello and piano.\n\nA Spanish film of Goyescas, adapted from the opera, was made in 1942. It was directed by Benito Perojo and starred Imperio Argentina.\n\nBackground\nGranados was inspired to write his popular piano suite by the paintings of Francisco Goya. After the enthusiastic response to the piano work, he was encouraged to compose the opera by Ernest Schelling, an American pianist who premiered the suite in the U.S.\n\nRegarding Goyescas, the composer wrote, \"I am enamored with the psychology of Goya, with his palette, with him, with his muse the Duchess of Alba, with his quarrels with his models, his loves and flatteries. That whitish pink of the cheeks, contrasting with the blend of black velvet; those subterranean creatures, hands of mother-of-pearl and jasmine resting on jet trinkets, have possessed me.\"\n\nThe opera was based on themes from the famous piano suite of 1911, which he orchestrated and augmented to form a three-scene work.  The libretto had to be fitted to existing melodies, the reverse of the usual way of writing an opera. Though the opera is rarely performed, the piano suite forms part of the standard Romantic piano repertoire.\n\nThe success of the Met premiere of Goyescas led indirectly to Granados's death. He was invited by President Woodrow Wilson to perform a piano recital at the White House, causing him to postpone his return to Spain. Granados and his wife lost their lives on March 24, 1916 when their ship, the French steamer Sussex, was torpedoed by a German U-boat in the English Channel.\n\nRoles\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe story of Goyescas is based on a series of six paintings from Francisco Goya’s early career, inspired by the stereotypical young men and women of the majismo movement.  These majos and majas are known for their bohemian attitude and soft spot for finery. The opening scene is directly based on his 1791 painting ‘El Pelele’, painted for Charles IV of Spain to hang in his textile mill, although the painting implies a satire of the monarch’s popularity.\n\nFirst Tableau\nThe majos and majas are enjoying an afternoon outside the Church of San Antonio de la Florida.  As the Manzanares River meanders in the distance, the fun loving troupe spend their time dancing, feasting, and playing a traditional game known as the pelele.  This game involves a human replication made of straw being thrown up in the air by a group using a stretched out sheet.  As they flirt and chatter, Paquiro enters, surrounded by women.  He calls all the ladies unique garden flowers, and they swoon for him, but all of them know who he supposedly belongs to. Pepa enters the scene riding her dog cart, and the men crowd around her excitedly, as she thanks them for making her feel welcome.\nSuddenly, the attention is on two richly dressed lackeys bearing a sedan-chair, and in which the high born lady Rosario waits for her lover.  Paquiro wastes no time approaching this mystery woman.  He recalls a time when she appeared at one of their lantern-lit balls, and invites her again that very night.  Rosario ignores him, but her indifference goes unnoticed by Fernando, captain of the royal guard, who was hiding away and spying on her and Paquiro.  Fernando assumes that she was flirting, and although she flatly denies it, he does not trust her.  They continue arguing while Pepa and the ladies mock them.  Fernando decides that Rosario will accept the invitation, but that he will accompany her. They leave promptly, and after sharing their plans to ruin the lovers, Pepa and Paquiro leave on their dog cart.\n\nSecond Tableau\nAt the ball that night, all the majas are dancing, while the majos watch eagerly.  Fernando enters dragging Rosario, whom Pepa proceeds to make fun of the minute she walks through the door.  Fernando assures Rosario that he will defend her honor.  Upon this, Paquiro makes a spectacle of asking Rosario to dance, and Pepa questions his motives jealously.  Fernando insults Paquiro's honor, while Rosario protests. Paquiro suggests a duel to prove his valor. A brawl begins, the women holding back Paquiro and the men from rushing Fernando, and Rosario faints in the excitement.  After setting the time and place of the duel, Fernando leaves with Rosario.  Pepa, returning to the center of attention, engages the crowd in a fandango.\n\nThird Tableau\nLater that night, Rosario sits on a bench in the palace garden, listening to the sad song of a nightingale under the light of the moon.  As she moves to go inside, Fernando approaches the house, calling to her.  She responds sorrowfully, but always lovingly, and he doubts her claims of total devotion. They share a loving moment, ruined by the presence of Paquiro, who is dressed in a black cloak with Pepa trailing furtively.  Fernando makes ready to leave, and Rosario clings to him, begging him to stay.  Fernando tears himself away, promising to return victorious, and leaves.  Rosario follows, and the duel begins.\nTwo screams signal the end of the duel, one by Fernando being mortally wounded, the other by Rosario.  Paquiro flees, dragging his cloak behind him.  Rosario drags the mortally wounded Fernando to the bench where they had just shared their tender moment.  She holds him against her bosom, and they share one last kiss before he dies in her arms.\n\nNotable references in other pieces of art\nMexican songwriter Consuelo Velázquez based her 1940 song Bésame Mucho on the melody of the Aria of the Nightingale from the third tableau.\n\nRecordings\n Consuelo Rubio (Rosario), Gines Torrano (Fernando), Ana-Maria Iriarte (Pepa), Manuel Ausensi (Paquiro); Madrid Cantores, Spanish National Orchestra, Ataúlfo Argenta (conductor); Decca Records LXT 5308 (1 LP) 1955\n María Bayo (Rosario), Ramón Vargas (Fernando), Lola Casariego (Pepa), Enrique Baquerizo (Paquiro); Orfeón Donostiarra, Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid, Antoni Ros-Marbà (conductor); Auvidis V4791 (1 CD) 1996\n Rafaella Angeletti (Rosario), Yikun Chung (Fernando), Francesca Franci (Pepa), Davide Damiani (Paquiro); Coro ed Orchestra del Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos (conductor); Dynamic CDS380 (CD) 2001 live\n Maria Toledo, Nancy Fabiola Herrera, Gustavo Pena, Lidia Vinyes Curtis, BBC Singers, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Josep Pons harmonia mundi, DDD/LA, 2018\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLink to Synopsis of Goyescas at Music with Ease.com\n\nOperas\nOne-act operas\nSpanish-language operas\nOpera world premieres at the Metropolitan Opera\n1916 operas\n1910s in Spanish music\nOperas set in Spain\nOperas by Enrique Granados\nMusic based on art\nFrancisco Goya", "machine_text": "Goyescas is an opera in one act composed by Enrique Granados.

Influenced by the paintings of Francisco Goya, Goyescas is considered to be an example of Spanish Nationalism in music. Granados explores the themes of love, jealousy, and dueling in the plot, which takes place in a Spanish village. The opera features beautiful melodies, intricate harmonies, and virtuosic piano accompaniments. The opening prelude, \"Los Requiebros,\" is a particularly well-known piece that showcases the composer's skillful combination of Spanish and romantic musical styles. The opera's libretto is written in Castilian Spanish by Fernando Periquet. The main characters of the opera are named Rosario and Fernando, who are lovers and are unaware of the other's romantic feelings. Rosario is married to Paquiro, a torero who is jealous of Fernando. The opera climaxes in a scene where Paquiro challenges Fernando to a duel. Goyescas has been produced by opera companies around the world, and it has been recorded by many opera singers and pianists. A ballet adaptation of the opera was also created by Russian choreographer Mikhail Fokine in 1920, which featured music from the opera and additional music by Granados. Sadly, the history of this opera is blemished by a tragic event. The composer and his wife died at sea when their ship, the Sussex, was torpedoed by a German U-boat during World War I. Granados had premiered another of his works, the \"Hymn of the Cross\" which he had composed in honour of the victims of the war, three days before his death. Today, Goyescas remains a beloved piece of Spanish music, and Granados is regarded as one of Spain's most important composers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 19645895}

He became one of the most prominent figures in the field of public service broadcasting, and his contributions had a significant impact on the development of modern educational broadcasting. Born in Riverton, Utah, Merrill was the son of a farmer. He attended Brigham Young University and the University of Utah, where he earned a degree in political science. Merrill first entered the broadcasting field in 1922 when he joined the staff of KSL in Salt Lake City. He quickly became a prominent voice on the station, broadcasting on a variety of topics ranging from news to sports. In 1925, Merrill began a series of educational programs on KSL, which were later syndicated nationally. These programs were innovative in their use of radio as an educational tool, and they served as a model for many other educational broadcasters. Merrill's programs covered a wide range of topics, including history, science, and politics, and they were geared towards both children and adults. In 1933, Merrill was appointed head of the newly created educational broadcasting division of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). In this capacity, he oversaw the creation of many educational programs, including the highly successful \"Human Adventure\" series. Merrill's work at NBC helped to establish educational broadcasting as a vital component of the American broadcasting industry. Merrill retired from NBC in 1957 but continued to be active in the broadcasting industry. He served as a consultant to many educational broadcasters and was a frequent speaker at conferences and seminars. In recognition of his contributions to the field of educational broadcasting, Merrill was inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1984. Prex Merrill's influence can still be seen in the educational programming that is produced today. His dedication to the use of radio as a tool for education helped to pave the way for the development of other media, such as television and the internet, as educational tools.

It was the primary operating base for Italian airline Air Italy whose headquarters were located at the airport. It mostly handles seasonal holiday flights from destinations in Europe and is managed by Geasar S.p.A.\n\nHistory\n\nA military airfield was opened at Olbia (then Terranova Pausania) in 1921, and a seaplane base was inaugurated close to the Isola Bianca harbour in 1927, although poor loads from the island on the flights to Ostia and Cagliari led to the service's stop in Terranova being discontinued in 1929. The airfield and seaplane base were targeted by Allied bombing in World War II, and the Germans opened another airfield 4.5 miles west of the town, which was renamed Olbia in 1945.\n\nCommercial flights gradually returned and in 1963, the Olbia-based airline Alisarda was formed. It successfully expanded its route network, introducing jet flights in 1972, and it was renamed Meridiana in 1991. However, the introduction of jet aircraft necessitated the building of a larger airport nearer the city; the current airport was completed in 1974.\n\nFollowing three years of work, a new terminal covering 42,000 square metres and capable of handling 4.5 million passengers per year, was unveiled on 6 June 2004. Costing a total of €81 million, the structure was designed by Willem Brouwer Architects and incorporated the original terminal building, which was developed into a 3000-square metre retail area. The new building has 40 check-in desks and ten boarding gates, five of which are equipped with jet bridges. It contains a wide variety of shops and restaurants, a wine bar, a small art gallery, and indoor garden areas featuring local flora.\n\nThe airport also is home to the Tourist Management department of the University of Sassari.\n\nFrom 3 February to 14 March 2020, the airport closed to passenger air traffic for the refurbishment and extension of the taxiways and runway. During this period, all flights arriving and departing were cancelled.  The airport building remained in this period open to events of various kinds. The airport, which was initially scheduled to reopen on March 14, 2020, remained closed until June 2, as a result of the measures taken by the Italian authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her work was widely anthologized and translated into various languages, including Italian, Japanese and Finnish.\n\nBiography \nShe was born in the Peak District, Derbyshire, in 1936, and attended the University of Bristol where she received her BA in French. She then moved to Australia for ten years, where she was a Tutor in French at the University of Queensland while studying for her M.A. and Ph.D., both on French Surrealism. In 1971 she returned to the UK, and settled in Helston, Cornwall, in 1974, where she undertook tutoring in Twentieth-Century Poetry for the Open University and for the University of Exeter Extra-Mural programme, while writing and publishing her major works of poetry. She was appointed as Cornwall's first Writer in the Community in 1986, and was regularly invited to give Poetry Workshops and courses at the Arvon Foundation. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Exeter in recognition of her literary achievements in 1989, and many of her literary papers are held in the University of Exeter archive. She lived on her own in Helston from 1990 until her death.\n\nWork \nHer first work, Time & Motion (1975) was published in Australia under the name \"Sylvia Kantarizis\", and her poetry is sometimes republished under that name in anthologies of Australian poetry. However, most of her work was published in Britain, and some of her poetry has a specifically Cornish theme. Her second major book, The Tenth Muse (1983) explores the relationship of women to writing, and \"through its title, evokes a whole tradition of women's poetry\". Shortly after its publication, she was involved in a lively feminist debate in the Letters pages of The Times Literary Supplement concerning a fictional \"Hysterical Women's Movement\" that many contemporary reviewers of women's writing appeared to believe in. Her next collection, The Sea at the Door (1985) is described by one reviewer as \"a haunted book – haunted by past and present selves, none of them quite real\", noting particularly the way in which she often engages intense erotic themes through the filter of imagination and dreams. Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona. The Air Mines of Mistila (1988), written in collaboration with the poet Philip Gross, has a Latin American theme, with allusions to the novel Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo in a number of the poems. This collection won the Poetry Book Society Choice of 1988. Her next published book, Dirty Washing (1989) contains selected poems drawn from four previous books together with several new poems.

She was born in Athens, Greece in 1950 and received her early education at the Athens School of Fine Arts. Kantaris later moved to the United States, where she continued her education at the Art Institute of Chicago and the New York Studio School. Kantaris' work is influenced by her Greek heritage and her interest in mythology and nature. Her paintings often depict abstracted landscapes and figures, imbued with a sense of movement and emotion. Her use of vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes creates a dynamic, gestural quality to her work. One of Kantaris' most notable works is a large-scale triptych titled \"Ode to Democracy.\" Created in response to the Greek debt crisis, the painting features a central figure representing the Greek people, surrounded by symbols of democracy and Greek mythology. The painting was featured in a solo exhibition at the Hellenic American Union in Athens in 2015. Kantaris has exhibited her work in galleries and museums internationally, including the National Gallery of Greece, the Chicago Cultural Center, and the Hellenic American Union. Her work is also held in private collections in the United States, Greece, and Europe. In addition to her painting career, Kantaris is also a passionate advocate for the arts. She has served on the board of directors for various arts organizations, including the Hellenic American Cultural and Educational Foundation and the International Art Alliance. Kantaris now divides her time between New York City and Athens, where she continues to create and exhibit her work. She remains an influential figure in the Greek-American arts community, inspiring and encouraging younger generations of artists.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58399288}

It is also known by its chemical name of polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate, or by its trade name of Tween 20. Polysorbate 20 is a yellow to amber viscous liquid that is soluble in water and has a faint odor. It is derived from sorbitan, a naturally occurring substance in fruits and berries, and ethylene oxide, a petrochemical compound. In the food industry, polysorbate 20 is used as an emulsifier, which helps to blend oil and water-based ingredients together. It is commonly found in baked goods, ice cream, and salad dressings. Polysorbate 20 is also used as a stabilizer, preventing the separation of ingredients in processed foods. Pharmaceutical companies use polysorbate 20 in the production of vaccines, ensuring that the active ingredient and adjuvants remain evenly dispersed throughout the product. It is also used as a solubilizer, allowing drugs to dissolve in water and improve their bioavailability. In the cosmetics industry, polysorbate 20 is used as a surfactant, helping to create a smooth and even texture in products such as lotions and creams. It is also used as a fragrance solubilizer and foam booster. While generally considered safe for consumption and use, there have been reports of polysorbate 20 causing skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. It is important to follow the recommended usage levels and properly label products containing polysorbate 20.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"55 Cancri\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "55 Cancri is a binary star system located 41 light-years away from the Sun in the zodiac constellation of Cancer. It has the Bayer designation Rho1 Cancri (ρ1 Cancri); 55 Cancri is the Flamsteed designation (abbreviated 55 Cnc). The system consists of a K-type star (designated 55 Cancri A, also named Copernicus ) and a smaller red dwarf (55 Cancri B).\n\n, five extrasolar planets (designated 55 Cancri b, c, d, e and f; named Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot, respectively) are believed to orbit 55 Cancri A.\n\nNomenclature\n55 Cancri is the system's Flamsteed designation. It also bears the Bayer designation ρ1 Cancri (Latinised to Rho1 Cancri) and the Bright Star Catalogue designation HR 3522. The two components are designated A and B, though A is itself sometimes referred to as 55 Cancri. The first planet discovered orbiting 55 Cancri A was designated HR 3522b by its discoverers, though it is more commonly referred to as 55 Cancri b. Under the rules for naming objects in binary star systems it should be named 55 Cancri Ab and this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with the secondary star 55 Cancri B. The other planets discovered were designated 55 Cancri c, d, e and f, in order of their discovery.\n\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Copernicus for 55 Cancri A and Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot for its planets (b, c, d, e and f, respectively).\n\nThe winning names were those submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. They honor the astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe and Thomas Harriot and the spectacle makers and telescope pioneers Hans Lipperhey and Jacharias Janssen. (The IAU originally announced the winning name was Lippershey for 55 Cancri d. In January 2016, in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey (with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century), the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information).\n\nIn 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nStellar system\nThe 55 Cancri system is located fairly close to the Solar System: the Gaia astrometry satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 79.45 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of . 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just visible to the naked eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of  (6.15 light-days). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.\n\nThe primary star, 55 Cancri A, has a spectral type of K0IV-V, indicating a main-sequence or subgiant star. It is smaller in radius and slightly less massive than the Sun, and so is cooler and less luminous. The star has only low emission from its chromosphere, and is not variable in the visible spectrum; but it is variable in X-rays. It is more enriched than the Sun in elements heavier than helium, with 186% the solar abundance of iron; it is therefore classified as a rare \"super metal-rich\" (SMR) star. 55 Cancri A also has more carbon than the Sun, with a C/O ratio of 0.78, compared to solar value of 0.55. This abundance of metal makes estimating the star's age and mass difficult, as evolutionary models are less well defined for such stars. 55 Cancri A is much older than the solar system, and its age has been estimated to values of 7.4–8.7 billion years or 10.2 ± 2.5 billion years.\n\nA hypothesis for the high metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone would mean that the outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.\n\nObservations of 55 Cancri A in the submillimeter region of the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within  of this star is about 850 mJy, at a wavelength of 850 μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not exclude the presence of an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.\n\nThe secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than the Sun. There are indications that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.\n\nPlanetary system\n\nThe 55 Cancri system was the first known to have four, and later five, planets, and may possibly have more. The innermost planet, e, transits 55 Cancri A as viewed from Earth. The next planet, b, is non-transiting but there is tentative evidence that it is surrounded by an extended atmosphere that does transit the star.\n\nIn 1997, the discovery of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted for by this planet, which could be explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.\n\nIn 1998 the discovery of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40 AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the plane of the sky. However, the discovery could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.\n\nAfter making further radial velocity measurements, a planet orbiting at a distance of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.\n\n55 Cancri e was announced in 2004. With 8.3 Earth masses, it is a large super-Earth which was originally thought to have an orbital period of 2.8 days, though it was later found that this was an alias of its true period of 0.74 of a day by observations of e transiting in 2011. This planet was the first known instance of a fourth extrasolar planet in one system, and was the shortest-period planet until the discovery of PSR J1719−1438 b. The measurements that led to the discovery of this planet also confirmed the existence of 55 Cancri c.\n\nIn 2005, Jack Wisdom combined three data sets and drew two distinct conclusions: that the 2.8-day planet was an alias and that there was a Neptune-scale planet with a period near 261 days. Fischer et al. (2008) reported new observations that they said confirmed the existence of the 2.8-day planet, as first reported by McArthur et al. (2004), and a 260-day Neptune-sized planet, as first reported by Wisdom (2005). However, Dawson and Fabrycky (2010) concluded that the 2.8-day planet was indeed an alias, as suggested by Wisdom (2005), and that the correct period was 0.7365 of a day.\n\nIn 2007, Fisher et al. confirmed the existence of the 260-day planet proposed in 2005 by Wisdom. This planet, 55 Cancri f, was the first occurrence of a fifth extrasolar planet in one system. With a similar mass to c, it has a 260-day orbit, towards the inner edge of 55 Cancri A's habitable zone. The planet itself is not thought to be conducive to life, but hypothetical moons in principle could maintain at least microbial life.\n\nThe planet e's eccentricity is poorly defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking interactions between the planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.\n\nAstrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° of the outer planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-sight, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclinations have been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar in order to maintain stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.\n\nThe approximate ratios of periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance, rather than a genuine mean motion resonance.\n\nBetween planets f and d, there appears to be a huge gap of distance where no planets are known to orbit. A 2008 paper found that as many as 3 additional planets of up to 50 times the mass of Earth could orbit at a distance of 0.9 to 3.8 AU from the star, and stable resonances of an hypothetical planet g with the known planets were found to be 3f:2g, 2g:1d, and 3g:2d. A study released in 2019 showed that undiscovered terrestrial planets may be able to orbit safely in this region at 1 to 2 AU; this space includes the outer limits of 55 Cancri's habitable Zone.\nAs for the space outside d's orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, though there is a stability zone between 8.6 and 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.\n\nCommunication\nA METI message was sent to 55 Cancri. It was transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar—the  Evpatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 2; it was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 55 Cancri in May 2044.\n\nSee also\n Sudarsky's gas giant classification\n Cancer in Chinese astronomy\n Kepler-186\n Lists of exoplanets\n Gliese 1132 b – rocky exoplanet with a confirmed atmosphere\n Mu Arae c – At constellation Ara\n Planetary system\n PSR B1257+12\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n \n When the Gods Fall 55 Cancri in fiction.\n Extrasolar Planet Interactions by Rory Barnes & Richard Greenberg, Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona\n The First and the second part of a computer animation of the 55 Cancri planetary system.\n Interactive visualisation of the 55 Cancri system\n\n \nCancri, Rho1\nBinary stars\nCancer (constellation)\nCircumstellar disks\nBD+28 1660\nCancri, 55\nK-type main-sequence stars\nCancri, 55\n0324\n075732\n043587\n3522\nPlanetary systems with five confirmed planets\nPlanetary transit variables\n2\nK-type subgiants", "machine_text": "55 Cancri, also known as Rho^1Cancri in the Bayer designation, is a binary star system located approximately 40 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cancer.

The other planets in the system include a Jupiter-like gas giant, two Neptune-like planets, and a fourth planet with an unknown mass. The discovery of the planets around 55 Cancri A was significant, as it was one of the first known systems with multiple exoplanets. It was also the first exoplanetary system discovered to have a configuration similar to that of the Solar System, with multiple planets in a nearly circular orbit around a central star. In addition to its planets, 55 Cancri A has been studied for its characteristics as a star.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Subcountability\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In constructive mathematics, a collection  is subcountable if there exists a partial surjection from the natural numbers onto it. \nThis may be expressed as\n\nwhere  is the set of natural numbers ( with disregard for arithmetic) and where  denotes that  is a surjective function from  onto .\nIn other words, all elements of a subcountable collection  are functionally in the image of an indexing set of counting numbers  and thus the set  can be understood as being dominated by the countable set .\n\nDiscussion\n\nExample \nAn important case is where  denotes some subclass of a bigger class of functions as studied in computability theory. \n\nConsider the total computable functions and note that being total is not a decidable property, i.e. there cannot be a constructive bijection between the total functions and the natural numbers. However, via enumeration of the codes of all possible partial computable functions (which also allows non-terminating programs), subsets of those, such as the total functions, are seen to be subcountable sets. Note that by Rice's theorem on index sets, most domains  are not recursive. Indeed, no effective map between all counting numbers  and the infinite (non-finite) indexing set  is asserted here, merely the subset relation . Being dominated by a constructively non-countable set of numbers , the name subcountable thus conveys that the uncountable set  is no bigger than .\n\nThe demonstration that  is subcountable also implies that it is classically (non-constructively) formally countable, but this does not reflect any effective countability. In other words, the fact that an algorithm listing all total functions in sequence cannot be coded up is not captured by classical axioms regarding set and function existence. We see that, depending on the axioms of a theory, subcountability may be more likely to be provable than countability.\n\nRelation to Excluded Middle \nIn constructive logics and set theories, which tie the existence of a function between infinite (non-finite) sets to questions of effectivity and decidability, the subcountability property splits from countability and is thus not a redundant notion. \nThe indexing set  of natural numbers may be posited to exist, e.g. as a subset via set theoretical axioms like the separation axiom schema, so that \n. \nBut this set may then still fail to be detachable, in the sense that\n\ncannot be proven without assuming it as an axiom.\nOne may fail to effectively count  if one fails to map the counting numbers  into the indexing set , for this reason.\n\nIn classical mathematics \nAsserting all laws of classical logic, the disjunctive property of  discussed above indeed does hold for all sets. Then, for nonempty , the properties numerable ( injects into ), countable ( has  as its range), subcountable (a subset of  surjects into ) and also not -productive (a countability property essentially defined in terms of subsets of , formalized below) are all equivalent and express that a set is finite or countably infinite.\n\nNon-classical assertions \nNot asserting the law of excluded middle \n for all proposition , \nit can then also be consistent to assert the subcountability of sets that classically (i.e. non-constructively) exceed the cardinality of the natural numbers.\nNote that in a constructive setting, a countability claim about the function space  out of the full set , as in , may be disproven. But subcountability  of an uncountable set  by a set  that is not effectively detachable from  may be permitted.\n\nAs  is uncountable and classically in turn provably not subcountable, the classical framework with its large function space is incompatible with the constructive Church's thesis, an axiom of Russian constructivism.\n\nSet theories\n\nCantorian arguments on subsets of the naturals \nAs reference theory we look at the constructive set theory , which has Replacement, Bounded Separation, strong Infinity, is agnostic towards the existence of power sets, but includes the axiom that asserts that any function space  is set, given  are also sets. \nIn this theory, it is moreover consistent to assert that every set is subcountable. \n\nThe compatibility of various axioms is discussed in this section by means of possible surjections on an infinite set of counting numbers .\n\nThe situations discussed below—onto function spaces versus onto power classes—are different insofar as for functions , by definition there exists a unique return value for every value  in the domain, . As opposed to general predicates and their truth values (not necessarily just true and false), a function (which in programming terms is terminating) makes accessible information about data for all its subdomains (subsets of the ). Viewed as characteristic functions, they decide membership. As such, in , the (total) functions  are not automatically in bijection with all the subsets of  Constructively, subsets are a more involved concept than characteristic functions. \n\nIn fact, in the context of some non-classical axioms, even the power class of a singleton, e.g. the class  of all subsets of , is shown to be a proper class.\n\nOnto function spaces\nAsserting the permitted subcountability of all sets turns, in particular,  into a subcountable set. \n\nSo here we consider a surjective function  and the set comprehended/separated as\n\nwith the diagonalizing predicate defined as\n\nwhich we can also phrase without the negations as\n.\nThis set is classically a function in  and can classically be used to prove that the existence of the  is actually contradictory.\nHowever, constructively, unless the proposition  in its definition is decidable so that the set actually defined a functional assignment, we just cannot draw this conclusion.\n\nIn this fashion, subcountability of  is permitted. Nevertheless, also in the case of , the existence of a full surjection , with domain , is indeed contradictory, since membership of  is decidable.\n\nBeyond these observations, also note that for any non-zero number , the functions  in  involving the surjection  cannot be extended to all of  by a similar contradiction argument. In other words, there are then partial functions that cannot be extended to full functions .\nNote that when given a , one cannot necessarily decide whether , and so one cannot even decide whether the value of a potential function extension on  is even already determined for a surjection .\n\nThe subcountibility axiom, asserting all sets are subcountable, is incompatible with any new axiom making  countable, including .\n\nOnto power classes\nNext we study possible postulates of the existence of a surjection . (This, by Replacement in  would imply  is a set.) The violating subset of  is\n\nwhich, as , in this case simplifies to just\n \nwhere \n\nadapted from Cantors theorem about power sets. That subset exists via Separation. The existence of the surjection immediately implies the existence of a number  with \n, \nrendering membership necessarily undecidable and incompatible with any realization. \nPropositions of this form, , must be rejected according to the consequences of the negation introduction law. So such a surjection does not exist and  cannot be subcountable.\n\nWe conclude that the subcountability axiom, asserting all sets are subcountable, is incompatible with  being a set, as implied e.g. by the power set axiom.\n\nThe notion of size \nAs seen in the example of the function space considered in computability theory, not every infinite subset of  necessarily is in constructive bijection with , thus making room for a more refined distinction between uncountable sets in constructive contexts. \nThe function space  (and also ) in a moderately rich set theory is always found to be neither finite nor in bijection with , by Cantor's diagonal argument. This is what it means to be uncountable. But the argument that the cardinality of that set would thus in some sense exceed that of the natural numbers relies on a restriction to just the classical size conception and its induced ordering of sets by cardinality.\nMotivated by the above sections, the infinite set  may be considered \"smaller\" than the class . Subcountability as judgement of small size shall not be conflated with the standard mathematical definition of cardinality relations as defined by Cantor, with smaller cardinality being defined in terms of injections out of  and equality of cardinalities being defined in terms of bijections. \nMoreover, note that constructively, an ordering \"\" like that of cardinalities can be undecidable.\n\nModels \nThe above analysis affects formal properties of codings of . Models for this non-classical extension of  theory have been constructed. \nSuch non-constructive axioms can be seen as choice principles which, however, do not tend to increase the  proof-theoretical strengths of the theories much. \n\nMore examples:\n There are models of  in which all sets with apartness relations are subcountable.\n In the constructive set theory , as discussed, it is indeed consistent to assert the Subcountability Axiom that all sets are (internally) subcountable. The resulting theory is in contradiction to the Axiom of power set and with the law of excluded middle.\n More stronger yet, some models of Kripke–Platek set theory validate that all sets are even countable.\n\nSubcountable implies not -productive \nAny countable set is subcountable and any subcountable set is not -productive:\nA set  is said to be -productive if, whenever any of its subsets is the range of some partial function  on , there always remains at least one element that lies outside that range. This may be expressed as\n\nA set being -productive speaks for how hard it is to generate its elements: They cannot be generated using a single function. As such, -productive sets escape subcountability.\nDiagonal arguments often involve this notion, be it explicitly or implicitly.\n\nSee also\n Cantor's diagonal argument\n Computable function\n Constructive set theory\n Schröder–Bernstein theorem\n Subquotient\n Total order\n\nReferences \n\nConstructivism (mathematics)", "machine_text": "Subcountability refers to a mathematical concept that deals with the size of sets. In particular, subcountability is a measure of how many elements a subset of a set has. It is a weaker form of countability, which measures the size of a set itself. Subcountability is a useful concept for understanding certain aspects of set theory and topology, as well as for analyzing the complexity of algorithms and data structures. A set is considered subcountable if it has at most the same number of elements as some countable set. For example, the set of natural numbers is countable, and so any subset of the natural numbers (such as the set of even numbers) is subcountable. Another way to think of subcountability is that a set is subcountable if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a countable set. For example, the integers are countable, and so any subset of the integers can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and is therefore subcountable. One important application of subcountability is in the study of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. In this context, a set is called a Schauder basis if every element of the vector space can be written as a linear combination of countably many elements from the set. Schauder bases are important for understanding various aspects of functional analysis, and subcountability plays a crucial role in their definition and properties. Another application of subcountability is in the analysis of algorithms and data structures. In particular, subcountability is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and data structures on sets of varying sizes. Algorithms that are subcountable are often more efficient than those that are not, since they can take advantage of the structure and properties of subcountable sets to achieve faster running times and use less memory. Overall, subcountability is an important concept in mathematics and computer science, with applications in diverse areas such as set theory, topology, functional analysis, and algorithm analysis. Its properties and applications are still actively studied and researched by mathematicians and computer scientists today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15036487}

It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s. \n\nThe name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.\n\nThe area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.\n\nFarmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nUnincorporated communities in Alachua County, Florida\nUnincorporated communities in Florida", "machine_text": "Arredondo is a small unincorporated community located in Alachua County, Florida, United States.

Dr. Darren Lund made a complaint about the letter to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission. In 2008, a human rights panel ruled that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt,\" ordering Boissoin to apologize to Lund and pay $5,000 in damages. Boissoin appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. In 2009, the Court of Queen's Bench overturned the Panel's ruling. In 2012, the Court of Appeal of Alberta upheld the Queen's Bench decision.\n\n2002 letter to the Red Deer Advocate\nIn June 2002, Reverend Stephen Boissoin, Central Alberta Chairman of the Concerned Christian Coalition, sent a letter to the Red Deer Advocate. The letter said, \"Where homosexuality flourishes, all manner of wickedness abounds\". The letter claimed that \"Homosexual rights activists and those that defend them, are just as immoral as the pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps that plague our communities.\"\n\nThe newspaper published the letter on 17 June 2002.\n\nHuman rights complaint and litigation\n\nAlberta Human Rights Panel\nOn  18 July 2002, Dr. Darren Lund, a professor at the University of Calgary, filed a complaint against Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition with the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, alleging that Boisson's letter constituted discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as prohibited by Alberta's Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act. A one-member Alberta Human Rights Panel accepted Lund's arguments that the letter was \"likely to expose homosexuals to hatred and/or contempt.\" The Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervened in the case, condemning the views expressed in the letter but arguing they should not be subject to legal sanction.\n\nOn 30 May 2008, the Alberta Human Rights Panel ordered Boissoin and the Concerned Christian Coalition to refrain from publishing future disparaging remarks about homosexuals and provide Lund with a written apology and in $5,000 damages.\n\nCourt of Queen’s Bench of Alberta\nBoissoin appealed the ruling to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. On 3 December 2009, the Court overturned the decision of the Alberta Human Rights Panel. The Court found that the contents of the letter did not violate the Alberta Human Rights Act, and that the remedies which had been imposed were either unlawful or unconstitutional. The Court also identified \"troubling aspects of the process leading to the decision of the Panel,\" including the inclusion of the Concerned Christian Coalition as a respondent.\n\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta\nIn March 2010, Lund appealed the Court of Queen's Bench ruling to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. In October 2012, the Court dismissed the appeal, ruling in favor of Boissoin. The Court agreed with the lower court that Boissoin’s letter was \"a polemic on a matter of public interest and does not qualify as reaching the extreme limits... to expose persons to hatred or contempt,\" within the meaning of the Alberta Human Rights Act. The Court also stated that \"it is not clear that Boissoin could have phrased the same purely political opinion in any more acceptable or polite way than he chose.\"\n\nOpposition from Ezra Levant\nJournalist Ezra Levant was a fierce critic of the case and the provincial human rights commission.  He republished Rev. Boissoin's letter verbatim, resulting in a complaint against Levant. When the Alberta Human Rights Commission dismissed the resulting complaint in November 2008, Levant accused the human rights commissions of religious discrimination, asserting that \"100% of the CHRC's targets have been white, Christian or conservative\" and that \"It's legal for a Jew like me to publish [Boissoin’s letter].

The case involved Rev. Stephen Boissoin, a pastor in Alberta who had written a controversial letter to the editor of a local newspaper, expressing his anti-homosexual views. In response, a university professor named Dr. Darren Lund filed a human rights complaint against Boissoin, alleging that his letter constituted hate speech and targeted a minority group. The case ultimately went to the Alberta Human Rights Commission, which found Boissoin guilty of promoting hatred and awarded Lund $5,000 in damages. Boissoin appealed the decision, arguing that his right to free speech had been violated. The case ultimately reached the Court of Queen’s Bench, which overturned the human rights tribunal’s decision. The court ruled that Boissoin’s letter was indeed protected speech under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that the human rights tribunal had not taken into account his right to express his opinions. The Lund v Boissoin case has been influential in shaping Canadian human rights law, both in terms of free speech and the limits of hate speech. Supporters of Boissoin saw the case as a victory for the protection of free speech rights, while opponents argued that it represented a setback for anti-discrimination efforts.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Gun laws in Georgia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Gun laws in the state of Georgia regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of Georgia in the United States. The Georgia Constitution, like many other state constitutions, guarantees to its citizen the right to keep and bear arms. Article one, section one, paragraph VII of the Georgia Constitution states: \"The right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but the General Assembly shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne.\"\n\nSummary table\n\nOverview\nOn June 8, 2010, Senate Bill 308 was signed by Governor Sonny Perdue reforming and clarifying many of Georgia's Gun Laws, while leaving certain restrictions in place.\n\nGeorgia is a \"shall issue\" state, with the Georgia Weapon's Carry License application to be submitted through the probate court of the county of residence. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age, unless they provide proof of basic training and service in the military.\n\nAccording to the Georgia Department of Law, \"Georgia will recognize the weapons carry licenses, both resident and non-resident, from any other state provided that that state likewise recognizes a Georgia license.\" The states recognized under reciprocity include:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. A non-resident of Georgia to whom has been issued a firearm license by a state listed above may carry a firearm while in Georgia in accordance with Georgia law. This includes non-residents under the age of 21.\n\nSouth Carolina H3799 was signed by Gov Haley on June 3, 2016, allowing reciprocity with Georgia WCL licenses.\n\nThere are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit. No permit is needed:\n To carry a firearm in a person's home, place of business, or vehicle\n To carry a long gun in a fully open and exposed manner\n To carry an unloaded firearm in a case\n To carry a firearm in someone else's vehicle, provided you would qualify for a permit\n To carry a firearm while fishing or hunting, if you have a valid fishing or hunting license\n\nState preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership, transportation, and possession of firearms. Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances.  This means that local parks, offices, etc. of non-Federal government agencies may not prohibit those with a valid Georgia Weapons License from carrying.  Federal regulations continue to prohibit carrying weapons on Corps of Engineers and US Postal Service property.\n \n\nFirearm regulations are uniform throughout the state, and a firearms permit is valid throughout the state, in all areas other than in a few specially-defined areas. These specially-defined prohibited areas include:\nIn a government building, where ingress into such building is restricted or screened by security personnel and overseen by a POST certified, sworn peace officer\nIn a courthouse\nIn a jail or prison\nIn a place of worship, unless the governing body or authority of the place of worship permits the carrying of weapons or long guns by license holders\nIn a state mental health facility\nOn the premises of a nuclear power facility\nWithin  of any polling place, only during an election.\nOn school grounds (incl. building and grounds), unless carrying or picking up a student, or permitted in writing by an official of the school, however weapons may be securely stored in vehicles parked on school grounds.\n\nAs exceptions to the above list, a person may keep their firearm in a locked compartment of their vehicle at any of the above places except nuclear power facilities. Also, a person may approach security or management of any of the above places (except schools and nuclear power facilities) and ask them for directions on removing, securing, storing, or temporarily surrendering the weapon.\n\nAs of July 1, 2006, Georgia became a \"Stand Your Ground\" state, and requires no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, or defense of others.\n\nGeorgia law allows private firearm sales between residents without requiring any processing through an FFL.\n\nA Kennesaw, Georgia city ordinance requires that all homeowners own a firearm and ammunition (Sec 34-1a). No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance. An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm, convicted felons, those who cannot afford a firearm, and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, Georgia's gun laws were again revised when Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60, the Safe Carry Protection Act. The Safe Carry Protection Act changed many of the currently enacted gun laws in place beforehand.\n\nIn 2017, the Georgia legislature passed HB 280, which allows for concealed carry permit holders to carry concealed handguns on public college campuses. Governor Nathan Deal signed it into law on May 4, 2017. The law took effect July 1, 2017 on all University System of Georgia Campuses, including universities, colleges, and trade schools under the University System.  Under HB280 any Georgia Weapons Licensee may carry on University System of Georgia property if they are carrying concealed.  They may not carry in any dormitory or Greek house owned by the University System, in any athletic venue used for intercollegiate sports, in any daycare facility on campus with limited entry (gated), in any classroom with a currently enrolled high school student, in any private office space, or in any room currently in use for disciplinary proceedings. HB280 does not remove the prohibition against carry on private university and college property under Georgia Law.\n\nSome counties have adopted Second Amendment sanctuary resolutions.\n\nCode Section 16-11-130(a)(3) exempts Active duty Military from laws concerning carry of weapons and prohibited carry locations (Code Sections 16-11-126 through 16-11-127.2) just as it does for law enforcement officers.  Law enforcement offices are exempt in the same code (Code Section 16-11-130(a)(1)).\n\nSee also\n\n Law of Georgia (U.S. state)\n Safe Carry Protection Act\n\nReferences\n\nGeorgia (U.S. state) law\nGeorgia", "machine_text": "Gun laws in Georgia refer to the legal framework governing the possession, carrying, and use of firearms in the state. Georgia is known for having an overall permissive attitude towards gun ownership, reflected in its relatively lax gun laws. This has led to criticism from gun control advocates who argue that the state's lenient policies have contributed to a higher rate of gun violence in Georgia. Background and history Georgia's gun laws have a long and complex history dating back to the state's founding. The state's constitution includes a provision that explicitly guarantees the right to bear arms, which has been upheld by the courts. In recent years, the state has passed a number of laws that have expanded the rights of gun owners and NRA members. This has included measures like the \"stand your ground\" law, which allows the use of deadly force in certain situations, and the legalization of concealed carry in most public places. Current gun laws in Georgia Georgia is an open-carry state, which means that gun owners can openly carry firearms in most public places without a permit (with some exceptions). The state also permits concealed carry with a license, which requires a background check and firearms training. There are some gun-free zones in Georgia, including government buildings, schools, and certain businesses. Georgia also has a \"shall-issue\" law for concealed carry permits, which means that the state is required to issue a permit to anyone who meets the basic criteria (including passing a background check) unless they have a disqualifying criminal record or history of mental illness. The permit is valid for five years and must be renewed before it expires. Criticism and controversy Critics of Georgia's gun laws argue that they make it too easy for dangerous individuals to obtain firearms, which in turn contributes to a higher rate of gun violence in the state. Some advocates for gun control have called for stricter regulations on firearms ownership in Georgia, including expanded background checks, stricter licensing requirements, and tighter restrictions on concealed carry in public places. Conclusion Overall, Georgia's gun laws represent a balance between the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the need to protect public safety. While the state has some relatively permissive policies when it comes to gun ownership, it also has a number of regulations in place to help prevent dangerous and irresponsible use of firearms.

It was written and directed by Kurt Sutter, the original series creator and co-written by Dave Erickson. It originally aired in the United States on November 30, 2010.\n\nThis episode marks the last appearance of Ally Walker (Agent June Stahl), Paula Malcomson (Maureen Ashby) and Titus Welliver as (James 'Jimmy' O'Phelan)\n\nPlot\nSalazar takes Tara to Jacob Hale's office, where he takes Hale hostage as well. When he gives his list of demands, one of them is for Jax to come to Hale's office. Tara sees Salazar pull out a knife, and he tells her he plans to kill her while Jax watches and then kill Jax. As Jax enters the office, Salazar is about to kill Tara, but Jacob Hale stabs him instead. Jax wrestles the gun from Salazar, gives it to Tara, and tells her to kill anyone who is not a cop. When the whole ordeal is over with Jax and Tara go to the doctor for an ultrasound to make sure the baby was not harmed. The baby is healthy and Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax and Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and happily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has become more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in the trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she wears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong. When Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually a trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught and fearing that the club will kill him in prison. With the help of Unser, Chibs Telford kills Jimmy O'Phelan in retribution for stealing his wife and daughter many years ago, before Opie forces a terrified Stahl in the front seat of the cop car. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, \"This is what she felt.\" He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a MAC-10, instantly killing her, to avenge the death of his wife Donna. After this, Chibs rigs the scene to look as if the real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy. Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress Maureen Ashby, implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death should it happen. The rest of SAMCRO, enroute to prison, celebrate their victory over Jimmy and Stahl.\n\nReception\nIGN voted Agent Stahl's death #10 in their list of the biggest deaths, They said: \"The ending of Season 3 was one of the more gratifying twists the show ever had. Things seemed bleak when Agent Stahl informed the club that Jax had made a deal and ratted them out. But what she didn’t know was that it was all a setup, one that ended with her dead as Opie got his revenge for her setting him up and getting his wife killed. The season ended on an unexpectedly up note as Clay and Jax smiled and the rest of the guys in the prison van shared a laugh. Sure they were on their way to prison, but Jax wasn’t a rat and Stahl was out of the picture for good.\"\n\nZach Handler of The A.V. Club gave \"NS\" an A- rating, stating; \"What worked the best about 'NS' and what allows me to be optimistic about next season's potential, even while having largely mixed feelings on this season overall, is the ending. The episode doesn't manage to make all the IRA stuff feel organic, and Hal Holbrook doesn't pop back in to remind us about that basically innocent housekeeper that got murdered a while back, but it does introduce a new threat to the Sons, and, unlike Cameron and his Disappearing Baby Trick, this threat fits in beautifully with the context of the show overall. Maureen smuggled John's letters to her in Jax's backpack, and Tara found them. Reading them, while Jax and Clay grin at each other in triumph and while Gemma sits with her grandson in her arms, propped up like a queen on her throne, we hear Teller's voice-over again. It's long been hinted at that Clay and Gemma had something to do with John's death. This is a Hamlet riff, after all. And now Tara, the outsider who finally found her way to belonging, has reason to be suspicious. Makes you wonder what else is in those letters. And it makes you wonder what Jax'll do if he reads them.\"\n\nReferences\n\n2010 American television episodes\nSons of Anarchy episodes", "machine_text": "NS is a fictional outlaw motorcycle club featured in the popular American television series, Sons of Anarchy. The club is headquartered in northern California and is depicted as one of the largest and most powerful outlaw motorcycle gangs in the series. NS is introduced in the second season of Sons of Anarchy as a rival club to the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO). The two clubs engage in a heated and violent conflict throughout the season, with NS being portrayed as a particularly dangerous and ruthless organization. The club is led by Ethan Zobelle, a businessman who uses his wealth and influence to further the club's criminal activities. NS is primarily involved in the distribution of white supremacist literature and the trafficking of illegal drugs. In addition to Zobelle, NS is comprised of a number of other key members, including his enforcer A.J. Weston and his wife Polly. The club also maintains ties with other white supremacist organizations, such as the League of American Nationalists. Despite their formidable reputation, NS ultimately proves to be no match for SAMCRO. Zobelle is killed by Jax Teller, the protagonist of Sons of Anarchy, and the remaining members of NS are either arrested or driven out of town. NS is notable for its portrayal of white supremacist ideology and the violent tactics used by outlaw motorcycle clubs. The depiction of the club and its activities has been controversial, with some critics accusing the series of glamorizing and even promoting the lifestyle of outlaw bikers.

What some people may not know is that there was a computer video game version of Monopoly that was released in 1985. The game was developed by Leisure Genius for the MS-DOS and Apple II computer systems and published by Parker Brothers, who are the owners of the Monopoly trademark. The video game version of Monopoly stayed true to the original board game by requiring players to buy, sell, and trade properties in an effort to collect rent from their opponents. Players could also build houses and hotels on their properties to increase the amount of rent they could collect. The game also featured computer-controlled opponents for people who did not have anyone to play with. The graphics of the game were simple and lacked the modern polish that we are accustomed to seeing in video games today. The game board was displayed on the screen, along with a list of the properties that had been bought and sold by each player. Players could use a mouse or keyboard to navigate the game and make their moves. The Monopoly video game received mixed reviews when it was released. Some reviewers praised the game for staying true to the original board game, while others criticized the graphics and lack of innovation. Despite the mixed reception, the game did well commercially and was followed by several sequels and spin-offs. In conclusion, the Monopoly video game that was released in 1985 was an important part of video game history. It was one of the earliest attempts to bring a board game to the computer and it paved the way for future games in the genre.

Appearance and Characteristics Mantises are known for their distinctive elongated and slender bodies, large eyes, and two pairs of wings. The forelegs of mantises are modified for grasping and hunting prey, this unique adaptation is what gives them their signature \"prayer-like\" stance. These insects come in various shapes and sizes and range in color from green and brown to pink and yellow. The females are typically larger in size compared to their male counterparts. Habitat and Diet Mantises are commonly found in gardens, forests, and other areas with vegetation. They are known to inhabit both warm and temperate climates. Mantises are carnivorous and feed on a variety of insects such as moths, flies, and crickets. These insects can consume prey that is larger in size than they are, making them one of the most efficient predators. Behavior Mantises are known for their highly intelligent and instinctive behavior. When they feel threatened, they adopt a defensive posture, spreading their wings and exposing their brightly colored forelegs to intimidate their predators. Mantises are also known to engage in cannibalism, with the female sometimes eating the male during or after mating. Conservation Mantises are not considered endangered, but their populations are declining due to habitat destruction, use of pesticides, and other human activities. There is a growing concern among conservation groups about the loss of biodiversity and the impact of habitat destruction on ecosystems. In conclusion, the mantis genus is a fascinating group of insects that has captured the imagination of people for centuries. With their remarkable adaptations and behavior, they provide a unique insight into the complex and diverse world of insects.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14753484}

It is characterized by extreme nationalism, authoritarianism, and a belief in the necessity of strong leadership and the use of force to achieve national goals. One of the key traditions of Russian Fascism is its emphasis on a strong centralized government and the rejection of liberal democracy and individual rights. This is reflected in the rise of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and the communist governments that held power throughout Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Another tendency of Russian Fascism is its militarism and expansionist ambitions. This is illustrated by the Soviet Union's efforts to expand its sphere of influence during the Cold War, culminating in the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Movements that have been influenced by Russian Fascism include the National Bolshevik Party, which emerged in the 1990s and was led by Eduard Limonov. The party held extreme nationalist and anti-liberal views and called for the establishment of a strong authoritarian state. Another example is the Eurasianist movement, which began in the 1920s and was led by Russian intellectuals who believed in the importance of a Eurasian identity that would unite Russia with other countries in the region. Despite these various movements and tendencies, Russian Fascism has not gained widespread support in Russia itself. Instead, it remains a relatively small and fringe movement, with many Russians rejecting its extreme views and authoritarianism. Nonetheless, its legacy continues to influence political discourse in Russia and beyond.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2847842}

It ran from 2000 to 2005. Its concept was developed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe prior to the television series. Alongside the television series, the show had a run in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre between 17 April and 12 May 2001 from which a ‘Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned - Live in the West End’ DVD was released.\n\nFormat\n\nThe intro to the show begins with a slow pan along an empty street before focussing on actor Lewis Rose who sings the intro before the crowds come in to join with a chant of \"It'll never work\" and head into the theatre to watch the show. Baddiel and Skinner eventually join in with the crowds and enter themselves, singing \"And neither will we again!\"\n\nThe show features the two hosts sitting on a couch on-stage and responding to questions from the audience – at times rather seriously, but usually with bizarre digressions into satirical comedy. An audience member is chosen as \"Secretary\" and has the job of keeping a note of the topics covered on a white board. In practice, the personality of the secretary will also prompt many jokes – usually at his or her expense. At the end of the show, Skinner asks either the secretary or the audience to choose between two song books, and to pick a page number between 1 and 20. This process determines which song is performed by the duo, sung by Skinner with Baddiel accompanying him on piano (or, on at least one occasion, semi-acoustic guitar).\n\nTopics of discussion are wholly mandated by the audience and have ranged from discussions of the war against Iraq and other political events to comments on the latest plot twists of popular soap operas and the Atkins diet. Skinner's Catholicism and Baddiel's Jewish culture are also occasional targets of humour (Baddiel describing Skinner's faith as being \"insane\" and Skinner often using a music-hall Jewish accent to hold mock dialogues among members of Baddiel's extended family, as well as both performers demonstrating how to \"play the piano in a convincingly Jewish manner\").\n\nTo avoid it becoming too similar to the pair's other show, Fantasy Football League, an unofficial rule was introduced to prevent discussion of football-related topics.\n\nSeries overview\n\nEpisodes\n\nOther versions\n\nIn 2004, a similar series, with Australian comedy duo Merrick & Rosso, aired in Australia - Merrick and Rosso Unplanned.\n\nOther 'unplanned' content\nBaddiel & Skinner produced a series of podcasts covering the 2006 FIFA World Cup for Avalon Television and The Times.\n\nA special edition for Comic Relief called Baddiel & Skinner unplanned & unpaid was done in front of a celebrity audience in 2001.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n .\n Off the telly Extended review of series one.\n\n2000s British television talk shows\n2000s British comedy television series\n2000 British television series debuts\n2005 British television series endings\nITV comedy\nTelevision series by ITV Studios\nEnglish-language television shows", "machine_text": "Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned is a British television show that aired from 2000 to 2005. The show features comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner engaging in improvised and unscripted conversations with a live audience. The show was broadcast on ITV, and became popular due to the pair's humorous banter and unpredictable interactions with their guests. The show was initially created as a one-off special in 2000, but its popularity led to six further series being commissioned. Over the years, many celebrities appeared on the show including Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, and Whoopi Goldberg. The format was largely unstructured, with Baddiel and Skinner taking suggestions from the audience and discussing a range of topics from current affairs to personal anecdotes. Baddiel and Skinner were well-known as a comedy duo prior to Unplanned, having previously worked together on the hit show Fantasy Football League. Unplanned showcased their witty and irreverent style in a more spontaneous format, and cemented their place as some of the UK's most beloved comedians. The show received critical acclaim and was nominated for a BAFTA award in 2001. It was also one of the first UK television shows to incorporate live Twitter feeds into the broadcast. Despite its success, the show was cancelled in 2005, with Baddiel and Skinner announcing that they wanted to end the series on a high note. Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned remains a popular and influential show in the UK comedy canon.

Bart, Lisa, and Groundskeeper Willie go back to the water park to free the whale trapped in it, with Bart finally understanding altruism and liking it.

But when they return to the pier, the boat starts sinking and Raphael offers his help as a mechanic while Bart is sharing a plan with Milhouse to free other animals in his newfound spirit of altruism.\n\nHomer offers Lenny and Carl to share the boat, and the expenses to fix it. Bart and Milhouse go to the Springfield Zoo and free a gorilla named Lolo, but he goes on a rampage while Milhouse narrowly escapes getting eaten by two tigers.\n\nBart calls Lisa for help since the police are useless on capturing Lolo. Homer starts co-owning the boat with even more people and the boat sinks due to the weight. Lolo rampages at the Springfield Elementary School and Lisa stops him using Seinfeld to calm him down.\n\nLisa takes Lolo home to help him go back to a life of freedom and takes him to Dr. Jane Goodall at the Pennsylvania Ape Reserve where he will be loved.

The Simpsons’ world is made up of outlandish situations rendered possible, sometimes even plausible, by animation and the show's forgiving rules of reality.

The phrase is often used in a political context, where a particular party or group establishes a strong hold on government, but it can be applied to other situations as well. The term \"Gorillas on the Mast\" comes from the idea that gorillas are the dominant species in their natural habitat and that they are known for their strength and power. The use of this phrase has a long history that can be traced back to the early 20th century. During this time, it was used to describe the dominance of certain political parties in different countries, particularly in Europe. In the post-World War II period, the phrase became more widespread and began to be used to describe the dominance of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. Today, the phrase continues to be used to describe situations where one group or organization has a strong hold on power. It can be applied to many different situations, including corporate monopolies, political totalitarianism, or even social movements that seek to impose their will on others. Regardless of the context in which it is used, the phrase \"Gorillas on the Mast\" carries a certain connotation of strength and power. It suggests that those in control have the ability to shape the course of events and exercise significant influence over the lives of others.

The car was known by its name Typ 320 at the time of its production and service, but is in retrospect commonly referred to using its Mercedes-Benz works number, \"W142\", which gives a more unambiguously unique nomenclature.\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 n (Works number W142/I)  1937–1938 \nThe standard-wheelbase version of the W142 shared its  wheelbase with the standard lengthened versions of its predecessor, but a more streamlined form with longer overhangs meant that even in this form the W142 was substantially longer and indeed wider than the earlier car. The front grill was gently raked backwards, and there was no longer a bar in front of it to carry lights, all of which gave the car a more sporting look than the model it replaced.\n\nPower came from a newly enlarged straight six 3,208 cc side-valve engine with a listed maximum output of  at 4,000 rpm, supporting a claimed top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). This was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which, unusually in the 1930s, incorporated synchromesh on all four ratios. The footbrake used a hydraulic control mechanism and operated on all four wheels. The suspension set-up was carried over from the W18 with a swing axle at the rear and the front axle suspended with a central transverse leaf spring and coil springs beside the wheels.\n\nCustomers wishing to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a standard-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,500 Marks. Otherwise the choice of standard bodies was restricted to a three-seat cabriolet (known as the \"Cabriolet A\") or a coupé-bodied equivalent with a removable roof, priced respectively at 11,800 Marks or 12,300 Marks.\n\nMercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/II)  1937–1938 \nLonger-bodied cars came with an extra  of wheelbase, and Mercedes-Benz offered a choice from a wide range of standard body options for the longer cars.\n\nCustomers happy to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a longer-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,800 Marks, or 300 Marks more than the price of the shorter chassis.

Other soft-topped standard-bodied versions were a Torpedo-bodied 6-seater \"Tourenwagen\" and a sporty 2-seater Roadster. There was also a six-seater “Pullman-Limousine” with three rows of seats and six side windows under a conventional steel roof.

Instead the compression ratio was lowered in anticipation of future shortages enforcing the use of fuel synthesized from coal which was expected to have a lower octane rating than the “normal” fuel used at the time.

Their Young and Beilby patent retort was patented in 1882.\n\nIn 1892, Beilby patented a production method for hydrogen cyanide. This new method used ammonia and coal as starting materials and was able to meet the rising demands on sodium cyanide for the gold leaching by the MacArthur-Forrest process. He became director of the profitable Cassel Cyanide Company and then became a director of the Castner-Kellner Company at Runcorn, for whom he developed their new Wallsend factory.\n\nOrganisational affiliations and honours\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1906.

Born on 13 April 1850 in Edinburgh, Beilby began his scientific career as an apprentice to his father, a manufacturing chemist. He later went on to study chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. In 1874, he was appointed professor of chemistry at Anderson's University (now the University of Strathclyde). Beilby's early research was focused on photographic chemistry, particularly on the effect of light on silver halides. He also developed a method of making photographic plates with a hard gelatine coating, which was more durable and had a longer shelf life than previous methods. In 1888, Beilby turned his attention to the problem of producing high-quality mirrors. At that time, mirrors were made by coating a glass surface with a layer of molten metal, usually silver. However, the resulting mirrors were often distorted or clouded. Beilby discovered that by pre-treating the glass surface with hydrofluoric acid, he could create a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the surface. This layer prevented the metal from bonding too strongly with the glass and allowed it to form a smooth, even layer. This technique became known as the \"Beilby Layer\" and revolutionized the mirror-making industry. In addition to his work on photographic chemistry and the Beilby Layer, Beilby made other contributions to science and industry. He was involved in the development of the coal tar chemical industry, which produced synthetic dyes and pharmaceuticals. He also served as president of the Chemical Society of London from 1906 to 1908. Beilby received many honors during his lifetime, including the Davy Medal from the Royal Society in 1895 and a knighthood in 1902.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Betty Hutton\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Betty Hutton (born Elizabeth June Thornburg; February 26, 1921 – March 12, 2007)\nwas an American stage, film, and television actress, comedian, dancer, and singer.\n\nEarly life and education\nHutton was born Elizabeth June Thornburg on February 26, 1921, in Battle Creek, Michigan. While she was very young, her father abandoned the family for another woman. They did not hear of him again until they received a telegram in 1937, informing them of his suicide. Betty and her older sister, Marion, were raised by her alcoholic mother, who took the surname Hutton.  Marion was later billed as the actress Sissy Jones.\n\nThe three started singing in the family's speakeasy when Betty was 3 years old. Troubles with the police kept the family on the move.  They eventually landed in Detroit, where she attended Foch Intermediate School. On one occasion, when Betty, preceded by a police escort, arrived at the premiere of Let's Dance (1950), her mother, arriving with her, quipped, \"At least this time the police are in front of us!\"  Hutton sang in several local bands as a teenager, and at one point visited New York City hoping to perform on Broadway, where she was rejected.\n\nEarly career\nA few years later, she was scouted by orchestra leader Vincent Lopez, who gave Hutton her entry into the entertainment business.\n\nShe appeared in several musical shorts for Warner Bros., Queens of the Air (1938), Three Kings and a Queen (1939), Public Jitterbug No. 1 (1939), and One for the Book (1940).\n\nBroadway\nHutton was cast in a Broadway show, Two for the Show (1940), which ran for 124 performances.\n\nThe show was produced by Buddy DeSylva, who then cast Hutton in Panama Hattie (1940–42). This was a major hit, running for 501 performances. It starred Ethel Merman; despite rumors through the years that Merman demanded from envy that Hutton's musical numbers be reduced from the show, more careful reports demonstrate that producer Buddy DeSylva chose to cut just one song of three, \"They Ain't Done Right by Our Nell\", due to Hutton's \"always in overdrive\" performance style.\n\nParamount\n\nEarly films\nWhen DeSylva became a producer at Paramount Pictures, Hutton was signed to a featured role in The Fleet's In (1942), starring Paramount's number-one female star Dorothy Lamour, alongside Eddie Bracken and William Holden. The film was popular and Hutton was an instant hit with the moviegoing public.\n\nHutton was one of the many Paramount contract artists who appeared in Star Spangled Rhythm (1942). The studio did not immediately promote her to major stardom, but did give her the second lead in a Mary Martin film musical, Happy Go Lucky (1943). The response was positive, and Hutton was given co-star billing with Bob Hope in Let's Face It (1943). During that year, she made $1250 per week.\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan's Creek\nIn 1942, writer-director  Preston Sturges cast Betty as the dopey but endearing small-town girl who gives local troops a happy send-off and wakes up married and pregnant, but with no memory of who her husband is, except that  a few \"z's\" were in his name.  This film, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, was delayed by Hays Office objections and Sturges' prolific output, and was finally released early in 1944.\n\nThe film made Hutton a major star;  Sturges was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar, the film was named to the National Film Board's Top Ten films for the year, and the National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture of 1944, and awarded Betty Hutton the award for Best Acting for her performance. The New York Times named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942–1944.\n\nCritic James Agee noted that \"the Hays office must have been raped in its sleep\" to allow the film to be released. And although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of the film's subject matter, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1944, playing to standing room-only audiences in some theatres.\n\nParamount kept Hutton busy, putting her in And the Angels Sing (1944) with Fred MacMurray and Dorothy Lamour, and Here Come the Waves (1944) with Bing Crosby. Both were huge hits.\n\nOn the strength of Hutton's success,  she signed a recording contract with the newly formed  Capitol Records (she was one of the earliest artists to do so).\n\nBuddy DeSylva, one of Capitol's founders, also co-produced her next hit, the musical Incendiary Blonde (1945), where she played Texas Guinan. It was directed by veteran comedy director George Marshall and Hutton had replaced Lamour as Paramount's top female box-office attraction.\n\nHutton was one of many Paramount stars in Duffy's Tavern (1945), and was top billed in The Stork Club (1945) with Barry Fitzgerald, produced by DeSyvla.\n\nHutton went into Cross My Heart (1946) with Sonny Tufts, which she disliked. She did however enjoy the hugely popular The Perils of Pauline (1947), directed by Marshall, where she sang a Frank Loesser song that was nominated for an Oscar: \"I Wish I Didn't Love You So\".\n\nHutton's relationship with Paramount began to disintegrate when DeSylva left the studio due to illness (he died in 1950). \"After I left I started doing scripts that I knew weren't good for me.\"\n\nHutton made Dream Girl (1948) with MacDonald Carey, which she later said, \"almost ruined me.\" She did Red, Hot and Blue (1949) with Victor Mature, which she also disliked.\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun\n\nHutton's next screen triumph came in Annie Get Your Gun (1950) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which hired her to replace Judy Garland in the role of Annie Oakley. The film, with the leading role retooled for Hutton, was a smash hit, with the biggest critical praise going to Hutton.\n\nShe was billed above Fred Astaire in the 1950 musical Let's Dance. \n\nHutton was one of several stars in The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). She made an unbilled cameo in Sailor Beware (1952) with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, a remake of The Fleet's In, in which she portrayed Dean's girlfriend, Hetty Button.\n\nShe made Somebody Loves Me (1952), a biography of singer Blossom Seeley, with Ralph Meeker.\n\nHutton then clashed with Paramount. The New York Times reported that the dispute resulted from her insistence that her husband at the time, choreographer Charles O'Curran, direct her in a film.\n\nIn April 1952, Hutton returned to Broadway, performing in Betty Hutton and Her All-Star International Show.\n\nIn July 1952, she announced her husband and she would form a production company. She left Paramount in August.\n\nTelevision and theatre\nHutton got work in radio, appeared in Las Vegas, where she had a great success.\n\nShe had the rights to a script about Sophie Tucker, but was unable to raise funds.\n\nIn 1954, TV producer Max Liebman, of comedian Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, fashioned his first \"Color Spectacular\" as an original musical written especially for Hutton, Satins and Spurs.\n\nHutton's last completed film was a small one, Spring Reunion (1957). It was a financial disappointment. She also became disillusioned with Capitol's management and moved to RCA Victor.\n\nIn 1957, she appeared on a Dinah Shore show on NBC that also featured Boris Karloff; the program has been preserved on a kinescope.\n\nThe Betty Hutton Show\nLucille Ball and Desi Arnaz took a chance on Hutton in 1959, with their company  Desilu Productions giving her a CBS sitcom, The Betty Hutton Show. Hutton hired the still-blacklisted and future film composer Jerry Fielding to direct her series. They had met over the years in Las Vegas when he was blacklisted from TV and radio and could get no other work, and her Hollywood career was also fading. It was Fielding's first network job since losing his post as musical director of Groucho Marx's You Bet Your Life in 1953 after hostile questioning by HUAC. The Betty Hutton Show ended after 30 episodes.\n\nHutton continued headlining in Las Vegas and touring across the country. She returned to Broadway briefly in 1964 when she temporarily replaced a hospitalized Carol Burnett in the show Fade Out – Fade In.\n\nShe guest-starred on shows such as The Greatest Show on Earth, Burke's Law, and Gunsmoke.\n\nIn 1967, she was signed to star in two low-budget Westerns for Paramount, but was fired shortly after the projects began.\n\nLife after Hollywood\n\nAfter the 1967 death of her mother in a house fire, and the collapse of her last marriage, Hutton's depression and pill addictions escalated. She divorced her fourth husband, jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli, when she discovered he had fallen in love with Edie Adams (who would become Candoli's second wife).  She declared bankruptcy the same year.\n\nAfter losing her singing voice in 1970, Hutton had a nervous breakdown and later attempted suicide. She regained control of her life through rehabilitation, and the mentorship of a Roman Catholic priest, Father Peter Maguire. Hutton converted to Roman Catholicism, and took a job as a cook at a rectory in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. She made national headlines when it was revealed she was practically penniless and working in a rectory. After an aborted comeback in 1974, she was hospitalized with emotional exhaustion. Later that year, a well-publicized \"Love-In for Betty Hutton\" was held at New York City's Riverboat Restaurant, emceed by comedian Joey Adams, with several old Hollywood pals on hand. The event raised $10,000 for Hutton and gave her spirits a big boost, but steady work still eluded her.\n\nHutton appeared in an interview with Mike Douglas and a brief guest appearance in 1975 on Baretta. In 1977, Hutton was featured on The Phil Donahue Show. She was then happily employed as hostess at a Newport, Rhode Island, jai alai arena.\n\nShe also appeared on Good Morning America, which led to a 1978 televised reunion with her two daughters. Hutton began living in a shared home with her divorced daughter and grandchildren in California, but returned to the East Coast for a three-week return to the stage.\n\nAnnie\nIn 1980, she took over the role of Miss Hannigan during the original Broadway production of Annie while Alice Ghostley was on vacation. Ghostley replaced the original Miss Hannigan actress, Dorothy Loudon (who won a Tony Award for the role).\n\nHutton's rehearsal of the song \"Little Girls\" was featured on Good Morning America. Hutton's Broadway comeback was also included in a profile on CBS News Sunday Morning about her life, her struggle with pills, and her recovery.\n\nA ninth-grade drop-out, Hutton went back to school and earned a master's degree in psychology from Salve Regina University in 1986. During her time at college, Hutton became friends with singer-songwriter Kristin Hersh and attended several early concerts of Hersh's band, Throwing Muses.  Hersh later wrote the song \"Elizabeth June\" as a tribute to her friend, and wrote about their relationship in further detail in her memoir, Rat Girl.\n\nHutton's last known performance, in any medium, was on Jukebox Saturday Night, which aired on PBS in 1983. Hutton stayed in New England and began teaching comedic acting at Boston's Emerson College. She became estranged again from her daughters.\n\nFinal years\nAfter the death of her ally, Father Maguire, Hutton returned to California, moving to Palm Springs in 1999, after decades in New England. Hutton hoped to grow closer to her daughters and grandchildren, as she told Robert Osborne on TCM's Private Screenings in April 2000, though her children remained distant. She told Osborne that she understood their hesitancy to accept a now elderly mother. The TCM interview first aired on July 18, 2000. The program was rerun as a memorial on the evening of her death in 2007, and again on July 11, 2008, April 14, 2009, January 26, 2010, and as recently as March 18, 2017. as part of TCM's memorial tribute for Robert Osborne.\n\nHutton lived in Palm Springs until her death March 12, 2007, at 86, from colon cancer complications. She is buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nHutton's first marriage was to camera manufacturer Ted Briskin in 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1951. Two daughters were born to the couple:\n Lindsay Diane Briskin, born in Barcelona, Spain, on March 1, 1946\n Candice Elizabeth Briskin, born in Havana, Cuba, on December 3, 1947\n\nHutton's second marriage in 1952 was to choreographer Charles O'Curran. They divorced in 1955. He died in 1984.\n\nShe married husband Alan W. Livingston in 1955, weeks after her divorce from O'Curran. They divorced in 1960.\n\nHer fourth and final marriage in 1960 was to jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. They divorced in 1967. Hutton and Candoli had one child:\n Carolyn Candoli, born on March 9, 1961\n\nHutton was once engaged to the head of the Warner Bros. makeup department, makeup artist Perc Westmore, in 1942, but broke off the engagement, saying it was because he bored her.\n\nLegacy\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Betty Hutton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6259 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHit songs\n\nFilmography\n\nBox-office ranking\nFor several years, film exhibitors voted Hutton among the leading stars in the country:\n 1944 – 25th (US)\n 1950 – 15th (US)\n 1951 – 9th (UK)\n 1952 – 14th (US), 3rd (UK)\n\nStage work\n Two for the Show (1940)\n Panama Hattie (1940)\n Betty Hutton and Her All-Star International Show (1952)\n Gypsy (1962)\n South Pacific (1962)\n Annie Get Your Gun (1963)\n Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1964)\n Fade Out – Fade In (1964) (replacement for Carol Burnett)\n Mary, Mary (1965)\n Here Today (1966)\n Here Today (1972)\n Anything Goes (1973)\n Annie (1980) (replacement for Alice Ghostley)\n\nRadio appearances\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nIn popular culture\n\nHer songs \"He's a Demon - He's a Devil - He's a Doll\" and \"It's a Man\" are featured in the open-world video game, Fallout 4, on the in-game radio.\n\nHer song \"Murder, He Says\" appeared in Woody Allen's 1989 film, Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Betty Hutton, Backstage You Can Have: My Own Story, 2009.

Earth is the same as it was in the late 19th century, but only the United Kingdom and its Empire possess the engines to travel across the solar system. The United States, which the British consider to be rebellious colonies, and France, though not technically at war with Britain on Earth, are in a struggle to sabotage the Britons' expansive interests and develop space technology of their own.\nLondon, the centre of the universe, has many spaceports and is the base of many organisations such as the Royal Xenological Society.\n\nLarklight \n\nLarklight is the first book in the series. The story begins in the Larklight manor where they have a visitor. However, soon, white spiders from Saturn invade Larklight and they have to save the known universe from a madman.\n\nStarcross \n\nStarcross, the second book in the trilogy begins when Art Mumby and his prim older sister Myrtle, at their home (Larklight) with their mother and father, receive a strange invitation to the Starcross hotel, located in the asteroid field.\n\nMothstorm \n\nMothstorm, the third book and the last book in the trilogy, was published in hardback in October 2008.

The movie would have been released in 2010. It is unknown if the rest of the trilogy will be adapted. However Shekhar Kapur said Larklight will be the last expensive movie he will make, so it is unlikely that Starcross and Mothstorm will be adapted unless another director chooses to do so.\n\nThe film was planned to be released January 1, 2010, but after the death of director Anthony Minghella, Shekhar Kapur took over his unfinished movie, New York, I Love You, and Larklight had to be postponed.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Review at Kidsreads.com\n\n \nBook series introduced in 2006\nNovels by Philip Reeve\nNovel series\nAlternate history novels\nFantasy books by series\nSteampunk novels\nFantasy novel trilogies\nScience fiction novel trilogies", "machine_text": "Larklight trilogy is a series of young adult science fiction adventure novels written by British author, Philip Reeve.

The trilogy consists of Larklight (2006), Starcross (2007), and Mothstorm (2008). Larklight introduces readers to the Mumby family - siblings Arthur and Myrtle and their widowed father - living on the outskirts of the British Empire. They live in a manor house that serves as the moon's first space station. Their peaceful existence is interrupted when they come across a villainous plot to turn the moon into a giant cannon to attack Earth. They must race against time to stop the evil space fowlers who intend to aim the cannon at the planet. In Starcross, the Mumbys find themselves embroiled in another intergalactic adventure. Set aboard the British-built space liner, the Euphrosyne, the Mumbys discover an assassination conspiracy aboard the ship and are once again caught up in a race to save the planet from an ecologically devastating disaster. The concluding novel, Mothstorm, brings the trilogy to an explosive finale. Myrtle and Arthur must travel to a parallel dimension to save their father who has been kidnapped by a group of monsters known as the Moth-Men. The Larklight trilogy is an engaging young adult series that combines adventure, comedy, and a lushly realized alternate universe. The novels are all heavily influenced by the works of Jules Verne and H.G Wells, embodying a Victorian steampunk aesthetic.

He was also a poet, critic and film lyricist.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education\nAli Sardar Jafri was born in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh, where he spent his formative years.\n\nHis early influences were Mir Anees and Josh Malihabadi. In 1933, he was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) where he soon got exposed to Communist ideology and in 1936 he was expelled from the University for 'political reasons'. However, he graduated in 1938 from Zakir Husain College (Delhi College), Delhi University, but his subsequent postgraduate studies at Lucknow University ended prematurely following his arrest during 1940–41 for writing anti-War poems, and for taking part in political activities organised by the Indian National Congress as Secretary of the university's Students' Union.\n\nLiterary career\nJafri embarked on his literary career in 1938 with the publication of his first collection of short stories called Manzil (Destination). His first collection of poems  Parvaz (Flight) was published in 1944. In 1936, he presided over the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Movement in Lucknow. He also presided over their subsequent assemblies for the rest of his life.<ref> Frontline, Volume 17 – Issue 17, 19 August – 1 September 2000.</ref> In 1939, he became co-editor of Naya Adab, a literary journal devoted to the Progressive Writers' Movement which continued to be published until 1949.\n\nHe was involved in several social, political and literary movements. On 20 January 1949, he was arrested at Bhiwandi, for organising a (then banned) Progressive Urdu writers' conference, despite warnings from Morarji Desai, the Chief Minister of Bombay State; three months later, he was rearrested.\n\nHis important works as a lyricist include Dharti Ke Lal (1946) and Pardesi (1957) .

The prime minister had invited Jafri to accompany him on this trip but ill health prevented him from doing so. Sarhad is also an audio album dedicated to Indo-Pakistan amity produced by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal and composed and sung by \"Bulbul-e-Kashmir\" Seema Anil Sehgal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made history when he presented Sarhad, as a national gift, to the then prime minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, during the historic Lahore Summit, 20–21 February 1999. It was also a milestone in Jafri's life.\n\nIn the course of his literary career spanning five decades, Jafri also edited anthologies of Kabir, Mir, Ghalib and Meera Bai with his own introductions. He also wrote two plays for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), produced a documentary film Kabir, Iqbal and Freedom and two television serials: the runaway success, the 18-part Kahkashan, based on the lives and works of six Urdu poets of the 20th century he had known personally viz.Firaq Gorakhpuri, Josh Malihabadi, Majaz, Hasrat Mohani, Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Jigar Moradabadi; and Mehfil-e-yaaran  in which he interviewed people from different walks of life.

Reginald de Dike of Cranbrook was Sheriff of Kent in 1355. Thomas Dyke (d.1632) of Cranbrook married Joan Walsh,  heiress of the manor of Horeham in the parish of Waldron in Sussex, which thus passed to the Dykes. The Dyke Baronetcy, of Horeham in the County of Sussex, was created in 1677 for Thomas Dyke, Commissioner of Public Accounts and a Member of Parliament for Sussex and East Grinstead. \n\nThomas Dyke (1591-1672) of Tetton, who married a certain Anna (1598-1630).

He married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Pepys, a daughter of John Pepys (1576-1652) of Ashtead and sister and eventual co-heiress of Edward Pepys. Without progeny. Secondly to Joanna Deane, possibly his servant, by whom he had an illegitimate son called Thomas Deane, of the Inner Temple, who later adopted his father's surname of Dyke, and died without progeny. \nThomas Dyke (d.1745) of Tetton. He was one of the sons of Edward I Dyke (will dated 1728) of Pixton, Somerset, by his wife Elizabeth Blackford (d.1736), a daughter of Richard Blackford of Dunster, Master in Chancery, and heiress of her cousin Henrietta Blackford (1725-1733), heiress of Holnicote.\nElizabeth Dyke (d.1753), daughter and sole heiress.

Edward's portrait survives in Dunster Castle. Elizabeth Dyke thus brought to her husband the estates of Tetton, Holnicote and Pixton, \"a splendid dowry\" worth about £30,000, and extending into 24 parishes. According to the marriage settlement Elizabeth and her husband were obliged to adopt the additional surname of Dyke.\n\nAcland\n\nThe Acland family originated in the 12th century at the estate of Acland, from which they took their name,  in the parish of Landkey, North Devon. In the opinion of the Devon historian Hoskins (1981), based on the family's early and repeated use of the Flemish firstname of Baldwin, the Acland  family probably  migrated to England from Flanders soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066.  Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591 – 1647)  moved his residence from Acland to Columb John, near Exeter, the former seat of his great-uncle Sir John Acland (died 1620), and soon after the family moved again to the adjoining estate  of Killerton where they built a grand country house, today the property of the National Trust.\n\nSir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1722–1785), who in 1745 married Elizabeth Dyke, the heiress of Holnicote, Pixton and Tetton.

He served as Member of Parliament for Devon, 1746–1747, for Somerset, 1767–1768, and was High Sheriff of Somerset in 1751. He was a prominent member of the Westcountry gentry, and a famous staghunter who used as his hunting seats his wife's  Exmoor estates of Pixton and Holnicote. He kept his own pack of hounds, which had formerly been kept by the Dykes. He became forester or ranger of Exmoor under grant from the Crown and \"hunted the country in almost princely style. Respected and beloved by all the countryside, he was solicited at the same time to allow himself to be returned as member of Parliament for the counties of Devon and Somerset. He preferred, however, the duties and pleasures of life in the country, where he bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman\".\n\nHerbert\n\nHenry George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon (1772-1833), who inherited Tetton and Pixton as part of the marriage settlement on his marriage in 1796 to Elizabeth \"Kitty\" Acland, daughter of John Dyke Acland (1746-1778) by his wife Lady Harriet Fox-Strangways   (1750-1815), a daughter of Stephen Fox-Strangways, 1st Earl of Ilchester (1704-1776).

In September 2011 the gallery announced Amanda Coulson, as the new Director and 4 new staff appointments. John Cox joined the gallery in January 2012 as Chief Curator.\n\nThe National Art Gallery of The Bahamas (NAGB) was the first institution of its kind in the history of The Bahamas, announced in 1996, by then-Prime Minister, Hubert A. Ingraham, as part of a larger expanded system of museums that would record, preserve and historicize the narrative of the independent sovereign nation, established in 1973.\n\nThe NAGB is housed in the historic Villa Doyle (see below) situated on West and West Hill Streets, in Historic Charles Towne and on the border of Delancy Town, and is within easy walking distance of Downtown Nassau’s port and main business quarter. It physically bridges the two districts that are at the core of the nation: bustling Downtown—the hub of colonial power and continued wealth through commerce and tourism—and the ‘Over-the-Hill’ community—also known as the ‘nation’s navel’—where the Majority Rule leaders were born and raised. Sadly, once a thriving middle class community, the latter is now considerably diminished.\n\nThe museum boasts four gallery spaces—the PE, or permanent exhibition space, on the ground floor, which houses rotating shows drawn on the National Collection; The PS Room, a project space for monthly interventions, also on the ground floor; and two temporary exhibition spaces on the second floor (T1 and T2).\n\nThe NAGB is partially funded by a governmental subvention but engages a public-private network to operate and is also supported by the community that it serves, in the form of ticket sales, memberships, donations and otherwise.\n\nThe museum is housed in the Villa Doyle, a mansion built in the 1860s as the home to first Chief Justice in The Bahamas. After the addition of a new wing in the 1920s, it became one of Nassau’s prized stately homes. Positioned on the rise overlooking the top of West Street, Villa Doyle is typical of great houses of earlier centuries with surrounding verandahs.\n\nLeft to wrack and ruin in the modern age, many argued for its demolition to obliterate the reminder of our colonial past. Under a campaign lead by historian and founding Chairman, Dr. Gail Saunders, the building was saved as a site where history could be recognized, unpacked and interpreted. The building was subsequently restored in the 1990s to become the NAGB.\n\nVilla Doyle’s restoration took almost seven years to complete involving a team of professionals and consultants under the supervision of architect, Anthony Jervis; Civil Engineer, Mr. George Cox; and the National Art Gallery’s Committee chaired by Dr. Gail Saunders.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Gallery website\n\nArt museums established in 2003\nArt museums and galleries in the Bahamas\nBahamas\n2003 establishments in the Bahamas", "machine_text": "The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas is a contemporary art museum located in Nassau, The Bahamas. It was established in 2003 by the Bahamian government to showcase and celebrate the art and culture of the country and the wider Caribbean region. The museum's collection features over six hundred works of art, including paintings, sculptures, and mixed media pieces. The collection includes works by Bahamian artists as well as those from other Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Cuba. The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas is housed in an impressive nineteenth-century neoclassical building known as Villa Doyle. The building was originally the private residence of Sir William Doyle, a prominent British businessman who lived on the island in the late 1800s. In 1924, the Bahamas government purchased Villa Doyle and converted it into the Governor's Official Residence, which it remained until 1995. After being restored, the building became the National Art Gallery of The Bahamas. The museum is divided into several galleries, showcasing different aspects of Bahamian art and culture. Some of these galleries include a Folk Art Gallery, a Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery, and a Special Exhibitions Gallery. The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas also offers educational programs and classes to the community. These programs aim to promote a better understanding and appreciation of Bahamian art and culture, as well as to foster creativity and artistic expression. The museum has become a popular cultural destination for locals and tourists alike, showcasing the rich and diverse artistic heritage of the Caribbean. The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas plays a crucial role in preserving and celebrating the artistic traditions of the region, and it continues to be an important institution for the promotion of contemporary art in the Caribbean.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14423826}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alan Menken\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Alan Irwin Menken (born July 22, 1949) is an American composer, songwriter, conductor, music director and record producer. Menken is best known for his scores and songs for films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. His scores and songs for The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and Pocahontas (1995) have each won him two Academy Awards. He also composed the scores and songs for Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Newsies (1992), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Home on the Range (2004), Enchanted (2007), and Tangled (2010), among others. His accolades include eight Academy Awards, a Tony Award, eleven Grammy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and a Daytime Emmy Award.\n\nHe is also known for his work in musical theater for Broadway and elsewhere. Some of these are based on his Disney films, but other stage hits include Little Shop of Horrors (1982), A Christmas Carol (1994), and Sister Act (2009).\n\nMenken has collaborated with such lyricists as Lynn Ahrens, Howard Ashman, Jack Feldman, Tim Rice, Glenn Slater, Stephen Schwartz, and David Zippel. With eight Academy Award wins, Menken is the second most prolific Oscar winner in the music categories after Alfred Newman, who has 9 Oscars. He has also won 11 Grammy Awards, a Tony Award, and a Daytime Emmy Award among many other honors. Menken is one of sixteen people to have won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony.\n\nEarly life \nAlan Irwin Menken was born on July 22, 1949, at French Hospital in Manhattan, to Judith and Norman Menken. His father was a boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist, and his mother was an actress, dancer and playwright. His family was Jewish. Menken developed an interest in music at an early age, taking piano and violin lessons. He began to compose at an early age. At age nine, at the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest, his original composition \"Bouree\" was rated Superior and Excellent by the judges.\n\nHe attended New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: \"I'd make up my own Bach fugues and Beethoven sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn't want to practice; so I'd go off on tangents\". He then enrolled at New York University. He graduated with a degree in Musicology in 1971 from the university's Steinhardt School.  Menken recalled: \"First, I was pre-med. I thought I'd be a dentist like my dad. Finally, I got a degree in music, but I didn't care about musicology. It wasn't until I joined BMI Workshop ... under Lehman Engel, and walked into a room with other composers that I knew this was it.\" Menken noted that \"Before college, I was writing songs to further my dream of being the next Bob Dylan. A lot of guitar songs – I was composing on piano before that.\" After college, he attended the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career \nAfter graduating, Menken's plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as Midnight, Apartment House (lyric by Muriel Robinson), Conversations with Pierre, Harry the Rat and Messiah on Mott Street (lyrics by David Zippel).\n\nAccording to Menken, during this period, he \"worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for Sesame Street and a vocal coach\". He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.\n\nIn 1976, John Wilson reported for The New York Times that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the \"Broadway at the Ballroom\" series: \"The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals.\" Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: \"In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing.\"\n\nMenken contributed material to revues like New York's Back in Town, Big Apple Country, The Present Tense (1977), Real Life Funnies (Off-Broadway, 1981), Diamonds (Off-Broadway, 1984), and Personals (Off-Off-Broadway, 1985). His revue Patch, Patch, Patch ran at the West Bank Cafe in New York City in 1979 and featured Chip Zien. The New York Times reviewer Mel Gussow wrote: \"The title song ... refers to a life's passage. According to Alan Menken ... after age 30 it is a downhill plunge.\"\n\nMenken wrote several shows that were not produced, including Atina, Evil Queen of the Galaxy (1980), with lyrics by Steve Brown. He also wrote The Thorn with lyrics by Brown, which was commissioned by Divine in 1980. This was a parody of the film The Rose, but they could not raise the money to have it produced. He collaborated with Howard Ashman in an uncompleted musical called Babe (c. 1981), with Tom Eyen in Kicks: The Showgirl Musical (1984), and with David Rogers in The Dream in Royal Street (c. 1981), which was an adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Menken contributed music for the film The Line (1980), directed by Robert J. Siegel.\n\nBreakthrough years \nMenken finally achieved success as a composer when playwright Howard Ashman chose him and Engel to write the music for his musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. The musical opened in 1979 at the WPA Theater to excellent reviews and modest box office. It transferred after several months to the Off-Broadway Entermedia Theater, where it ran for an additional six weeks.\n\nMenken and Ashman wrote their next musical, Little Shop of Horrors, for a cast of only 9 performers, including a puppeteer. This musical is based on the 1960 black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors. It opened at WPA Theater in 1982 to warm reviews. It moved to the Off Broadway Orpheum Theatre in the East Village, Manhattan, where it ran for five years. The musical set the box-office record for highest grossing Off-Broadway show of all time. It toured around the world, won theater awards and was adapted as a 1986 musical film starring Rick Moranis that earned Menken and Ashman their first Oscar nomination for the song \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\". For his body of work in musical theatre, he was awarded the BMI Career Achievement Award in 1983.\n\nIn 1987, Menken and lyricist David Spencer's adaptation The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, based on the 1959 novel of the same name, was produced in Philadelphia. After substantial re-writes, it was produced in 2015 in Montreal. In 1992, the WPA Theatre produced Menken's Weird Romance, also with lyrics by Spencer. Menken's musical based on the Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and book by Mike Ockrent, debuted at Madison Square Garden's Paramount Theater in 1994. The show proved successful and was an annual New York holiday event.\n\nDisney Renaissance and later films \nOn the strength of the success of Little Shop of Horrors, Menken and Ashman were hired by Walt Disney Studios to write the music for The Little Mermaid (1989). The challenge was to create an animated musical film of this Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that could sit alongside the Disney films Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. The Little Mermaid opened to critical and commercial success and signaled a new Disney era called the Disney Renaissance. The film gave them their first Oscar win: Best Song for the song \"Under the Sea\". Menken also won the 1989 Oscar for Best Score.\n\nMenken and Ashman's Beauty and the Beast garnered them three 1991 Oscar nominations for Best Song, winning for its title song. Menken won another Oscar for Best Score. The two were working on Aladdin at the time of Ashman's death in 1991. Ashman wrote only three songs in the film and Menken collaborated with Tim Rice, who was then working The Lion King, to write the rest of the songs for the film. The film won an Oscar in 1992 for Best Song: \"A Whole New World\". Menken also won the Oscar for Best Score. Menken's live action musical film Newsies, with lyrics by Jack Feldman, was released in 1992.\n\nThree more animated musical films followed. Menken collaborated with Stephen Schwartz for Pocahontas, for which the two won two Oscars: Best Song and Best Musical or Comedy Score. In 1996, the same musical team created the songs, and Menken, the score, for The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1997, Menken reunited with his early collaborator, David Zippel, for his last film in the era, Hercules.\n\nMenken also wrote the music for the Michael J. Fox vehicle Life with Mikey (1993), the holiday film Noel (2004) and Mirror Mirror (2012). His other film scores for Disney have included Home on the Range (2004), the Tim Allen remake of The Shaggy Dog (2006), Enchanted (2007), and Tangled (2010).\n\nIn March 2017, Disney released a live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon, with the songs from the 1991 film and new material by Menken and Rice. Menken collaborated with Benj Pasek and Justin Paul on writing new songs for the 2019 live-action version of Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie.\n\nMenken is also working on new music for a live-action film adaptation of The Little Mermaid, directed by Rob Marshall, with longtime The Little Mermaid fan Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom Menken knew since the former's childhood, as Miranda went to the same school as Menken's niece. Menken will also once again be working with Stephen Schwartz to write new songs for Disenchanted, the sequel to Enchanted, and for a remake of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which Menken will score. Menken is also working alongside former Disney chief creative officer John Lasseter on a project at Skydance Animation. On May 20 2020, the project was revealed to be Vicky Jenson's Spellbound. Menken will co-write songs for Spellbound alongside Glenn Slater, with whom he worked in Home on the Range and Tangled. Menken is also reportedly attached to a sequel to Aladdin.\n\nWith eight Academy Awards, only composer Alfred Newman (nine wins) and Walt Disney (22 wins) have received more Oscars than Menken. He is tied for third place with late costume designer Edith Head, and currently holds the record for the most wins for a living person.\n\nReturn to musical theatre \nMenken debuted on Broadway with a musical theatre adaptation of Beauty and the Beast that opened in 1994 and ran for 13 years before closing in 2007. In 1997, he collaborated with lyricist Tim Rice on a musical, King David, based on the biblical character, which was performed in a concert version on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Little Shop of Horrors played on Broadway from 2003 to 2004.\n\nHe next created the stage version of The Little Mermaid, which played on Broadway from 2008 to 2009 and for which he received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Score. Menken's stage adaptation of Sister Act premiered in London in 2009, and opened on Broadway in 2011. He was nominated for another Tony Award for Best Score. Menken received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010. In December 2010, he was a guest on the NPR quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!.\n\nIn 2012, Menken won a Tony Award for Best Score for his musical adaptation of Newsies, which ran until 2014. He also wrote the music for Leap of Faith, which had a brief run on Broadway in 2012. His stage adaptation of Aladdin opened on Broadway in 2014, earning him another Tony nomination for Best Score. In 2013, he was a guest at the annual Junior Theatre Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, and was honored with the Junior Theater Festival  Award. He gave a concert there, including music that was cut from various productions, while talking about his creative process.\n\nMenken's stage adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame played at La Jolla Playhouse, California, in 2014. The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was revived in Montreal in 2015, and A Bronx Tale: The Musical played at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 2016. Menken is currently working on stage musical adaptations of Night at the Museum and Animal Farm.\n\nAs of 2019, Menken is reuniting with his Newsies creators Jack Feldman and Harvey Fierstein to develop a new musical called Greetings from Niagara Falls. A reading was held in January 2019; however, there is no word on future plans for the project at this time.\n\nTelevision work \nFrom 1989 to 1990, Menken and Howard Ashman wrote songs for the popular puppet TV show Sesame Street. In 2008, Menken said that his work on Sesame Street was \"pathetic money, but it still had some prestige to it. It was on the air and [he] was getting some royalties\". The duo also wrote a song titled \"Wonderful Ways to Say No\" for the 1990 animated anti-drug special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.\n\nIn 2015, Menken co-composed the score for the musical television series Galavant alongside Christopher Lennertz, reuninting him with Tangled screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Menken also co-wrote songs for the series alongside Glenn Slater. The series lasted two seasons, first airing on January 4, 2015, and last airing on January 31, 2016. In 2017, Menken and Slater returned to write songs for the animated series Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure, which is set after the events of Tangled. The series ended in 2020, after three seasons. On July 26, 2020, Menken and Slater won the Daytime Emmy Award for Original Song in a Children's, Young Adult or Animated Program for the song titled \"Waiting in the Wings\".\n\nMenken is currently writing songs for a prequel/spin-off series to 2017's Beauty and the Beast titled Little Town, which will be centered on Gaston and LeFou. The series will be released on Disney's streaming service, Disney+. Menken will also be an executive-producer on the series.\n\nPersonal life\nMenken was introduced to ballet dancer Janis Roswick while working with the Downtown Ballet Company. They have been married since November 1972 and live in North Salem, New York. They have two daughters, Anna Menken and Nora Menken.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nMusicals \n\n Dear Worthy Editor (Off-Broadway, c.1974)\n  Book by Judy Menken\nBased on the letters-to-the-editor of Jewish-American newspaper Daily Jewish Forward\n Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (Off-Broadway, 1979)\n Lyrics by Howard Ashman\n Based on a 1965 novel by Kurt Vonnegut\n Little Shop of Horrors (Off-Broadway, 1982; West End, 1983; Broadway, 2003)\n Lyrics by Ashman\n Based on the 1960 black comedy film\n Weird Romance (Off-Broadway, 1992)\n Lyrics by David Spencer\n Two one-act musical: Based on \"Her Pilgrim Soul\" and \"The Girl Who Was Plugged In\"\n Beauty and the Beast (Broadway, 1994; West End, 1997)\n Lyrics by Ashman and Tim Rice\n Based on the 1991 Disney film\n A Christmas Carol (Madison Square Garden, 1994-2003)\n Lyrics by Lynn Ahrens\n Perennial holiday musical based on 1843 novella by Charles Dickens\n King David (Broadway, 1997)\n Lyrics by Rice\n Based on the Biblical books of Samuel, 1 Chronicles and Psalms\n Der Glöckner von Notre Dame (Berlin, 1999)\n Lyrics by Stephen Schwartz\n Based on the Disney film and the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo\n The Little Mermaid (Broadway, 2008)\n Lyrics by Ashman and Glenn Slater\n Based on the Disney film\nSister Act (West End, 2009; Broadway, 2011)\n Lyrics by Slater\n Based on the 1992 comedy film\n Leap of Faith (Broadway, 2012)\n Lyrics by Slater\n Based on the 1992 film\n Newsies (Paper Mill Playhouse, 2011; Broadway, 2012)\n Lyrics by Jack Feldman\n Based on the 1992 film\n Aladdin (Seattle, 2011; Broadway, 2014)\n Lyric by Ashman, Rice and Chad Beguelin\n Based on the 1992 film\n The Hunchback of Notre Dame (La Jolla Playhouse, 2014)\n Lyrics by Schwartz\n Based on the 1996 film and the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo\n The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (Montreal, 2015)\n Lyrics by Spencer\n Based on the 1959 novel by Mordecai Richler\n A Bronx Tale: The Musical (Broadway, 2016)\n Lyrics by Slater\n Based on the 1990 autobiographical one-man play by Chazz Palminteri\n Hercules (Central Park, 2019)\n Lyrics by David Zippel\n Based on the 1997 Disney film\n\nOther \n Aladdin, Jr. - 1-act, 7-scene musical adapted from the animated film Aladdin 1992\n Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage - Theatrical show at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Walt Disney World\n Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular - Theatrical show at Disney California Adventure Park\n The Hunchback of Notre Dame - Theatrical show at Disney's MGM Studios, Walt Disney World\n The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure - Attraction at Disney California Adventure Park\n Sindbad's Storybook Voyage featuring \"Compass of Your Heart\" - Attraction at Tokyo DisneySea, Tokyo Disney Resort\nDramatists Guild of America YouTube Channel music video featuring \"Someone Wrote That Song\"\n Tangled: The Musical - Theatrical show on the Disney Cruise Line (starting November 2015)\nDubai Parks and Resorts's official theme song \"All the Wonders of the Universe\" (opening October 2016)\n Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular 2017 celebration featuring the world premiere of \"The Sum of Us\" (lyrics by Jack Feldman) for soloist, chorus, and orchestra (Brian Stokes Mitchell, U.S. Army Soldier's Chorus and the Boston Pops Orchestra)\n\nAwards \n\nAlan Menken has received eight Academy Awards (and nineteen nominations), eleven Grammy Awards (and twenty-four nominations), one Tony Award (and four nominations), and one Daytime Emmy Award.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Albert Schultens\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Albert Schultens (; 22 August 168626 January 1750) was a Dutch philologist.\n\nBiography\nHe was born at Groningen, where he studied for the church. He went on to the University of Leiden, applying himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His thesis Dissertatio theologico-philologica de utilitate linguae Arabicae in interpretenda sacra lingua (\"The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture\") appeared in 1706. After a visit to Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his degree in theology (1709), he returned to Leiden, and devoted himself to the study of the manuscript collections there until 1711, when he became pastor at Wassenaer.\n\nHe disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the collegium theologicum, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden.\n\nSchultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens' treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine. Schultens vindicated the value of comparative study of the Semitic tongues against those who, like Jacques Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do.\n\nHis principal works were Institutiones ad Fundumenta Linguæ Hebraicæ (1737), Origines Hebraeae (2 vols., 1724, 1738), a second edition of which, with the De defectibus linguae Hebraeae (1731), appeared in 1761; Job (1737); Proverbs (1748); Vetus et regia via hebraezandi (1738); and Monumenta vetustiora Arabum (1740).

Born on September 21, 1686 in Groningen, Netherlands, Schultens showed an early interest in Biblical studies and Oriental languages. He studied theology and Semitic languages at the University of Leiden, where he was influenced by the teachings of the renowned Orientalist, Adriaan Reland. In 1713, Schultens was appointed as professor of Oriental languages at the University of Franeker, where he began his pioneering work in Hebrew studies. He published several influential works on Hebrew grammar, including \"Institutiones ad Fundamenta Linguae Hebraeae\" (1727), a comprehensive study of Hebrew roots, and \"Origines Hebraeae\" (1738-49), a monumental nine-volume work that traced the development of the Hebrew language from its earliest stages to modern times. Schultens was also an accomplished Arabic scholar and his work on the Arabic language played a significant role in the development of modern Arabic studies. He published several works on Arabic grammar and literature, including a seminal study on the Arabic poet Al-Mutanabbi. Schultens was highly regarded by his contemporaries for his scholarship and erudition. His work on the Hebrew language was groundbreaking and influenced many subsequent scholars, including the German linguist Wilhelm Gesenius. Albert Schultens died in Franeker on February 26, 1750, leaving behind a legacy of scholarly excellence and groundbreaking research in the field of Semitic languages.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mike Perry (artist)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Mike Perry is an American artist, illustrator, animator and curator. He is known for winning a Primetime Emmy Award for animation on Comedy Central's Broad City television show. His pop culture artwork, collaborative projects and communal work are often outside the standard art gallery sensibility. He works in a variety of media including illustration, animation, painting, type, magazines, videos, public art, sculpture, and books.\n\nEarly life \n\nPerry grew up outside of Kansas City, Missouri. After getting into trouble as an early teen, he discovered drawing and painting when his grandfather, a painter, gave him a tackle box filled with oil paints.\n\nPerry graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 2003 after changing his major from Art to Graphic Design. After he was rejected for an internship at the Walker Art Center, the museum's design director, Andrew Blauvelt, wrote a note suggesting he apply for a job at Urban Outfitters. Perry worked at the company's headquarters on digital media, publications, and catalog design for three years. He moved to Brooklyn in 2004 and in 2006 opened a studio.\n\nCareer \nMike Perry, a studio artist whose work is rooted in popular culture, \"is king\" of working in many mediums as an illustrator, typographer, sculptor, animator, painter, curator and producer. His fluorescent color, busy, organic and playful work looks \"like hand-drawn doodles,\" patterns and type.\n\nPerry's work from 2004 to 2011 was collected in the 2012 monograph for Rizzoli, Wondering Around Wandering. Excited about the publication and wanting to turn it into a bigger, communal and free event, he developed \"an unprecedented\" and \"unlikely\" three month long, pop-up community art space in a 7,000-square-foot warehouse in Crown Heights. Perry noted that his inspiration for the project, run by volunteers, came from the fact that \"he doesn’t see a lot of support or room for work like his in the galleries and institutions of today’s art world\"; Perry \"connected that attitude to an absence of more zine, print, and t-shirt shops — alternative spaces, essentially, that function so often as both communal and artistic (and commercial) loci.\" A Kickstarter campaign for the event raised $32,000 in a month. The community-centered space featured classes, workshops, performances and work by local artists. Seven hundred people came to the opening.\n\nHe has taught at Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis, Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Parsons School of Design in New York City.  A featured speaker at conferences, Perry has been interviewed extensively about the issues of working as a freelance artist. Brand consulting work as creative director and designer includes projects for The New York Times, Dolby, Jameson, the Tonight Show, Facebook, Microsoft, Honda and Insound. His many designs for brands include sneakers for Nike and custom glassware for Duvel.\n\nExhibitions \n\nSince 2007, Perry has been in over forty group and solo exhibitions worldwide. Solo shows includeThe Landscape Between Time & Space in London in 2008, and The Patterns Found in Space in New York at Giant Robot in 2009. Lost in the Discovery of What Shapes the Mind, 2010, covering 2,800-square-feet, was the first solo alumnus show at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In 2011, We Are the Infinity of Each Other and Color, Shapes, and Infinity were exhibited in Tokyo. A nude series, My Mother Caught Me Doodling, was shown at London's KK Outlet in 2014. His 2016 Intoxicating Pollen Wiggling in a Moist Journey of Constantly Blooming Tides at Garis & Hahn in New York, featuring abstract paintings of nudes and still lifes, led to a show of the same name inaugurating the gallery's Los Angeles location in 2017.\n\nGroup shows include The Fine Line in 2010; Walker Art Center's 2011 traveling installation Posterwall for the 21st Century, on the role digital art has played in design; Wondering Around Wandering in 2012; sculpture at the Corning Museum of Glass' Making Ideas: Experiments in Design at Glass Lab in 2013; WOW (Writing on Walls) in Belgium in 2016; and A Fantastic World in 2018.\n\nPerry has created and curated a number of public art installations for arts organizations and companies. In Brooklyn in 2013 he had several projects: street art on a construction site; a playground mural at the school P.S. 705; and his Crown Heights mural, a push back on the gentrification of the neighborhood where Perry's studio is located. In 2014, he created a mural for a Chipotle restaurant in Los Angeles, and a mural in Breda, the Netherlands, featuring a poem by Frank Nicholas, and later in 2015, he made a mural and installation for Facebook in New York. In 2016, Perry made one of New York City's largest rooftop murals in Brooklyn at the workspace a/d/o, and in 2017 he completed a multifloor mural in Cleveland incorporating a Tyehimba Jess poem.  His mural Wiggling Waves & Water Wanders went up in 2019 at Pier 17 in New York.\n\nAnimation \nPerry became more widely known for animating the titles for all seasons of the Comedy Central show Broad City and for animating the Mushrooms episode animation. He initially turned down the offer to do the titles, his \"first real animation project.\" Show stars and creators Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer described the Mushrooms episode as one of their favorites from the series’ entire run. Jacobson said the titles were “such a big part of the identity of Broad City.”  Mushrooms earned Perry and his team an Emmy Award for Outstanding Motion Design.\n\nBooks and Magazines \nIn collaboration with partner Anna Wolf, Perry started Untitled: (a fashion) Magazine in 2007, and in 2014, Tidal, a biannual print magazine focused on art and culture. His pop culture monographs include Pulled: A Catalog of Screen Printing and the career anthology Wondering Around Wandering: Work-So-Far. The collection My Mother Caught Me Doodling is from the show of the same name. What If My Dog Had Thumbs? is his first solo book for children.\n\nCuration \nSince 2011, Perry and artist Josh Cochran have been organizing a series of nude, two-day drawing marathons, #GetNudeGetDrawn, enlisting volunteers to model nude, initially organized using social media and Craigslist. The drawings are exhibited and sold at a pop-up exhibition immediately afterwards. Other past artist participants include Lisa Hanawalt, Deanne Cheuk, Jon Burgerman, Julia Rothman and Monica Ramos. In 2015, Perry created and curated an 820-foot-long mural with nine other artists, that was completed in one day.\n\nAwards and recognition \nPerry was chosen for Step Magazine's 30 under 30 in 2004, and named a groundbreaking illustrator by Computer Arts Projects Magazine in 2007. In 2008, he was selected by the Art Directors Club for Young Guns 6, and received Print Magazine's New Visual Artist award. In 2018, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Motion Design as Animation Director for the Broad City Mushrooms episode for Comedy Central and Jax Media.\n\nSelected work\n\nBibliography \n\n Hand Job: A Catalog of Hand-Drawn Type, Princeton Architectural Press, 2007, \n Over & Over: A Catalog of Hand-Drawn Patterns, Princeton Architectural Press, 2008, \n Iron Me On, Chronicle Books, 2009\n Pulled: A Catalog of Screen Printing, Princeton Architectural Press, 2011, \n I Heart Everything, Chronicle Books, 2011\n Wondering Around Wandering: Work-So-Far, Rizzolli NY, 2012, \n A Coloring Book by Mike Perry and YOU, Chronicle Books, 2012\n Type: Wall Decals by Mike Perry: 200 Peel-and-Stick Letters, Chronicle Books, 2012\n Unlimited Editions, Chronicle Books, 2012\n My Mother Caught Me Doodling, Mike Perry Studio, 2015\n Curios, Blurb, 2016\n The Broad City Coloring Book, Laurence King Publishing, 2017, \n Stoned Marker in Houston W/⁠ Chris, Melville Brand Design, 2018\n Z GOES FIRST: An Alphabet Story Z-to-A, illustrator, Sean Lamb, author, Imprint, 2018 \n Astro Baby, illustrator, Michelle Tea, author, Dottir Press, 2019, \n What If My Dog Had Thumbs?, Dottir Press, 2019,\n\nAnimation \n Behind Broad City - Animating the Mushrooms Episode, Comedy Central\n Ringo Starr, Jimmy Fallon & The Roots Sing Yellow Submarine (Classroom Instruments)\n\nMagazines \n Tidal Magazine, Design Director\n\nFilm \n Bill Stumpf's Comfort Criteria, Herman Miller]\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Mike Perry Studio Instagram\n Mike Perry Studio videos\n Mike Perry IMDB\n Abbi Jacobson in Conversation with Mike Perry\n\n1981 births\nAmerican animators\nAmerican male artists\nAmerican contemporary painters\n21st-century American painters\nAmerican art curators\nAmerican children's book illustrators\nAmerican cartoonists\nMinneapolis College of Art and Design alumni\nArtists from New York (state)\nArtists from Missouri\nLiving people", "machine_text": "Mike Perry (born September 1, 1981) is an American designer, artist, animator, author and creative director based in Brooklyn, New York.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chromatrope\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A chromatrope is a type of magic lantern slide that produces dazzling, colorful geometrical patterns set in motion by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions, originally with a double pulley mechanism but later usually with a rackwork mechanism.\n\nThe chromatrope was probably invented in the year 1841 (or slightly earlier) by English glass painter and showman Henry Langdon Childe, by which year it was listed in the Royal Polytechnic Institution catalogue. It was added as a novelty to the program of the Royal Polytechnic Institution, which had previously included many other types of magic lantern shows with moving images, such as phantasmagoria and dissolving views.\n\nThe principle and the effect of the chromatrope is similar to that of the feux pyriques that had gained some popularity in rich North European households at the end of the 18th century. The resulting abstract and everchanging image is also very similar to that of the kaleidoscope, which had caused an enormous international craze in 1818.\n\nReferences\n\nOptical toys", "machine_text": "Chromatrope is an optical toy that was popular in the 19th century. It was invented by William George Horner in 1839, and it consists of a cardboard disc with slits cut into it, which are covered with colored paper or gelatin. When the disc spins, the colors blend together to create a moving color pattern. The name Chromatrope comes from the Greek words “chroma”, meaning color, and “tropos”, meaning turn. The original Chromatropes were hand-painted with watercolors, but later versions used colored papers or gels. Chromatropes were often used in magic lantern shows, which were a form of entertainment popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A magic lantern was a projector that used a glass slide with an image painted on it, which would be projected onto a screen. Chromatropes provided a way to add color and movement to these shows. The popularity of Chromatropes declined with the advent of motion pictures, but they have continued to be used by artists and filmmakers. The use of Chromatropes in experimental film reached its height in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly with the work of Stan Brakhage, who used them in his film “Mothlight”. Today, Chromatropes are still made by toy and optical companies as novelties or collector’s items. They are also sometimes used in art installations and multimedia performances. In conclusion, Chromatrope is a simple yet innovative optical toy that has provided entertainment and inspiration for over a century. Its colorful patterns and movements continue to fascinate and inspire people today.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63664553}

As a footballer he played as an outside left and had a 16-year career in the Football League from 1950 to 1966. He came from a footballing family: brother Jack Grainger, brother-in-law Jim Iley, and first cousins Dennis Grainger, Jack Grainger and Edwin Holliday all played professionally. He got married in 1956 and has two children.\n\nRaised in the mining village of Havercroft, he was working as a car mechanic when he was signed on apprentice forms at Third Division North club Wrexham in July 1949. He turned professional the following year and made his first-team debut in February 1951. Though National Service prevented him from establishing himself at the club he still managed to build a reputation as an exciting young prospect and was purchased by Sheffield United for a £2,500 fee in June 1953. A regular in the starting eleven in the First Division, he was called up for the first of his seven England caps in May 1956. His international career lasted just 11 months, though he did score two goals against Brazil and one against West Germany. He was also twice selected for The Football League XI.\n\nHis career then declined as he struggled with an ankle injury sustained on England duty and he was sold on to Sunderland for £17,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at £6,000) in February 1957. Sunderland were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the 1957–58 season and he was sold on to Leeds United of the Second Division for a club record £15,000 in July 1960. His damaged ankle hindered his form at Leeds and he was sold on to Third Division side Port Vale in October 1961 for £6,000. He helped Vale to knock former club Sunderland out of the FA Cup the following January, but missed the end of the season with a groin injury that dogged him for the remainder of his time at Vale Park. He was not retained at the end of the 1963–64 season and signed with Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in August 1964. He made 41 appearances across the 1964–65 campaign, though was dropped the following season and was released in summer 1966. He then had a brief spell with Macclesfield Town in the Cheshire County League, before retiring to focus on his singing career. He later spent 1969 to 1972 as player-manager of non-league village team Newmillerdam, before playing for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978.\n\nGrainger performed his first professional music gig in 1956, supporting the Hilltoppers. He appeared on television and radio, and also had a ghostwritten column in the Sport Express. He was signed with the HMV label and released \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958. His footballing career restricted his singing opportunities, though he did share a bill with the Beatles in June 1963. He ended his singing career in August 1970 in order to focus on his new career in sales. He also supplemented his income scouting for a succession of clubs: Barnsley, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nEarly and personal life\nBorn in the mining village of Havercroft on 10 June 1933, his father – Daniel Grainger (1894–1967) – was a coal miner at Monckton Colliery. He had five older brothers: Leslie (born 1920), George (born 1922), Jack (born 1924), Eric (born 1926) and Horace (born 1929), though Leslie and George both died before he was born. His mother, Lily Grainger (née Holliday; 1900–79), gave birth to a total of seven children, with the one daughter also named Lily (born 1935). He represented Barnsley boys' team during the 1946–47 season, alongside future Munich air disaster victim Tommy Taylor and cricket umpire Dickie Bird. He attended Ryhill Junior, Ryhill Middle School, and then Felkirk Secondary School. After leaving school at the age of 15, he was employed as a car mechanic on wages that initially started on £1-a-week.\n\nGrainger came from a footballing family and his younger brother, Jack, spent ten years at Rotherham United just after World War II. His younger sister, Lily, went on to marry Jim Iley, who played as a wing-half for Sheffield United, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest. His cousin, also named Jack Grainger, played in the Football League for Barnsley and Southport in the 1930s. Jack's younger brother, Dennis, played for Leeds United and Wrexham in the late 1940s. Another cousin, Edwin Holliday, went on to represent England whilst playing for Middlesbrough in 1959.\n\nGrainger married Doreen Rowe on 3 January 1956. They had a son, Colin Junior, born on 3 July 1956. A daughter, Kim, followed on 27 February 1964. Grainger wrote his autobiography, The Singing Winger, which was published by deCoubertin Books on 17 October 2019.\n\nClub career\n\nWrexham\nGrainger spent his youth with South Elmsall Boys, before being invited for a trial at Wrexham in July 1949. He impressed Wrexham manager Les McDowall enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of £5-a-week. He spent the 1949–50 season playing for the reserve team in the Cheshire County League. McDowall moved on to manage Manchester City in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of Maine Road in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham. However he was called up for National Service in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the Royal Air Force. He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to £8-a-week, in addition to a £10 signing-on fee. He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking Billy Tunnicliffe's spot at outside-left in a Third Division North match against Hartlepools United at the Racecourse Ground, which ended in a 1–0 home victory. His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager Peter Jackson, and he failed to make an appearance in the 1951–52 season, before playing just four games of the 1952–53 campaign.\n\nSheffield United\nOn 27 June 1953, Grainger was signed by Second Division champions Sheffield United for a fee of £2,500. United manager Reg Freeman had signed his brother Jack at Rotherham United six years previously. He was placed on the maximum wage of £20-a-week and received a £10 signing-on fee. Demobbed from National Service in October, he made his first-team debut in a 1–1 draw with Charlton Athletic at Bramall Lane on 14 November, taking the place of Derek Hawksworth at outside-left. He played with his wrist in plaster as he suffered a fracture just before his demobilisation. He featured in only two further First Division matches in the 1953–54 season.\n\nHe scored his first goal in the Football League in a 4–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur on 30 October 1954, having got the better of right-back Alf Ramsey, with one journalist reporting that \"Ramsey never even attempted to match [Grainger] in speed\". He scored his second goal for the \"Blades\" in a 3–0 home win over Manchester United two weeks later, this time getting the better of right-back Bill Foulkes. United went on to secure their First Division status with a 2–1 victory at Blackpool on 30 April, with Grainger scoring one of the goals. Another goal on the final day of the 1954–55 season took his tally to six goals in 25 appearances and helped to secure a 5–2 win over Portsmouth to leave United 13th in the table.\n\nFreeman died of cancer in August 1955 and the team struggled at the start of the 1955–56 campaign. However Grainger scored both goals in a 2–0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 September, providing Joe Mercer his first win as a manager. He impressed Birmingham City manager Arthur Turner sufficiently in a 2–0 Christmas Eve victory that Mercer was forced to rejected a transfer offer, as he told the press that \"The answer [to enquiries for Grainger] will always be the same: no!\" However United struggled in the second half of the season and were relegated with a 3–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 28 April, Grainger scoring United's goal before centre-back Howard Johnson was forced off with injury to leave United with only ten men.\n\nUnited opened the 1956–57 Second Division campaign away at Rotherham United, the first match where the two Grainger brothers would play on opposite teams, and it was the away side who claimed a 4–0 victory, with Grainger scoring two goals. As an England international playing in the second tier he found the league relatively easy, and on 1 September he secured his first career hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Barnsley after taking the bus to Oakwell as it was near the family home in Havercroft. However an injury picked up on England duty caused him to miss six weeks going into the new year and upon his recovery Mercer informed him that the club's directors had ordered him to sell Grainger for the best possible price as quickly as possible. Wolverhampton Wanderers made an offer of £23,000, but could not pay the full amount immediately, and so Sheffield United instead accepted an offer of £17,000 plus Sam Kemp (valued at £6,000) from Sunderland. Grainger was firmly against the move, but the Sheffield United board of directors were determined to bring in a large fee to pay off creditors and Mercer illegally handed him £300 as recompense.\n\nSunderland\nGrainger's arrival at Sunderland's Roker Park in February 1957 came at a difficult time as Bill Murray's 18-year reign as manager was coming to an end. The club was freely spending money, paying out £22,000 for Don Revie in addition to the £23,000 fee for Grainger, but were struggling near the bottom of the First Division. Sunderland spent the second half of the 1956–57 season in the bottom four and lost their final three matches, but avoided relegation as they ended the season one position and three points ahead of relegated Cardiff City. Sunderland were also charged by The Football Association with making illegal payments to players and chairman Bill Ditchburn was handed a lifetime ban from football whilst the club were fined £5,000 and Murray resigned his post.\n\nMurray's successor as manager, Alan Brown, alienated senior players such as Billy Bingham, Don Revie and Len Shackleton, leaving Grainger to later comment that \"Brown's presence had created discordance out of harmony, anxiety out of tranquillity\" and \"football felt like work and training felt like prison\". Having been dropped to the reserves a month in the 1957–58 season, Grainger and goalkeeper Ray Daniel requested transfers. However he stayed on Wearside and despite beating Portsmouth on the last day of the season, Sunderland occupied the final relegation place after finishing level on points with Portsmouth but with an inferior goal average; it was the first relegation in Sunderland's history since they became founder members of the Football League in 1890 and was the last time Grainger would play in the top-flight.\n\nGrainger scored the club's first goal in the Second Division on 23 August 1958, in a 3–1 defeat at Lincoln City. He broke his collarbone in a 1–0 win over Huddersfield Town, causing him to miss five matches at a crucial time when his form was good and he was being considered again for the England squad. He totalled three goals from 37 games in the 1958–59 campaign, finding that he gelled well with new signing Ernie Taylor.\n\nHe played 41 of the club's 42 league matches in the 1959–60 season, missing only a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion on 2 January, but Sunderland laboured to a 16th-place finish. Grainger become further disillusioned and handed in a transfer request after the board of directors rejected his request of a loan in order to invest in a newsagent's shop in South Shields. He refused to play any matches for Sunderland in the 1960–61 season, leaving him labelled as a \"rebel footballer\" in the press, whilst Stan Anderson, Ernie Taylor, Alan O'Neill and Reg Pearce also demanded interviews with the board of directors to voice their dissatisfaction in the running of the club.\n\nLeeds United\nGrainger was sold to Leeds United for a club record fee of £15,000 in July 1960, a team that had just been relegated into the Second Division, and he was given an illegal signing-on fee. Manager Jack Taylor freed him of any defensive responsibilities, with left-back Grenville Hair fit and competent enough to not need any assistance from his outside-left. However Grainger was not able to take full advantage of this tactic as his right ankle had deteriorated to the point that it needed heavy strapping and he suffered a lack of speed and confidence as a result. He did though show promising form early into his brief time at Elland Road, scoring his first goal for the club in his fourth game, a 4–4 draw at Bristol Rovers,  following up with his second goal five days later in a 4–2 win at Southampton. With the maximum wage abolished in January 1961, he signed a new contract of £20-a-week. Don Revie succeeded Jack Taylor as manager in March and Grainger was in the starting eleven for Revie's first game as manager, a 3–1 loss at Charlton Athletic. However he was dropped after suffering a knee injury and then worsened the injury in a reserve team game against Derby County. A surgeon discovered tissue damage underneath the kneecap and removed the cartilage, leaving Grainger to recover over the summer. He was still out of action at the start of the 1961–62 campaign, and with the club desperate for funds and Albert Johanneson performing well in his absence, Revie made Grainger available for transfer.\n\nPort Vale\nGrainger signed with Third Division side Port Vale when manager Norman Low paid £6,000 for his services in October 1961. Second Division Preston North End were also willing to pay the £6,000 fee, but refused to pay a signing-on fee, whilst Port Vale offered Grainger wages of £30-a-week with bonuses and a £300 signing-on fee as they wanted to match Potteries derby rivals Stoke City's ambition in re-signing Stanley Matthews. His debut was described as a 'triumphant' one as he scored in a 4–1 win over Torquay United at Vale Park on 21 October. On 27 January, he helped his new team to a 0–0 draw at former club Sunderland in the FA Cup fourth round and before the match gave his teammates placebo pills in order to boost their confidence. Four days later they completing the giant-killing with a 3–1 win at home and Grainger later commented that it was his best performance either playing for or against Sunderland. The club failed to replicate this form in the league however and Grainger picked up a groin injury during one of coach Eric Jones's notoriously strenuous fitness sessions. He took a cortisone injection to get him through the fifth round defeat at Fulham on 17 February and then ruled himself out of action for the rest of the 1961–62 season; Vale went on to end the campaign in a disappointing 12th-position.\n\nLow preferred Stan Edwards at outside-left at the start of the 1962–63 campaign, but Grainger was returned to the starting line-up for the third match of the season, and scored in a 2–0 win over Reading. A harshly cold winter known as the \"Big Freeze\" savaged the footballing season and Vale went from 22 December to 2 March without fulfilling a league fixture; however this aided Grainger as he was able to rest and heal his groin problem rather than rely on cortisone injections to mask the pain. He was however in conflict with new manager Freddie Steele, who told him the pain in his groin was just psychological. The Big Freeze's resulting fixture congestion was too much for Grainger to cope with and he again injured his groin in a 2–1 defeat to Barnsley on 29 March and could only feature in three of the club's final fifteen games as Vale went on to finish in third-place, four points shy of a promotion spot.\n\nHe started the opening game of the 1963–64 season, a 1–0 defeat at Shrewsbury Town, but then missed the next seven months due to his groin injury, and Ron Smith was signed as a long-term replacement on the left-wing. Grainger played two games in March and then again returned to reserve team football. He was not offered a new contract in the summer.\n\nDoncaster Rovers\nGrainger signed with Doncaster Rovers on 7 August 1964, having been signed by outgoing manager Oscar Hold on £30-a-week wages and a £1,000 signing-on fee. Whilst training with Barnsley over the summer, chairman Joe Richards had offered to match Doncaster's contract offer, but Grainger declined as he already had a verbal agreement with Doncaster. New player-manager Bill Leivers gave debuts to Grainger and five other new signings on the opening day of the 1964–65 season, a 5–2 defeat away at Bradford (Park Avenue). However their form soon improved and Grainger was able to manage his groin injury well enough to make 41 appearances throughout the campaign. This was despite his reputation as a former England international bringing him rough treatment from opposition defenders, so much so that he reacted to Brighton & Hove Albion winger Wally Gould's late tackles by punching Gould in the face, earning himself a red card and 21 day suspension. He then lost his first-team place at Belle Vue and featured just six times during the 1965–66 season, but turned down an offer from Football League chairman Alan Hardaker to represent Irish club Drumcondra in the European Cup. Grainger played an official game in the Football League for the final time on 15 October, away at Tranmere Rovers, but did start in another game seven days later that was abandoned because of fog. He was made available for transfer in December. Doncaster won the Fourth Division title, though Grainger was not eligible for a medal as he had only played five league games of the 1965–66 season and he was not retained in the summer.\n\nLater career\nGrainger was offered a contract by Yorkshire League club Bridlington Town, Wellington Town of the Cheshire County League, and Southern League side Poole Town. However he instead chose to sign with Cheshire County League side Macclesfield Town after agreeing a contract of £17-a-week and £300 signing-on fee from manager Albert Leake. However he played just four matches at Moss Rose before asking to be released in October in order to focus on his singing career. After retiring from football in 1966, he became a sales representative and later an area manager in Yorkshire. He did however go on to serve non-league Newmillerdam as player-manager from 1969 to 1972 and went on play for Woolley Miners Welfare in the Yorkshire League from 1972 to 1978, helping the club to win promotion from Division 2 in the 1972–73 campaign and featuring in both the FA Trophy and FA Vase competitions.\n\nIn 1978, Grainger accepted an offer from Billy Bingham to scout for Mansfield Town in the North East and recommended Chris Waddle to the club, though they did not act on his recommendation. He later scouted for Allan Clarke at Barnsley and Leeds United, for Mick Buxton at Huddersfield Town and for Neil Warnock at Oldham Athletic, Bury and Sheffield United.\n\nInternational career\nOn 25 April 1956, Grainger was selected for a Football League representative match against the Irish League in Belfast, which ended in a 5–2 defeat. He earned his first England cap on 9 May 1956 in a friendly with Brazil at Wembley Stadium. He scored within the opening minutes with his first touch of the ball and in the 83rd-minute headed in England's fourth. Of his debut against Brazil, Grainger said: \"When you think of the talent in that England team, with Duncan Edwards, Billy Wright and Stanley Matthews, you delight in what might have been. We will never know how good the team could have been because Munich cheated us. But in 1956, we scored four against Brazil at Wembley and we even missed two penalties. That was how superior we were that day. Two years later, Brazil won the World Cup.\" He picked up two further caps in a tour of Scandinavia, in a 0–0 draw with Sweden and 5–2 victory in Finland. It was during this tour that his reputation as a singer became established after Nat Lofthouse asked him to sing at a bar attended by football journalists. The tour ended in a trip to Berlin to face West Germany on 26 May, the World Cup champions of 1954, a game England won 3–1 and that won Grainger praise from the British and German press, with England manager Walter Winterbottom effusing that \"I was extremely pleased with Colin Grainger\".\n\nGrainger was selected for the British Home Championship match in Belfast against Northern Ireland on 6 October 1956 and forced goalkeeper Harry Gregg into some excellent saves to keep the game as a 1–1 draw. He was again selected for The Football League XI v Irish League match on 31 October despite suffering from a toe injury, scoring in what ended as a 3–2 victory at St James' Park. He won a sixth England cap in a 3–1 victory over Wales on 14 November, but was forced to leave the game early with a twisted ankle after stretching to receive a pass from Johnny Haynes. His seventh and final cap for England came against Scotland at Wembley on 6 April 1957, the final game of the 1956–57 British Home Championship, which ended in a 2–1 victory to secure the title for England. He provided the cross for Derek Kevan to score England's first goal of the game but otherwise felt he performed poorly and was never selected again. He never fully recovered to the standard he was at before his ankle injury, and the outside-left spot at the 1958 FIFA World Cup was taken by Alan A'Court.\n\nMusical career\nGrainger signed a contract with talent agent Len Young in 1956. His first gig was as a support act to American group the Hilltoppers in Sheffield, for which he was paid £50, singing three songs from the back catalogues of Al Jolson, Nat King Cole and Billy Eckstine. Due to his footballing career he was forced to turn down the offer to join the Hilltoppers on a financially lucrative tour of the US. His performance earned him a television appearance on ITV and a regular column in the Sport Express that was written by Brian Glanville. In summer 1957 he toured England and received vocal training from talent agent Joe Collins, father of actress Joan Collins. He then performed with Jack Hylton and his orchestra on ITV's After Hours show, presented by Hughie Green, and also did a television show for the BBC with Winifred Atwell, Eric Robinson and Matt Monro. He went on to be signed to the HMV label, releasing \"This I Know\"/\"Are You\" as a single in 1958.\n\nIn February 1958, he signed a contract with MCA on £250-a-week for the summer. He was offered the opportunity of touring Australia with comedian Nat Jackley in summer 1960, but turned it down as it would interfere with his pre-season training for football. On 13 June 1963, he shared a bill with the Beatles in Stockport, who received the same £50 fee as Grainger after having agreed to the gig some months earlier before their recent chart success with \"Please Please Me\" and \"From Me to You\". He gave his final performance in Leeds in August 1970 when he retired from performing in order to focus on his career in sales.\n\nDuring his time as a footballer he was known as 'the singing winger' due to his vocal talent and the fact that he performed at pubs and clubs. Of his singing career, Grainger said: \"I was far more nervous before a gig than before a match. In football, you're one man of 11, but in singing, you're one man of one.\" Entertainment magazine The Stage described him as \"a very pleasing vocalist, notable for a small style and ability to sustain long notes\".\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\nSource:\n\nInternational\n\nHonours\nEngland\n British Home Championship: 1956–57\n\nWoolley Miners Welfare\n Yorkshire League Division 2 promotion: 1972–73\n\nReferences\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n \n\n1933 births\nLiving people\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nWrexham A.F.C. players\nSheffield United F.C. players\nSunderland A.F.C. players\nLeeds United F.C. players\nPort Vale F.C. players\nDoncaster Rovers F.C. players\nMacclesfield Town F.C. players\nWoolley Miners Welfare F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nEnglish Football League representative players\nEngland international footballers\nEnglish football managers\nAssociation football player-managers\nEnglish male singers\nAssociation football scouts\nMansfield Town F.C. non-playing staff\nBarnsley F.C. non-playing staff\nLeeds United F.C. non-playing staff\nHuddersfield Town A.F.C. non-playing staff\nOldham Athletic A.F.C. non-playing staff\nBury F.C. non-playing staff\nSheffield United F.C. non-playing staff\nEnglish columnists\nEnglish autobiographers", "machine_text": "Colin Grainger was a British singer, songwriter, and actor who was born on 16 August 1936 in Liverpool, England. He was known for his rich baritone voice and his versatile singing style which incorporated elements of jazz, pop, soul, and rock and roll. Grainger rose to fame in the 1950s and 1960s as a member of the popular vocal group The Fourmost, which was one of the many bands managed by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. Grainger and The Fourmost enjoyed a string of hits throughout the 1960s, including \"A Little Loving,\" \"Hello Little Girl,\" \"Baby Sittin' Boogie,\" and \"I'm in Love.\" The band was particularly successful in Germany, where they became one of the most popular acts of the era. In addition to his work as a musician, Grainger was also an accomplished actor, and he appeared in several television shows and films throughout his career. Despite his success, Grainger's career was interrupted in the late 1960s due to personal problems and he left The Fourmost after the band's final single in 1968. He continued to perform and record throughout the 1970s and beyond but was never able to recapture the commercial success of his early career. In later years, Grainger became a prominent advocate for mental health awareness and worked closely with mental health charities in the UK. He was also a frequent guest on radio and television programmes, where he discussed his experiences and promoted mental health initiatives. Colin Grainger passed away on 14 February 2021 at the age of 84, leaving behind a legacy as one of Britain's most beloved and enduring talents of the 20th century.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13624656}

In his preface Braithwaite describes himself as being in the service of the African Company, and as having, when very young, served in the fleet in Anne's reign, and then having been a lieutenant in the Welsh fusiliers, ensign in the Royal Guards, and secretary to his kinsman Christian Cole, the British resident at Venice, with whom he traveled through Europe. Braithwaite married Christian's niece Silvia, whose father was a merchant in Amsterdam.\n\nHe also states that he was in the Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent expeditions, and was present at the siege of Gibraltar (1727). Thence he crossed to Morocco and joined the British consul-general, John Russel, in his expedition in the emperor's dominions, the experiences of which he relates in his book. The diary of the narrative extends from July 1727 to February 1728.\n\nDeath and family \n\nCol John Braithwaite was killed when the vessel \"Baltick Merchant\" was attacked and captured by a Franco-Spanish privateer (the \"Biscaya\") off the Scilly Isles.  Braithwaite was murdered after the surrender.  He was survived by his wife, Silvia (nee Cole),  his elder daughter Caroline,  who married Robert Armitage,  his  only son  Major-General Sir John Braithwaite, 1st Baronet and  a younger daughter, Sylvia.  The last is assumed to have been born after the death of Colonel Braithwaite. She married  the poet  Bonnell Thornton. Her mother remarried Reverend Thomas Winstanley and had a further son, Thomas, who died at 21. The elder Silvia died in 1799.\n\nA Captain Braithwaite is mentioned in the London Gazette as being appointed in 1749 to command the Peggy sloop, and again in 1761 as commanding the Shannon.  However, this was Richard Braithwaite, a younger cousin.\n\nIn February 1768, a John Braithwaite was removed from the post of secretary to the governor of Gibraltar; but it is certain this is not Col John Braithwaite.\n\nReferences \n\n1696 births\n1740 deaths\n18th-century English writers\n18th-century English male writers", "machine_text": "John Braithwaite is a leading author in the field of criminology, specializing in regulatory and restorative justice. Born in 1951 in Australia, Braithwaite earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Australian National University and his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. Braithwaite has held academic positions at several prestigious universities, including the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, the Australian Graduate School of Policing, and the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom. He has also been a visiting professor at numerous universities around the world, including the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Cambridge. Braithwaite's research has focused on the effectiveness of different approaches to criminal justice, particularly those based on regulation and restoration. He has argued for a more collaborative and communicative approach to justice, in which offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and make amends to their victims and communities. Braithwaite's work has also addressed issues related to white-collar crime, corporate regulation, and environmental law. As well as his academic work, Braithwaite has been involved in public policy and advocacy. He served as Chairman of the Australian Government's National Roundtable on Restorative Justice and has advised governments and organizations around the world on criminal justice and regulatory issues. In 2006, he was awarded the prestigious Stockholm Prize in Criminology for his contributions to the field. Braithwaite is the author of numerous books, including Crime, Shame, and Reintegration (1989), Restorative Justice and Responsive Regulation (2002), and Anomie and Violence: Non-truth and Reconciliation in Indonesian Peacebuilding (2014).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monteregian Hills\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Monteregian Hills () is a linear chain of isolated hills in Montreal and Montérégie, between the Laurentians and the Appalachians.\n\nEtymology\nThe first definition of the Monteregian Hills came about in 1903 when Montreal geologist Frank Dawson Adams began referring to Mount Royal (Latin, Mons Regius) and hills of similar geology in the Saint Lawrence Lowlands as the \"Royal Mountains\" (). Other hills in the chain included Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire, Mont Rougemont, Mont Yamaska, Mont Shefford, and Mont Brome.\n\nIt was only later that Mont Mégantic, the Oka Hills, as well as the Saint-André and d'Iberville formations, were added to the list.\n\nGeology\nEach hill in the chain consists of an erosional remnant of Cretaceous intrusive igneous rock and associated hornfels, which are more resistant to weathering than the surrounding sedimentary rock. All of the hills have dark-coloured mafic rock such as gabbro and essexite; some also have large areas of pulaskite, syenite, and other light-coloured rock.\n\nThe Monteregian Hills are part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the long-lived New England hotspot, and are the eroded remnants of intrusive stocks. These intrusive stocks have been variously interpreted as the feeder intrusions of long extinct volcanoes, which would have been active about 125 million years ago, or as intrusives that never breached the surface in volcanic activity. The lack of an obvious track west of the Monteregian Hills may be due either to failure of the plume to penetrate the Canadian Shield, to the lack of recognizable intrusions, or to strengthening of the plume when it approached the Monteregian Hills region. However, there is evidence the hotspot track extends northwestwards, including epeirogenic uplift, mantle velocity anomalies and kimberlitic volcanic features (e.g. the Attawapiskat, Kirkland Lake and Lake Timiskaming kimberlite fields) that become older away from the Monteregian Hills.\n\nThe shallow, rocky sandy loam soils of the summits are mostly covered in forest. Where the underlying rock is rich in olivine, as over large areas of Mont Saint-Bruno and Mont Rougemont, these soils are classed as dystric brunisol. Podzol tends to develop over rock which lacks olivine, although many of these podzols lack an eluvial (Ae) horizon. Lower slopes are covered with aprons of gravel or sand. The sandy soils are usually podzols with classic Ae development; they often have subsoil hardpan and are undesirable for agriculture. The free-draining gravels are preferred for apple orchards, which grow in thermal belts where cold air can drain to the valley floor.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nVolcanism of Canada\nVolcanism of Eastern Canada\n\nExternal links\n\n  Les collines montérégiennes Geologic information about the chain\n\nReferences\n\nMountain ranges of Quebec\nMountains of Quebec\nCretaceous volcanism\nIgneous petrology of Quebec\nLandforms of Montérégie", "machine_text": "Monteregian Hills are a group of isolated small mountains located in the western part of the province of Quebec, Canada. The hills are composed of igneous rocks that date back to the Cretaceous period, approximately 120 million years ago. The five hills that makeup Monteregian Hills include Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire, Mont Rougemont, and Mont Yamaska. These hills are exceptional for their geological composition and their significant impact on the landscape of the region. Mont Saint-Bruno is located in the town of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, approximately 25 km from Montreal. It is a popular park for hiking and is also home to a variety of flora and fauna. Mont Saint-Hilaire is located in the city of Saint-Hilaire, and its summit is known as la Tour du Pain. In 1958, Mont Saint-Hilaire and its surroundings were declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. Mont Saint-Grégoire is located in the town of Mont-Saint-Grégoire and is a popular destination for viewing fall foliage. Mont Rougemont is located in the town of Rougemont and has a unique elliptical shape, while Mont Yamaska is located in the town of Saint-Paul-d'Abbotsford. The hills have played a significant role in the history of the region. They were used as landmarks by Indigenous peoples, and later, as landmarks by early European explorers. The hills are also significant for their contribution to the agricultural landscape of the area. The volcanic soil of the Monteregian Hills is fertile, and the hills have been used for farming since the 17th century. The hills continue to be an important part of the landscape of the region and attract visitors from around the world for their unique geological features and natural beauty.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1746067}

It is a single-headed barrel-shaped drum with its membranes made from animal skin. The Karimpana is similar to the mridangam and pakhawaj in shape, but it is smaller in size. It is an intrinsic part of traditional Kerala art forms like Kathakali, Theyyam, and Panchavadyam. The name \"Karimpana\" comes from the Malayalam words \"Karimbu\" meaning bamboo or cane, and \"panai\" meaning pot, as the earliest versions of the instrument were made from bamboo. Later, the instrument evolved to be made from wood, and today's Karimpanas are usually made from the jackfruit tree wood. The Karimpana is played by striking the drumhead with a pair of wooden sticks, called \"chenda vattam\" and \"olakkai.\" The player can control the sound of the Karimpana by varying the force and angle of the strike, and by modulating the pressure on the skin of the drum. The Karimpana is known for its deep, resonant sound which adds depth and richness to the musical performance. The Karimpana is often played in ensembles, along with other traditional instruments like the chenda, ilathalam, kombu, and kurumkuzhal. The ensemble is called \"Panchavadyam,\" which literally means five instruments. Panchavadyam ensembles are usually performed during temple festivals, processions, and other ceremonial events in Kerala. In recent times, the popularity of the Karimpana and Panchavadyam has spread beyond Kerala. There are many music schools and organizations that teach and promote these traditional art forms around the world. The Karimpana has become an important element in Indian classical and fusion music, and it is still revered as a symbol of Kerala's rich cultural heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44086729}

Established in 1988 as WSTL, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst usage of frequency in Glens Falls\n\n1410 AM went on the air as WSET in 1959, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. WSET and WBZA broadcast at 1410 AM with a \"daytime only\" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6am. In 1971, the format was flipped to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230, in late 1982; that station is now WMML, a sister station to WENU.\n\nCurrent station\nFrom 1982 to 1988, the 1410 frequency previously occupied by WBZA was off the air, until returning as country music station WSTL in 1988. The station took on the WBZA call letters in early January 1998, and changed again in September 2000 to the current WENU.\n\nFor a time being, WENU was a simulcast of the FM station, now WNYQ, with an Adult Standards format.  When the FM changed to AC, WENU remained with Adult Standards.  More recently, WENU has flipped to a Classic Country format.\n\nOn January 30, 2012, WENU, along with sister station WMML, signed off the air, as the antenna in Queensbury, New York was torn down to allow a new antenna to be put up in place.  WENU returned to the air with a new nickname, \"The U\" on March 15, 2012 and a greater focus on community news coverage. WENU's new signal allows people in northern Warren County and southern Saratoga County to hear the station.\n\nWENU's Classic Country format came to an end on February 22, 2013 while CBS Sports Radio came on February 23, 2013.\n\nOn January 3, 2019, WENU dropped its CBS Sports Radio format and began simulcasting WROW, its sister station in Albany which carries a soft oldies format.\n\nPrevious logo\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nENU\nRadio stations established in 1988\nOldies radio stations in the United States\nPamal Broadcasting\n1988 establishments in New York (state)", "machine_text": "WENU (short for \"We empower new users\") is an open-source project aimed at helping new computer users become more proficient in using their devices.

The population was 8,126 at the 2010 census.  The township consists of five non-contiguous sections bordered mostly by the cities of East Lansing and Lansing.  The township also contains the community of Edgemont Park.\n\nHistory\nThe first white pioneer to purchase land in the township was Jacob F. Cooley in 1837. The township was organized in 1842 in the northwest corner of Ingham County and was named after the hometown of one of the township's original settlers. The township experienced its first loss of land in 1859 when the unincorporated settlement of Lansing officially incorporated as a city out of seven square miles near the center of the township.\n\nDescription\nThe cities of Lansing and East Lansing have incorporated much of the land that formerly constituted the township reducing the township from its original  to its current  in five disconnected land areas.\n\nThe western section of the township is the largest, and it includes almost all of the township's industrial developments including the large General Motors Lansing Craft Center and General Motors Lansing Metal Center automobile factories, both of which were closed and shuttered in early 2006. A Superfund site, Adams Plating, is located in this part of the township. Also in the western part are the former Waverly Golf Course and the adjacent Michigan Avenue Park. Formerly owned and operated by the city of Lansing, Michigan Avenue Park included a sledding hill and Little League Baseball field.  At the north end of this section of the township north of Saginaw Highway (M-43) lies the residential neighborhood and CDP (census-designated place) of Edgemont Park.\n\nThe northeastern section of the township is heavily industrialized on its western end (west of Wood Road), but since 2002 this section has become the 'downtown' of Lansing Township with the construction of the Eastwood Towne Center, one of the largest shopping malls in Metropolitan Lansing, and the subsequent creation of the Lansing Township Downtown Development Authority to capture state and national funds for development.\n\nThe central eastern sections of the township are almost exclusively residential, save for a small strip of land that runs along either side of US-127. The northern portion of these two sections contain the large Groesbeck neighborhood, and the smaller southern portion includes part of the Urbandale neighborhood.\n\nThe southeastern section of the township is exclusively agricultural in nature, containing experimental farms for Michigan State University.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which  is land and  (2.52%) is water.\n\nDemographics\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,126 people, 3,929 households, and 1,897 families residing in the township. The population density was 1,658.3 per square mile (634.8/km2). There were 4,319 housing units at an average density of 881.4 per square mile (337.4/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 76.3% White, 12.5% African American, 0.5% Native American, 2.6% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 3.5% from other races, and 4.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.9% of the population.\n\n2000 census\nThere were 4,104 households, out of which 22.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.3% were married couples living together, 12.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.1% were non-families. 40.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.05 and the average family size was 2.78.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out, with 20.9% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 32.9% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 87.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $41,017, and the median income for a family was $50,632. Males had a median income of $37,124 versus $28,829 for females. The per capita income for the township was $22,885.

In particular, it provides an argument for the uncertainty principle on the basis of the principles of classical optics. \n\nThe concept was criticized by Heisenberg's mentor Niels Bohr, and theoretical and experimental developments have suggested that Heisenberg's intuitive explanation of his mathematical result might be misleading. While the act of measurement does lead to uncertainty, the loss of precision is less than that predicted by Heisenberg's argument when measured at the level of an individual state. The formal mathematical result remains valid, however, and the original intuitive argument has also been vindicated mathematically when the notion of disturbance is expanded to be independent of any specific state.\n\nHeisenberg's argument\n\nHeisenberg supposes that an electron is like a classical particle, moving in the  direction along a line below the microscope. Let the cone of light rays leaving the microscope lens and focusing on the electron make an angle   with the electron. Let  be the wavelength of the light rays. Then, according to the laws of classical optics, the microscope can only resolve the position of the electron up to an accuracy of\n\nAn observer perceives an image of the particle because the light rays strike the particle and bounce back through the microscope to the observer's eye. We know from experimental evidence that when a photon strikes an electron, the latter has a Compton recoil with momentum proportional to , where  is Planck's constant. However, the extent of \"recoil cannot be exactly known, since the direction of the scattered photon is undetermined within the bundle of rays entering the microscope.\" In particular, the electron's momentum in the  direction is only determined up to\n\nCombining the relations for  and , we thus have\n\n,\n\nwhich is an approximate expression of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nAnalysis of argument\n\nAlthough the thought experiment was formulated as an introduction to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, one of the pillars of modern physics, it attacks the very premises under which it was constructed, thereby contributing to the development of an area of physics—namely, quantum mechanics—that redefined the terms under which the original thought experiment was conceived. \n\nQuantum mechanics questions whether an electron actually has a determinate position before it is disturbed by the measurement used to establish said determinate position. Under a more thorough quantum mechanical analysis, an electron has some probability of showing up at any point in the universe, though the probability that it will be far from where one  expects becomes very low at great distances from the neighborhood in which it is originally found. In other words, the \"position\" of an electron can only be stated in terms of a probability distribution, as can predictions of where it may move.\n\nSee also\n Atom localization\n Quantum mechanics\n Basics of quantum mechanics\n Interpretation of quantum mechanics\n Philosophical interpretation of classical physics\n Schrödinger's cat\n Uncertainty principle\n Quantum field theory\n Electromagnetic radiation\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\nHistory of Heisenberg's Microscope\nLectures on Heisenberg's Microscope\n\nThought experiments in quantum mechanics\nWerner Heisenberg", "machine_text": "Heisenberg's microscope is a thought experiment proposed by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927 to illustrate the limitations of measuring in quantum mechanics. This concept is based on the uncertainty principle, which says that the position and momentum of an object cannot be known simultaneously with unlimited precision. According to the thought experiment, if we want to measure the position of a subatomic particle accurately, we need to shine light on it. However, the act of shining light changes the momentum of the particle, and as a result, the position becomes less precise. Vice versa, if we want to measure the momentum of the particle accurately, we need to use a microscope with a smaller wavelength, which increases the momentum of the photon and correspondingly decreases the precision in position. The Heisenberg's microscope experiment is based on the assumption that a microscope is capable of examining an object with unlimited precision. However, conventional microscopes function on classical optics principles, which indeed cannot overcome the limitations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The experiment has significant implications for various quantum-mechanical phenomena, including the wave-particle duality and the complementarity principle. It points to the fundamental uncertainty of the foundational principles of physics and shows us that there is a limit to our ability to understand the physical world. Some proposed variations on the thought experiment include using neutron sources instead of light, suggesting the possibility of more precise measurements, but still limited by the uncertainty principle. In summary, Heisenberg's microscope thought experiment has greatly contributed to our understanding of the limits of measurement and the uncertainty principle. It highlights the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and reminds us that there is much to be uncovered yet about the nature of matter and energy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3067278}

Multiprotocol encapsulation allows two different protocols to communicate with each other by encapsulating the data, allowing it to be transmitted over a network that would not otherwise be able to understand the protocol. Multiprotocol encapsulation operates on the transport layer of the OSI model and involves encapsulating one protocol inside another. This enables data to be transmitted through routers and other network devices that may not support the original protocol. The two most commonly used protocols for encapsulation are IP (Internet Protocol) and GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation). IP is used as the outer protocol, while GRE is used as the inner protocol. Other protocols that can be encapsulated include Ethernet, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). Multiprotocol encapsulation offers numerous benefits to network administrators. One of the most significant benefits is that it allows different networks to communicate with each other, even if they use different protocols. This eliminates the need for multiple networks and reduces complexity, making it easier for administrators to manage and maintain their networks. Multiprotocol encapsulation also improves network performance, as it allows data to be transmitted more efficiently by reducing the number of protocol translations and network hops. Multiprotocol encapsulation is widely used in today’s networks, particularly in large enterprise networks and service provider networks.

It was once home to the Fagan family. In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the land to the New South Wales State Government. Hornsby Shire Council was appointed sole trustee. The park was officially opened by the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, MP on 5 November 1988.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Fagan Family\n\nWilliam Fagan was a free settler who emigrated from Derry in Ireland who arrived in Sydney in 1848. He later married Ann Waddell and the couple had three sons and four daughters. After their marriage the Fagans purchased  of land in Arcadia, New South Wales and the family established a successful citrus orchard. They were pioneers in the citrus industry in Dural, Galston and Arcadia, on the north-western outskirts of Sydney. Two of William and Ann's sons, William and Samuel, worked in the family business and later began their own operation at Dural. In 1900, Samuel and his wife acquired land at Galston and conducted their business on the property. They constructed 'Netherby,' a house made of bricks that were hand made. The property was the largest orchard in Galston and had a sizable workforce.\n\nBy the early 1930s, because of the arrival of the Great Depression, Samuel Fagan commenced to closed down his orchards. Bruce Fagan, the youngest child in the family, ran a herd of Jersey dairy cattle on the property after the closure of the orchard. He later added a dairy building to the property and commenced a renowned cattle breeding programme. In 1980 Bruce Fagan and his sister, Ida, donated the original property, \"Fagan Park,\" to the Department of Lands. The Hornsby Shire Council was appointed as the sole trustee for the park. Before his death in 1984, Bruce Fagan was consulted regarding development plans for the site.\n\nBicentennial Project\n\nThe Bicentenary of Australia was celebrated in 1988. It marked the occasion of the beginning of European settlement of Australia, with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. A national programme of events and celebrations was organised to celebrate the occasion and Fagan Park was adopted as Hornsby Shire Council's bicentennial project. The Council received a government grant towards the cost of the planned \"Garden of Many Nations.\" The garden now covers  of the park and features the flora of countries from all over the world including North America and South America, Great Britain, Africa, Asia and the Netherlands The original homestead, 'Netherby', together with the original milking complex and packing shed, were also restored for the bicentennial year. \"Netherby\" is regularly opened for inspection and the packing shed and milking complex are used as a rural museum.\n\nSport and Recreation \n\n The Galston Parkrun event is held every Saturday at 8 am. This is a timed run over 5 kilometres. It is organised by volunteers and is free of charge.\n The Hornsby Electric Model Flying Club meets in the park.\n The Friends of Fagan Park meet regularly.\n The Fagan Park Eco Garden is a Council-driven community initiative that showcases environmentally friendly gardening techniques.

The park follows the traditional trust, owned and operated by the Hornsby Shire Council since its establishment in 1993. Fagan Park spans over 55 hectares and serves as a major entertainment and recreational hub for the region. The park was named after Dorothy Fagan, a farmer's wife who donated a significant portion of her land to the council to create the park. The park was then developed with the inclusion of gardens, walking tracks, a playground, picnic areas, and BBQ facilities. The park's natural bushland, gardens, and ponds provide a peaceful and relaxing environment for visitors. Fagan Park is particularly renowned for its diversity in flora and fauna.

He moved up to the reserves thereafter, but never made a first-team appearance. He made his professional debut for Brescia in a Coppa Italia match against Cremonese.\n\nEarly life\nMitrović was born in Högaholm in Almvik, a neighbourhood of Malmö, Sweden. He is of Serbian descent. He has a younger brother, Alexandar, and an older sister, Christina.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\nAt the age of four, Mitrović began playing football for a local team BK Olympic but shortly moved on to Malmö FF at the age of six.\n\nMalmö FF\nMitrović joined Malmö FF at the age of six where he spent most of his youth before moving to Chelsea FC in 2008 at the age of sixteen. He scored more goals than appearances made for the club. He did not play much for Malmö after the move.\n\nChelsea FC\nMarko agreed to join Chelsea in January 2008, to join as a first-year scholar in June of the same year, staying with his home-town club until the transfer, with semi-regular visits to Cobham. Early signs were that Marko would score goals, and plenty of them. His arrival at Chelsea proper was delayed by participation in the Under-16 Nordic Tournament. In four games, he scored seven goals to easily finish as top goalscorer. He then won the Golden Boot in the Cobham Cup, before his first season was beset by injuries – first a thigh problem, then a back issue, and damaged ankle ligaments ended his season early. He still managed five goals in eight starts, an indication of his ability. Coming back refreshed from a summer break ahead of 2009/10, year two was Marko's breakthrough campaign. He finished top of the club's junior goalscoring ranks, a tally which compared well with the country's leading youth goalscorers, and he was a crucial part of the team's success in the FA Youth Cup, scoring the equaliser in the second leg of the Final against Aston Villa. He missed the first seven months of the 2010-11 season, having undergone surgery to repair damaged ankle ligaments early in the campaign. His return came in early March 2011, in a reserve match away to Bolton Wanderers. Injuries have, however, continued to affect him throughout the year of 2011 and into 2012, and he departed at the end of his contract in June 2012.\n\nBrescia Calcio\nIn the summer of 2012, Mitrović joined the Italian Serie B club Brescia Calcio.\n\n2012-13 season\nHe made his professional debut for Brescia in a Coppa Italia match against Cremonese. On 25 August 2012, he made his Serie B debut coming of the bench, in a 1-0 loss against Crotone. He finished the season scoring two goals in 22 games coming off the bench.\n\n2013-14 season\nIn the first game of the 2013-14 season, Mitrović scored his first goal of the season in a Coppa Italia win against S.S. Teramo Calcio.\n\nInternational career\nMarko has represented Sweden at Under-16, Under-17, and Under-19 levels. He took part in Nordic Cup with Sweden where they finished as runners-up, being beaten by Norway. He is, however, also eligible to play for Serbia.\n\nStyle of play\nHe is tall, broad and strong, with good left foot shot and impressive skill levels. Mitrović plays an attacking role, most often playing as a striker but can also play as a winger, and is known for his finishing, pace, dribbling, positioning, strength and his aerial ability. Although left footed, he is also able to control and dribble the ball and finish well with his right foot. Mitrović is known for his pace, skill, control and dribbling ability, as well as his flair in beating players during one on one situations. Uniquely, his height, strength, jumping ability and heading technique have given him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls, with the majority of his goals often being headers. He has often been compared to a young Zlatan Ibrahimović.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nChelsea FC\n Cobham Cup (1): 2008-09\n FA Youth Cup (1): 2009-10\n Premier Reserve League (1): 2010-11\n\nIndividual\n Cobham Cup Golden Boot (1): 2008-09\n\nReferences\n\n Profile at Brescia Calcio\n Profile at Chelsea F.C.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships to low-income children in Washington D.C. for tuition and other fees at participating private schools. The program was the first Federally funded school voucher program in the United States. It was first approved in 2003 and allowed to expire for the first time in 2009 under the Obama administration. The program was reauthorized under the SOAR Act in 2011, but again defunded at the end of the second Obama presidency.  The program was reinstated under President Trump.\n\nBackground\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush signed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide scholarships to students from low-income families to attend a private school of choice. The program targeted 2,000 children from low-income families in Washington D.C. These children were given funding to help offset the cost of private schooling. In 2008, the program funded attendance at 54 D.C. private schools for students from families with an average income of $22,736, \"or about 107 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four.\"\n\nIn 2009 the program faced a phase out with President Barack Obama's 2009 budget proposal cutting all funding for the program and including language to prohibit any new students from receiving scholarships.\n\nIn 2011, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senator Joe Lieberman introduced the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act to restore funding for the program and again allow new students to participate. The entirety of the SOAR Act was included in the 2011 long-term continuing resolution, the passage of which resulted in a five-year reauthorization of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The 2004 legislation had permitted students to receive scholarships of up to $7,500, whereas the 2011 bill provides scholarships of up to $8,000 for students in kindergarten through eighth grade and up to $12,000 for students in grades 9-12.\n\nIn February 2012, President Barack Obama announced his budget proposal for 2013, which did not include new funding for the program. According to ABC News, the budget stated that the program's budget for 2012 had enough money to also cover students' vouchers in 2013, but did not mention future years. The lack of funding was criticized by conservatives, including The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley, who argued that the program costs less per child and has a higher graduation rate than public schools in Washington D.C.\n\nProgram Administrator \nBetween 2004 and 2010, the Washington Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit group, administered the program, which was funded at $12 million a year.\n\nAs of May 2010, the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation is serving as the administrator of the  D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program is appropriated to receive $20 million per year,  beginning in the 2012-13 school year.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, board members of the D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation voted to dissolve the organization because of debt caused by large staff costs, including misuse of the organization's credit cards. By cutting employees' salaries, abandoning its office lease, and cutting other costs, the organization will try to deliver some of the promised grant funding in 2016.\n\nFunding Status\n\n2011 \n Appropriation: $17,369,000\n\n2010 \n Appropriation: $13,200,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n\n2009 \n Appropriations: $14,000,000\n\n2008 \n Appropriations: $14,800,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,694,186\n\n2007 \n Appropriations: $13,860,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,454,200\n\n2006 \n Appropriations: $13,860,000\n Number of New Awards Anticipated: 0\n Number of Continuation Awards: 1\n Average Continuation Award: $12,454,200\n\n2005 \n Appropriations: $13,888,000\n\n2004 \n Appropriations: $13,917,400\n\nNote: FY 2004 was the first year of funding for this program. Funds are appropriated to the District of Columbia to be administered and awarded by the Department of Education. Annual funding status estimates provided by U.S. Department of Education.\n\nSupport and success\nThe program has received support from a number of prominent D.C. politicians, including former mayor Anthony A. Williams, former D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous and former D.C. Board of Education president Peggy Cooper Cafritz. It was opposed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray.\n\nIn 2010, a randomized controlled trial conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students. While the study reported that there \"is no conclusive evidence that the OSP affected student achievement,\" the program was found to have a significant impact on graduation rates. Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%. By comparison, the rate for students who did not receive vouchers was only 70%. The study received the Department of Education's highest rating for scientific rigor. Over 90% of the study's participants were African American, and most of the remainder were Latino American.\n\nFurther research found that students who received vouchers were 25% more likely to enroll in college than students with similar demographic characteristics who did not receive vouchers.\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States federal education legislation", "machine_text": "The D.C.

The program aims to provide educational opportunities to students from low-income families who may not have access to high-quality educational options. Students who are eligible for the program must reside in Washington D.C. and meet certain income requirements. Scholarship recipients can use the funds to attend participating private schools in the city. The program has been controversial since its inception, with supporters arguing that it provides educational opportunities to students who would not otherwise have them. Opponents argue that the program drains resources from public schools and undermines public education. In 2019, the program was reauthorized for five years as part of a larger spending package. The reauthorization included changes to the program, including increased accountability measures for private schools participating in the program. As of the 2020-2021 school year, there were approximately 1,700 students participating in the program. The program has been credited with increasing graduation rates and expanding educational options for low-income students in Washington D.C.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"8 Women\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "8 Women () is a 2002 dark comedy musical film written and directed by François Ozon. Based on the 1958 play by Robert Thomas, it features an ensemble cast of high-profile French actresses that includes Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Béart, Fanny Ardant, Virginie Ledoyen, Danielle Darrieux, Ludivine Sagnier and Firmine Richard. Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s, the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate Christmas in an isolated, snowbound cottage only to find Marcel, the family patriarch, dead with a knife in his back. Trapped in the house, every woman becomes a suspect, each having her own motive and secret.\n\nOzon initially envisioned a remake of George Cukor's film The Women (1939), but eventually settled on Thomas's Huit femmes after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so. Drawing inspiration from Cukor's screwball comedies of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as Douglas Sirk, Vincente Minnelli, and Alfred Hitchcock, 8 Women blends farce, melodrama, musical, and murder-mystery film while addressing murder, greed, adultery, and homosexuality. Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house, the film recreates much of the play's original theatrical feel. It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the history of film and the actresses' filmographies.\n\nThe film's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in Paris, where filming had taken place. 8 Women competed for the Golden Bear at the 52nd Berlin International Film Festival, where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution. Released to generally positive reviews, with major praise for the stars, the film was nominated for twelve César Awards, including Best Film. At the 2002 European Film Awards, the film was nominated for six awards, including Best Film and Best Director; it won for Best Actress for the eight principal actresses. It was also selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 75th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.\n\nPlot\nThe film is set in the 1950s in a large country residence as a family and its servants are preparing for Christmas. When the master of the house is discovered dead in his bed with a dagger in his back, it is presumed that the murderer must be one of the eight women in the house. Over the course of the investigation, each woman has a tale to tell and secrets to hide.\n\nThe film opens with Suzon returning from school for Christmas break, finding her mother Gaby, her younger sister Catherine, and her wheelchair-bound grandmother Mamy in the living room, where most of the action of the film takes place. Their conversation drifts to the subject of the patriarch of the family, Marcel, and Catherine leads the first song of the film, \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (roughly, \"Dad, you're out of touch\"). The singing wakes up Suzon and Catherine's aunt Augustine, who initiates arguments with the rest of the family and the two servants (Madame Chanel and Louise), eventually returning upstairs and threatening to commit suicide. Mamy jumps out of her wheelchair trying to stop her, haphazardly explaining her ability to walk as a \"Christmas miracle.\" Augustine is eventually calmed down, and she sings her song of longing, \"Message personnel\" (Personal Message).\n\nThe maid takes a tray upstairs, finds Marcel's stabbed body, and screams. Catherine goes up to see what has happened and locks the door. The others finally go up to Marcel's room to see him stabbed in the back. Catherine tells the others that they should not disturb the room until the police arrive, so they re-lock the door. Realizing that the dogs did not bark the night before the incident, it becomes clear that the murderer was known to the dogs and therefore must be one of the women in the house. Attempting to call the authorities, they find that the telephone line has been cut, so they will have to go in person to the police station. Before they can do so, the women are distracted by the announcement that someone is roaming the garden, someone whom the guard dogs are not chasing. The person turns out to be Marcel's sister Pierrette, a nightclub singer who is also rumored to be a prostitute, and who has not been allowed into the house before due to Gaby's dislike for her. When questioned, she claims that she received a mysterious telephone call in which she was informed that her brother was dead. She sings \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (What's the point of living free?), commenting on her sexual freedom.\n\nIt is realized that she has been to the house before, as the dogs did not bark and she knew immediately which room belonged to her brother, making her the eighth potential killer. The women try to start the car, and find that it has been sabotaged, cutting them off from help until the storm subsides and they can hitchhike to town. The women spend their time trying to identify the murderer amongst them. It is learned that Suzon returned the night before to tell her father in secret that she was pregnant. She sings a song to Catherine, \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\"), about her lover; however, she was sexually abused by her father. We later learn that Suzon is not Marcel's child but is the child of Gaby's first great love who was killed not long after the child was conceived; every time Gaby looks at Suzon she is reminded of her love for him.\n\nSuspicion then swings to Madame Chanel, the housekeeper, whose actions the night before seem suspicious. It is revealed that she had been having an affair with Pierrette, who went to see her brother that night to ask for money to pay off her debts. When some members of the family react in outrage to the fact that she is a lesbian, Madame Chanel retreats to the kitchen, and sings \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (So as to not live alone).\n\nIn the meantime we find out that Mamy, Suzon and Catherine's \"old and sick\" grandmother, not only can walk but also possesses some valuable stock shares that could have saved Marcel from his bankruptcy. Out of greed, she lied that her shares had been stolen by someone who knew where she was hiding them. The spotlight moves to Louise, the new maid, who is found out to be Marcel's mistress. She declares affection for Gaby, but also expresses disappointment in her for her weakness and indecision. She sings \"Pile ou face\" (literally \"Heads or Tails\", but referring to the ups and downs of life), and removes the symbols of her servitude, her maid's cap and apron, asserting herself as an equal to the other women. Gaby sings \"Toi Jamais\" (Never You), about Marcel, saying that he never paid enough attention to her, while other men did. It is revealed that she had an affair with Marcel's business partner, Jacques Farneaux, the same man who has been having an affair with Pierrette. The two women get into a fight that turns into a passionate make-out session on the living room floor, a scene which the others walk in on and are stunned by.\n\nEventually, Madame Chanel discovers the solution to the mystery, but she is silenced by a gunshot. While not struck by the bullet, she becomes mute out of shock. Catherine takes the lead, revealing that she hid in her father's closet from where she saw all the other women talk to Marcel the night before. She explains the mystery: Marcel faked his own death, with her help, to see what was really going on in his house. She says that he is now free of the other women's clutches and rushes to his bedroom only to witness Marcel shoot himself in the head. Mamy closes the film with the song \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (There is no happy love) as the women clasp hands and face the audience.\n\nCast\n Danielle Darrieux as Mamy, the matriarch\n Isabelle Huppert as Augustine, her tachycardiac daughter\n Catherine Deneuve as Gaby, her other daughter, the victim's wife\n Fanny Ardant as Pierrette, the victim's sister\n Emmanuelle Béart as Louise, the new chambermaid\n Virginie Ledoyen as Suzon, the victim's elder daughter\n Ludivine Sagnier as Catherine, the victim's younger daughter\n Firmine Richard as Madame Chanel, the cook\n Dominique Lamure as Marcel, the victim, Gaby's husband\n Romy Schneider as the chambermaid's previous mistress (the photograph)\n\nMusical numbers\n \"Papa t'es plus dans le coup\" (\"Dad, You're Out of Touch\") - Catherine and Company\n \"Message personnel\" (\"Personal Message\") - Augustine\n \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (\"What's the Point of Living Free?\") - Pierrette\n \"Mon amour, mon ami\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\") - Suzon\n \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (\"So as Not to Live Alone\") - Madame Chanel\n \"Pile ou face\" (\"Heads or Tails / Ups and Downs\") - Louise\n \"Toi jamais\" (\"Never You\") - Gaby\n \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (\"There is No Happy Love\") - Mamy\n\nProduction\nOzon was inspired by the 1950s Ross Hunter productions of Douglas Sirk and Alfred Hitchcock. To achieve the look of the latter two director's films, Ozon had costume designer Pascaline Chavanne fashion an original costume for each character. Chavanne was inspired by Dior's New Look and the earlier film costumes of Edith Head. Composer Krishna Levy also provided an instrumental score evocative of Bernard Herrmann, with touches of Miklós Rózsa and Elmer Bernstein, as well as a soundtrack featuring eight songs performed unexpectedly by the film's title characters.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\n8 Women received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 124 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. Its consensus states \"Featuring some of the best French actresses working today, 8 Women is frothy, delirious, over-the-top fun.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 64/100 rating, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJonathan Curiel of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that 8 Women was \"a movie that is so original, so funny, so alive with drama, intrigue, mystery and colors that you want to see it again and again\", citing it the \"new masterpiece\" in Ozon's filmography. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave 8 Women three out of four stars. He noted that the film \"is in no sense serious about murder, its plot, or anything else. It's an elaborate excuse to have fun with its cast,\" adding: \"Watching 8 Women, you have a silly grin half of the time.\" He concluded that \"Movies like 8 Women are essentially made for movie-lovers. You have to have seen overdecorated studio musicals, and you have to know who Darrieux and Deneuve and Beart and Huppert and Ardant are, to get the full flavor.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly felt that \"what does matter is that a phalanx of France's most famous actresses play a gay peekaboo with their own images in the guise of replicating a '50s technicolored production. The result is weightless entertainment that's both camp and true, a warped adoration of star-quality actresses as amazing creatures who can project the lives of fictional characters as well as the essence of their own fabulous selves. Hollywood, start your remake.\"\n\nThe Washington Post writer Ann Hornaday called the film \"a gorgeous, if disjointed, spectacle, made endurable—if not entirely comprehensible—by its eye-popping cast.\" She found that the picture \"retains a stagy quality of heightened theatricality\" and that \"with its bold, luxurious palette and hard-candy surfaces, the film seems less photographed than forged out of silk and nail lacquer.\" Rolling Stones Peter Travers concurred: \"All eight women are something to see and marvel at. Whatever you call this one-of-a-kind bonbon spiked with wit and malice, it's classic oo-la-la.\" He rated the comedy three out of four stars. A. O. Scott from The New York Times said, \"The high-minded critical term of art for such a decadent delight is 'guilty pleasure,' but a movie like this reveals that stuffy phrase to be both a redundancy and an oxymoron. 8 Women is indefensible, cynical, even grotesque; it is also pure—that is to say innocent and uncorrupted—fun.\" Less enthusiastic with the film, Salon.com wrote that \"despite the all-star cast of beautiful, talented actresses, this French whodunit never lives up to the grand musicals it rips off.\"\n\nSpecific performances were cited for acclaim. Huppert's portrayal of Augustine was met with praise. Curiel wrote that \"Huppert's song and dance—and her whole performance in the movie—is a study in determination. Huppert has a reputation for her intense portrayals, and in 8 Women, she steals every scene she's in as the uptight, melodramatic, bespectacled aunt.\" Ardant also received praise for her performance with Hornaday saying that \"the showstopper is Ardant, who in a sensational turn combining the earthiness of Ava Gardner and the fire of Rita Hayworth, explodes with an elemental force all her own. Ardant alone is worth the price of admission to 8 Women.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film was released on 6 February 2002 in France and opened at #3 in 493 theaters, grossing $5,246,358 in the opening weekend. It grossed $18,991,866 in the domestic market.

She studied art in Paris and Berlin, before returning to Norway in the early 1930s to embark on her artistic career. After a period of experimentation and the establishment of her own style, Gleditsch found success with her distinctive abstract paintings of landscapes, still lifes, and portraits. She was one of the first Norwegian artists to embrace abstraction, and her works have influenced generations of Scandinavian painters. Gleditsch was a member of the Norwegian Association of Fine Arts and exhibited widely in Norway and internationally. Her work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1956 and at the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh in 1961. She also participated in group shows in Paris, New York, and Stockholm. In the 1950s, Gleditsch was commissioned to create a mural for Oslo City Hall. The resulting work, \"Nature, Industry, and Culture,\" is a stunning example of her distinctive style and reflects her interest in the relationship between nature and civilization.

The editors of The Handbook of British Chronology have placed his date of accession between 879 and 889 and his death between 890 and 896 with a terminal end date of 900. This date is confirmed by the fact that Asser, Wulfsige's successor, was signing charters as bishop of Sherborne in 900. However, it has recently been suggested that Wulfsige of Sherborne might have been the same Wulfsige who succeeded Heahstan as bishop of London around 900, making 900 the approximate year of Wulfsige's transfer rather than his death.\n\nEducational reform under Alfred the Great\nWulfsige was a contemporary of King Alfred the Great, who had undertaken an effort of educational reform in his realm, personally translating into English what he considered the works “most necessary for all men to know.” When Alfred translated the Pastorale of Pope Gregory the Great, he sent a copy to each of his bishops, including Wulfsige, and added a prefatory letter explaining his educational aims and requesting the bishops to educate young men so that they could read these great works, originally composed in Latin. The copy sent to Wulfsige, which includes his name in the preface, survives as MS Ii.2.4 at Cambridge University Library. It is one of only five which are extant today and was the original from which copies were made in the eleventh century.\n\nWhen Werferth, bishop of Worcester, translated Gregory's Dialogues into English, Alfred sent an exemplar to Wulfsige, who composed a poem that was included as a preface to the work.

Wulfsige was appointed as the Bishop of Sherborne in 1002 by King Æthelred the Unready. His appointment came at a difficult time for England, which was facing increased Viking raids and internal political turmoil. Wulfsige's role as bishop included both spiritual and temporal responsibilities, including overseeing the Church's lands, managing the local economy, and providing education and religious services to the local population. During his tenure as bishop, Wulfsige is believed to have been involved in efforts to reform the Church in England. This included promoting the observance of canonical laws and improving the morality of the clergy. He was also known for his efforts to promote education, particularly among the clergy and the nobility. In 1012, Wulfsige was forced to flee Sherborne when the town was attacked by Danish Vikings. He is believed to have sought refuge in the nearby town of Winchester, where he continued to serve as a bishop until his death in 1023. Despite the challenges he faced during his tenure as bishop, Wulfsige is remembered as an important figure in the history of the Church in England. His commitment to education and moral reform helped pave the way for future developments in the Church, and his leadership during a difficult period in England's history demonstrated his strength as a bishop and a spiritual leader.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 13112783}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harbour Solutions\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harbour Solutions is a Canadian public infrastructure project in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe CAD $333 million project comprised the construction of three sewage treatment plants and connected various sewage pipe networks with lift stations to treat all sanitary sewage in Halifax and Dartmouth. It was completed in 2010.\n\nHistory\nFor two and a half centuries prior to this project, raw sewage was discharged untreated directly into Halifax Harbour.  The harbour waters have been the recipient of approximately 200 million litres of untreated raw sewage every day, enough to fill 25 Olympic-size swimming pools. Shellfish harvesting from the harbour and swimming within the harbour have been prohibited for health reasons.\n\nThe historic settlements of Halifax and Dartmouth were built with no thought to sewage treatment as a means of waste disposal. Throughout the 19th century, sewers were designed as a single system, with no separation between sanitary sewers, which carried domestic human waste, and stormwater drainage systems. The combined sewers simply emptied into the harbour from dozens of outfalls at the bottom of each street that met the waterfront.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, it was clear that the system was not environmentally sustainable. Millions of litres of sewage were dumped into the harbour daily, consisting not only of simple human waste, but of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, and a host of other harmful material.\n\nSewage treatment plants were proposed for both Halifax and Dartmouth beginning in the 1970s, however, the separate municipalities were never able to reach a consensus for system design and construction.  That decade saw the Halifax Regional Water Commission begin to charge its customers a pollution surcharge which was intended to fund such a system.  Meanwhile, a host of different provincial and federal governments came and went and overall funding was never finalized.  It was only following municipal amalgamation which saw the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth dissolved and merged with all municipalities in Halifax County to form the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996 that the sewage treatment issue gained necessary traction and moved beyond the planning stage.\n\nCurrent project\nUnder the Harbour Solutions Project, a treatment system has been under construction since the early 2000s with three plants being built (one in downtown Halifax, one in downtown Dartmouth, and one in Herring Cove on the southwest side of the harbour) as well as extensive collector piping to close all sewage outfalls into the harbour and redirect sewage into the treatment plants.  Total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately CA$333 million. \nOn February 11, 2008, the treatment facility in downtown Halifax officially commenced operation. The Dartmouth plant came online on July 10, 2008 and the Herring Cove plant was expected to open in late fall 2008.\n\nHarbour sewage is also mitigated to a lesser extent by the aforementioned existing plants at Mill Cove, in Bedford and another at Eastern Passage.\n\nResults\nThe Halifax Regional Municipality announced on July 9, 2008 that the harbour beaches, Black Rock Beach at Point Pleasant Park and the beach at Dingle Park would re-open to swimming on August 2, 2008.  Fecal coliform bacteria levels at these locations were either undetectable or at safe levels for swimming. Eleven lifeguards would patrol the beaches.\nThe improved water quality in Halifax Harbour during the summer of 2008 was a direct result of the newly operating Halifax and Dartmouth sewage plants.  The clarity of the water improved to the point where the municipal government hired commercial divers to remove debris from the floor of the harbour along the popular boardwalk in the Historic Properties; prior to that summer, the debris was seldom visible due to the opaque water as a result of the untreated sewage.\n\n2009 breakdown\nHowever repeated breakdowns of the system in 2008 resulted in regular beach closures again and complaints about foul odours and sewage filled basements. A massive failure of the central plant in January 2009 caused raw sewage to again be poured into the Harbour.\n\nThe 2009 breakdown was caused by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called \"a perfect storm\" of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant, but the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's \"wet well\" from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, only one of the four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the electrical junction boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.\n\nThe incident brought criticism from the federal government and the public, and city officials promised to get the plant back online by Spring 2010. On June 25, 2010, the Halifax Wastewater Treatment Plant was returned to full operation, and it was announced that Black Rock Beach and Dingle Park Beach would be safe for swimming again.\n\nSewage discharged\nUntreated sewage continues to be discharged into Halifax harbour due to severed sewer lines during construction of the new treatment plant.\n\nSee also\n Saint John, New Brunswick harbour cleanup\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Harbour Solutions\n\nBuildings and structures in Halifax, Nova Scotia\nEnvironment of Canada\nHealth in Canada\nHistory of Halifax, Nova Scotia\nSewage treatment plants in Canada\nWater supply and sanitation in Canada", "machine_text": "Harbour Solutions is an innovative software development company that specializes in providing technology solutions and consulting services to the maritime industry.

Some early major midget car manufacturers include Kurtis Kraft (1930s to 1950s) and Solar (1944–46). Midgets are intended to be driven for races of relatively short distances, usually 2.5 to 25 miles (4 to 40 km). Some events are staged inside arenas, like the Chili Bowl held in early January at the Tulsa Expo Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Early midget races were held on board tracks previously used for bicycle racing. When the purpose built speedway at Gilmore Stadium was completed, racing ended at the school stadium, and hundreds of tracks began to spring up across the United States. Angell Park Speedway in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (near Madison) is another major track in the United States operating since the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe AAA Contest Board soon started sanctioning midget races across the country, facing opposition from independent drivers and racetracks. After the AAA withdrew from sanctioning races in 1955, the United States Auto Club took over as the major sanctioning body of midget car racing in the United States. NASCAR had a midget division from 1952 to 1968.\n\nSoon after in Australia, speedcar racing became popular with the first Australian Speedcar Championship being contested in Melbourne in 1935, its popularity running through the country's \"golden era\" of the 1950s and 1960s. Australian promoters such as Adelaide's Kym Bonython who ran the Rowley Park Speedway, and Empire Speedways who ran the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and the famous Sydney Showground Speedway, often imported drivers from the US, such as the popular Jimmy Davies. Promoters in Australia during this period often staged races billed as either a \"world speedcar championship\" or \"world speedcar derby\". During this time speedcars were arguably the most popular category in Australian speedway with crowds of up to 30,000 attending meetings at the Sydney Showground and over 10,000 in Adelaide and Brisbane.\n\nSpeedcars continue to race in Australia, with the major events being the Australian Championship, and the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix (first run in 1938). Along with various state championships, there is also the Speedcar Super Series which travels throughout Australia. Speedcar crowds of 10,000 people are common in Australia for these major events.\n\nIn December 2013, POWRi Midget Racing began a 16-event Lucas Oil POWRi Midget World Championship that ran until June 2014. Drivers competed in New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2013–14 season and ended in the United States.\n\nMidget car racing also grew in popularity in the Northeast of the United States, in part due to racers like Bill Schindler and events at tracks like that at Hinchcliffe Stadium.\n\nStepping stone to high profile divisions \nMany IndyCar and NASCAR drivers used midget car racing as an intermediate stepping stone on their way to more high-profile divisions, including Tony Stewart, Sarah Fisher, Jeff Gordon, A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Kasey Kahne, Ryan Newman, Kyle Larson , Art Pollard  and others. The events are sometimes held on weeknights so that popular and famous drivers from other, higher-profiled types of motor racing (who race in those higher-profiled types of racing on the weekends) will be available to compete, and so that it does not conflict with drivers' home tracks.\n\nNotable midget car races \nIn 1959 Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports cars by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, usually used on oval tracks. Ward used an advantageous power-to-weight ratio and dirt-track cornering abilities to steal the win.\n\nNotable annual midget car racing events \n Chili Bowl – Tulsa Expo Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n Fireman Nationals – Angell Park Speedway, Sun Prairie, Wisconsin\n Four Crown Nationals – Eldora Speedway, Allen Township, Darke County, Ohio\n Hut Hundred – Terre Haute Action Track, Terre Haute, Indiana\n Bryan Clauson Classic - Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Speedway, Indiana\n Night before the 500 – O'Reilly Raceway Park, Indianapolis, Indiana\n The Rumble in Fort Wayne – Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Expo Center, Fort Wayne, Indiana\n Turkey Night Grand Prix – Ventura Raceway, Irwindale Speedway\n World 50-lap Classic – Western Springs Stadium, Auckland, New Zealand\n New Zealand Midget Championship – Rotates on various tracks throughout New Zealand\n Australian Speedcar Championship – Rotates on various tracks throughout Australia\n Australian Speedcar Grand Prix – Rotates between tracks throughout eastern Australia\n Magic Man 34 – Perth Motorplex Speedway, Kwinana Beach, Western Australia\n Tim Crouch Memorial – Murray Bridge Speedway, Murray Bridge, South Australia\n Boston Louie Memorial – Seekonk Speedway, Seekonk, Massachusetts\n\nSanctioning bodies\n\nAustralia \n SpeedcarsAustralia.com – Official website of Australia's Speedcar governing body, Speedcars Australia Inc\n QSRA – Queensland Speedcar Racing Assos.

These small, lightweight vehicles are designed to be fast and nimble, making them perfect for racing on short tracks or dirt ovals. While midget car racing is most commonly associated with dirt track racing, it has also been run on pavement, most notably in the Indianapolis 500. The history of midget car racing dates back to the 1920s, when full-size cars were modified for racing on dirt tracks. However, these early cars were heavy and unwieldy, and it wasn't until the 1930s that dedicated midget race cars were developed. These early midgets were powered by four-cylinder engines and featured small, lightweight bodies that were aerodynamically designed for speed and agility. Over the years, midget car racing has evolved and changed, with new technologies and materials being used to build faster, more powerful cars. Today's midgets are still small and lightweight, but they are also incredibly fast, capable of reaching speeds of over 130 miles per hour. One of the most iconic midget car races is the Chili Bowl Nationals, which is held every year in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This four-day event attracts drivers from all over the world and is considered one of the most prestigious races in the sport. Other notable midget car races include the USAC National Midget Series and the Western Midget Racing Series. Midget car racing has produced a number of notable drivers over the years, including Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon, and J.J. Yeley. However, the sport is also known for its grassroots appeal, with many local and regional tracks hosting midget races for drivers of all skill levels. Despite its popularity, midget car racing can be dangerous, with crashes and injuries a common occurrence. However, with proper safety equipment and track maintenance, the sport can be enjoyed safely by drivers and spectators alike.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 683114}

It seeks to understand how drugs affect the human body as a single complex biological system. \nInstead of considering the effect of a drug to be the result of one specific drug-protein interaction, systems pharmacology considers the effect of a drug to be the outcome of the network of interactions a drug may have. In 1992, an article on systems medicine and pharmacology was published in China. Networks of interaction may include chemical-protein, protein–protein, genetic, signalling and physiological (at cellular, tissue, organ and whole body levels).

It is a research approach that aims to study the interactions between drugs and multiple biological systems, such as cell signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and gene expression regulation. The goal of systems pharmacology is to identify the mechanisms of action of drugs, their intended and unintended effects on biological systems, and the influence of genetic and environmental factors on drug responses. It relies on the use of computational models, large-scale data analyses, and experimental methods to investigate drug-target interactions, drug metabolism, and drug disposition. Systems pharmacology has several applications in drug development, personalized medicine, and disease management. For instance, it can aid in identifying new drug targets, designing more effective drug combinations, and optimizing drug dosing. It can also help in predicting drug toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and drug resistance. The development of systems pharmacology has been facilitated by the advances in technology, such as high-throughput screening assays, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. These technologies enable the collection of vast amounts of data on biological systems and drug responses, which can be integrated to develop comprehensive models of drug action. In summary, systems pharmacology is a multidisciplinary field that is transforming drug development and healthcare by providing a more holistic and dynamic understanding of drug action and disease mechanisms. It offers a powerful tool for predicting drug effects, optimizing drug therapy, and advancing personalized medicine.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38736538}

These figurines have been dated to around 23,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic period. They are notable for their unique physical characteristics, which have led to speculation about the beliefs and rituals of the people who created them. The Venus figurines of Gagarino are small, roughly carved sculptures made from ivory, bone, and stone. They are typically between 4 and 8 centimeters tall and have exaggerated body parts, especially the hips and breasts. Some of the figurines also have incised lines that suggest clothing or other adornments. The significance of these figurines is debated among historians and archaeologists. Some argue that they were objects of worship or fertility symbols, while others see them as representations of human beings or simply decorative items. However, their similarities to other female figurines found throughout Europe suggest that they were part of a larger cultural tradition. One theory about the Venus figurines of Gagarino is that they were used in shamanic rituals. The exaggerated features of the figurines may have been intended to represent the mystical powers of the women who were the focus of these rituals. Alternatively, the figurines may have been used in ancestor worship or as part of funerary practices. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the Venus figurines of Gagarino, they offer an intriguing glimpse into the beliefs and practices of prehistoric societies. They are valued not only for their historical importance but also for their aesthetic beauty and the skill of their makers.

It was pioneered in 1851 by William Nobles, who discovered an easy shortcut between the Applegate Trail in Nevada and the Lassen Trail in California. The trail was extensively used until the 1870s, when it was superseded by railroads.\n\nDiscovery and establishment\nThe main trail to California in the 1840s was the California Trail, which followed the Humboldt River in Nevada, then the Truckee River, and over the Donner Pass in California. A northern variation was pioneered by the Applegate brothers in 1846, using a more northerly route that connected with destinations in Oregon. Peter Lassen established a variant route that passed Lassen Peak on the way to the Sacramento area. Lassen scouted the area of Honey Lake with William H. Nobles for a legendary \"Gold Lake\", but having failed, they parted company, with Nobles continuing to the east and accidentally scouting a shorter, easier trail than Lassen's.\n\nNobles, born in New York in 1816, had moved to Minnesota in 1841 to work as a carpenter, then as a carpenter and wagon-maker. By 1851 he had moved on to California. When Nobles returned to California from his expedition with Lassen, he showed a party of  businessmen the route for a fee of $2000. With the subscribers vouching for the usefulness of the  route, he returned to Minnesota in 1853 to promote the route, marrying in Illinois along the way. The Minnesota legislature commissioned Nobles to present the route to Congress in Washington. Nobles' efforts persuaded Congress to appropriate $300,000 for an expedition along the route, led by Frederick W. Lander, who prepared a favorable report in February 1861. The route became known as the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Nobles was elected to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and died in St. Paul in 1876. The trail was briefly considered for a railroad route. Its popularity contributed to the founding of Susanville and Redding.\n\nHistoric designation\nThe  section of trail within the boundaries of Lassen Volcanic National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1975. The section within the park is maintained as a hiking trail.\n\nThe trail has two California Historical Landmark markers: #675 marks a stopping place along the Noble Emigrant Trail that William Nobles established near the present-day city of Susanville, while #677 marks the spot where Peter Lassen first saw Honey Lake on October 4, 1850, while on his search for \"Gold Lake\".\n\nLassen Volcanic National Park\nThe trail within the park starts in the northeast corner, passing the edge of the Cinder Cone and the Fantastic Lava Beds, then skirting Prospect Peak. Crossing Badger Flats and passing through the Devastated Area associated with the May 21, 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak. The trail parallels the Lassen Park Road, then passes between the Chaos Crags and Table Mountain, across Sunflower Flat and over Nobles Pass, following the edge of the Chaos Jumbles.

It was named after William H. Nobles, who mapped out the route and led a wagon train of emigrants from Missouri to California in 1851. The trail became a popular route for travelers seeking a new life in California during the California Gold Rush. The trail was approximately 1,000 miles and started at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, and ended in Sacramento, California. It followed the Humboldt River Basin in Nevada and crossed the Sierra Nevada mountains near Carson Pass. The route was rugged, and travelers encountered several challenges along the way, including lack of water and food, rough terrain, and extreme weather conditions. In 1852, over 10,000 emigrants used the Nobles Emigrant Trail to reach California. However, with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the trail became less popular and was eventually abandoned. Today, the Nobles Emigrant Trail remains an essential part of California's history. Several historical landmarks and markers pay tribute to the trail and the hardships that emigrants faced while traveling westward. In Nevada, a historical marker commemorates the infamous \"Donner Pass,\" where a group of emigrants endured a brutal winter and resorted to cannibalism to survive. In California, a historical marker at Carson Pass commemorates the trail's crossing over the Sierra Nevada mountains. The marker provides information about the trail and the history of emigration to California.

It is a 7.5-kilometer-long river that flows through the cities of Quezon City, Mandaluyong, San Juan, and Manila. The river is a tributary of Pasig River, which is the main river that flows through Metro Manila. The San Juan River has a significant historical and cultural value as it played a crucial role in the country's history during the Spanish period. It was used as a means of transportation for goods and people, and it was also a strategic location for trading activities. The river was also known for the abundance of fish and other marine life that provided a livelihood for the people living nearby. In recent years, San Juan River has faced environmental challenges due to rapid urbanization and industrialization in Metro Manila, resulting in high levels of pollution and degradation of the river's ecosystem. This prompted the government to take action in rehabilitating the river to improve its water quality and restore its ecological balance. In 2010, the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) initiated the San Juan River Rehabilitation Program with the aim of cleaning up the river and reviving its natural habitat. The program involved the construction of facilities such as sewage treatment plants and the installation of water quality monitoring systems to ensure that the river's water stays clean and healthy. The San Juan River Rehabilitation Program also engages the local communities in its activities to promote environmental awareness and encourage participation in cleaning up and preserving the river. The program has seen significant improvements in the water quality of the river, and it continues to work towards the full rehabilitation and restoration of the San Juan River's ecosystem. Today, San Juan River is an important part of the Pasig River's ecosystem, and its rehabilitation and preservation serve as a testament to the importance of protecting and conserving the environment for future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31580275}

It spent one week on the UK Albums Chart at number 48, a marked contrast to the top 10 debut of their preceding album, The Infotainment Scan. The album's full title is Middle Class Revolt A/K/A The Vapourisation Of Reality. Drummer Karl Burns features for the first time since 1985's This Nation's Saving Grace, having rejoined the band in 1993.\n\nContent\nThe album included two songs previously released as singles, \"Behind the Counter\" (December 1993 – UK no. 75) and \"15 Ways\" (April 1994 – UK no. 65), although different versions of both were included on the album. A further five tracks from the album featured as B-sides across the formats of these singles, and, although most were different versions, this meant that the album only contained seven songs that were new to fans upon its release, three of which were cover versions. In addition, \"Hey! Student\" is a reworked version of \"Hey! Fascist\", which The Fall used to play live in their early days (as shown by its inclusion on Live 1977). The version of \"M5\" included was considered inferior to the version released on the Behind the Counter EP in 1993.\n\nThe album's cover versions were less mainstream than some of their other recent choices: \"War\", originally by Henry Cow and Slapp Happy, \"Shut Up!\", originally by The Monks (whom The Fall had already covered twice on 1990s Extricate) and a bizarre version of \"Junk Man\", originally by The Groundhogs. According to Daryl Easlea's sleeve notes for the 2006 reissue, Mark E. Smith prevailed upon the group to deliver the song from memory and, as a result, was backed by minimal drums, bass, kazoo and some tuneless hollering from Burns. \"Symbol of Mordgan\" is based upon a recording of Scanlon discussing a football match by telephone on John Peel's Saturday afternoon programme.\n\nMiddle Class Revolt is, as Easlea notes, not a uniformly popular album amongst the group's fans. Nevertheless, it houses some popular tracks. Indeed, \"Hey! Student\" attained the number 2 position in John Peel's 1994 Festive Fifty, beaten to the top only by Inspiral Carpets' \"I Want You\", which featured Smith as guest vocalist.\n\nReception\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = AllMusic\n| rev1Score = \n| rev2      = The Boston Globe\n| rev2Score = favourable<ref name=\"Sullivan\">Sullivan, Jim (1994) \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20180225205636/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8295283.html The Fall Middle Class Revolt aka The Vapourisation of Reality]\", The Boston Globe, 8 September 1994.

Jim Sullivan, for The Boston Globe, stated the album has \"enough caustic barbs and wry witticisms snake through the dense mix to provide cerebral fun for those who like to carp along\", going on to say \"It's nasty, it's gleeful, it's the Fall still twisting the ironic/angry knife.\" Mark Jenkins, in The Washington Post'', described it as \"unusually smooth for an album by these veteran British post-punk eccentrics\" viewing its highlights to be \"its irascible mantras, notably the unusually quick-tempoed \"Hey! Student\" and the dense \"Shut Up!\"\". Stereogum's Robert Ham viewed it as their \"best album in at least five years\".\n\nTrack listing\nThe album was controversial for its writing credits, in which all Fall originals were credited to Mark E. Smith, Craig Scanlon and Steve Hanley, despite some of the tracks having already been credited differently on the preceding single releases. According to drummer Simon Wolstencroft (who claimed to have co-written \"Middle Class Revolt\" and \"City Dweller\"), there was \"a misprint on the credits due to a cock-up at the record label\".\n\nSome CD editions erroneously list \"War\" as track 13, although the actual running order on CD is correct.\n\n2006 edition\nThe album was remastered and reissued by Castle Music as an expanded two-disc set in 2006.

It is a socio-political movement that emerged in the 20th century. Throughout history, the middle class has been the backbone of society, comprising teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals. However, in recent times, the middle class has been increasingly marginalized, with their economic status deteriorating. This leads to a sense of disillusionment and discontent among the middle class and fuels the Middle Class Revolt. One of the primary drivers of the Middle Class Revolt is economic inequality. The middle class sees a widening gap between the rich and poor, with the rich getting richer while the middle class struggles to maintain their standard of living. This leads to a sense of injustice and fuels the revolt. Another factor that contributes to the Middle Class Revolt is political disenchantment. The middle class perceives that the political class is not addressing their concerns and is instead pandering to the interests of the wealthy and powerful. This leads to a growing distrust and disillusionment with the political process and fuels the Middle Class Revolt. The Middle Class Revolt takes various forms, ranging from protests and demonstrations to supporting political parties and candidates that embody their values and concerns. It is driven by the desire for social and economic justice and a fair share of political power. In conclusion, the Middle Class Revolt is a significant social movement that emerges from the growing sense of disenchantment and disillusionment among the middle class. It is driven by economic inequality, political disenchantment, and a desire for social and economic justice. The movement will continue to shape future political and economic policies, and policymakers must take note of their concerns and take steps to address them.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4771378}

Phacium fungi are typically small, with a height range of less than 1mm to 4mm and can be found growing in a variety of habitats including soil and leaf litter. The fruiting body of Phacium appears in the form of black, brown, or reddish-brown discs that are attached to the substrate by a small stalk. These fruiting bodies are also called apothecia and contain the sexual spores or ascospores. Phacium fungi are saprobic, meaning they obtain their nutrients from dead plant and animal material. They are important in the decomposition of plant matter, which recycles carbon and nutrients back into the ecosystem. Phacium has been recorded to cause brown rot of potatoes, but its pathogenicity to humans and other animals remains unknown. There are over 70 species of Phacium, and the genus is widely studied in fungal taxonomy and biodiversity research. Molecular techniques are now being employed to identify and classify Phacium fungi accurately. While there is no known commercial or medicinal use for Phacium fungi, they play a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility and the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, understanding the diversity of Phacium species has implications for agricultural practices and ecosystem management.

Synonyms for the species include Rhogeessa bombyx (Thomas, 1913), Rhogeessa riparia (Goodwin, 1958), and Rhogeessa velilla (Thomas, 1903). The Thomas's yellow bat was formerly included as a subspecies of the black-winged little yellow bat, but was considered distinct in 1996.\n\nThe species needs taxonomic review for a number of reasons. One of these reasons includes the possibility that subspecies of the Thomas's yellow bat may be their own species.\n\nRange and conservation \nThomas's yellow bat is native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It is listed as \"Least Concern\" by the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, having some degree of tolerance to habitat modification, and unlikeliness of population decline at the rate to qualify for a more threatened listing.\n\nBehavior and ecology \nThomas's yellow bat inhabits many habitats, such as both evergreen and deciduous forest, thorn shrub, open areas, and villages, though it appears to favor slightly disturbed deciduous forests. Like other species in its genus, the Thomas's yellow bat can take refuge in buildings and hollow trees, although its roosts are unknown.\n\nThe species is crepuscular, with peaks of activity within an hour of both dusk and of dawn, flying low to the ground along wide trails or roads. The Thomas's yellow bat is an insectivore, feeding on small, flying insects and with established hunting routes among individuals.\n\nThe maximum energy of echolocation calls in the Thomas's yellow bat is 50 to 60 kHz.\n\nSee also \n\n Black-winged little yellow bat\n\nReferences \n\nRhogeessa\nBats of Central America\nBats of South America\nMammals of Colombia\nTaxa named by Oldfield Thomas\nMammals described in 1903", "machine_text": "Thomas's yellow bat, also known as the Thomas's bat, is a species of bat that is native to the Caribbean islands and some parts of South America. The species is recognized for its distinctive yellow coloration and is a popular subject of study among biologists and conservationists. Description Thomas's yellow bat is a relatively small species of bat, with adults typically measuring between 5 and 6 cm in length, and weighing around 5-8 grams. The species gets its name from its bright yellow fur which covers its body and wings, with black-tipped ears and a black face mask. These unique features make it easy to spot in low lighting conditions. Habitat and Distribution Thomas's yellow bat is primarily found in the Caribbean islands and some parts of South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Lesser Antilles. The species favors roosting in caves, old mine shafts, and rock crevices, but can also be found in leaf litter, tree cavities or abandoned buildings. They are known to roost in groups and can be active throughout the year. Diet Thomas's yellow bat feeds primarily on insects such as moths and beetles, which it catches in midair. The species is highly adapted to hunting in low light conditions and has excellent echolocation abilities. Conservation Like many other bat species, Thomas's yellow bat is under threat from habitat loss, hunting, and human disturbances. The species has been listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List. Much research remains to be done on this enigmatic species, in order to better understand its habitat requirements, natural history and conservation needs. Conclusion Thomas's yellow bat is an intriguing bat species, known for its distinctive appearance and impressive echolocation abilities.

The plant derives its name from the Greek word \"amyein,\" which means to suck, which is a reference to their parasitic life cycle. The Amyema plant is a hemiparasitic plant, which means that it lives on trees but still performs photosynthesis through its leaves. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that attach to the branches of the host plant. The plant also has a root system, but it is reduced and may not reach the ground. Amyema plants have adapted to their parasitic lifestyle by developing specialized root-like structures called haustoria that penetrate the bark of the host plant and absorb water, nutrients, and minerals from the host plant. This adaptation helps the plant survive in a nutrient-poor environment and makes them highly successful parasites. The flowers of Amyema plants are small and tubular and are usually red, yellow, or orange in color. They are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies that are attracted to their bright colors and nectar. The fruit of Amyema plants is a small berry that contains one or two seeds. The Amyema plant has a long history of human use. In some cultures, it is used for medicinal purposes to treat various ailments such as fever, cough, and skin diseases. The plant has also been used as a traditional food source by some indigenous communities.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tattooed Serpent\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tattooed Serpent (died 1725) (Natchez: Obalalkabiche; French: Serpent Piqué) was the war chief of the Natchez people of Grand Village, which was located near Natchez in what is now the U.S. state of Mississippi. He and his brother, the paramount chief Great Sun, allied his people with the French colonists. He was a friend of the colonist and chronicler Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz. Du Pratz described their friendship and Tattooed Serpent's death and funeral in detail in his chronicle.\n\nSource of the name\nThe name Obalalkabiche (Tattooed Serpent) was traditionally adopted by the War Chief of the Natchez, who was always the younger brother of the Paramount Chief, whose official name was Yak-stalchil (Great Sun).\nThus, the Tattooed Serpent who died in 1725 and was a friend of Du Pratz was preceded by his own maternal uncle (died 1700), who was also called Tattooed Serpent while in office. On his death in 1725, Tattooed Serpent was succeeded by his sister's second eldest son, who took the same name. As an emblem of the office, he was decorated with the elaborate tattoo of a serpent circling his body from his foot to his mouth.\n\nLife\nIn 1723, Tattooed Serpent helped the French negotiate a peace treaty after the Second Natchez War 1723, which ended the attacks on the French by the Natchez of the White Apple Village. He was such a friend of the French that, according to the chronicle of Dumont de Montigny, his sister, called La Glorieuse by the French, said that \"he was like a Frenchman\".\n\nAt his death, he and his older brother were both succeeded by much younger men. The alliance between the French and the Natchez became unstable, as the leaders of the pro-British White Apple village gained influence. This eventually led to the Natchez Massacre of 1729, and the end of amiable relations between the French and the Natchez.\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nLe Page du Pratz describes in great detail the events surrounding the death of Tattooed Serpent, including his funeral. When he died, his brother, the Paramount Chief Great Sun, was so grief-stricken that he wanted to follow his brother in death by suicide. Le Page du Pratz managed to prevent the Great Sun from doing so.\n\nAt the funeral of Tattooed Serpent, a number of commoner class servants of the War Chief were sacrificed by garrotting, following the Natchez custom. According to du Pratz, two of his wives, one of his sisters (La Glorieuse), his first warrior, his doctor, his head servant and the servant's wife, his nurse, and a craftsman of war clubs all chose to die and be interred with him, as well as several old women. An infant was sacrificed, strangled by his parents. These retainers had their faces painted red and were drugged with large doses of nicotine or Jimson weed before their deaths.\n\nDuring the funeral procession, the chief's body was carried to the temple on a litter made of cane matting and cedar poles. The temple was located on top of a low platform mound. The retainers were ritually strangled at the temple.\n\nTattooed Serpent was buried in a trench inside the temple floor, while his retainers were buried in other locations atop the mound surrounding the temple. After a few months time, the bodies were disinterred and their defleshed bones were stored as bundle burials in the temple.\n\nSee also\nTattooed Arm\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNatchez people\n18th-century Native Americans", "machine_text": "Tattooed serpent is a popular motif in the art of tattooing. The design of a tattooed serpent is known for its intricate and alluring details and has been used in various styles of tattooing for centuries. The tattooed serpent is a representation of a snake, typically depicted in a coiled position with its head raised. The snake is often adorned with elaborate patterns and designs, giving it a unique and captivating appearance. The art of tattooed serpent has a rich history. In many ancient cultures, snakes were seen as powerful symbols of wisdom, rebirth, and transformation. The serpent was also believed to be a powerful guardian or protector, warding off evil spirits and protecting its wearer from harm.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Antares\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Antares (pronounced  ), designated α Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii), is on average the fifteenth-brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a slow irregular variable star that ranges in brightness from apparent magnitude +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as spectral type M1.5Iab-Ib, Antares is a red supergiant, a large evolved massive star and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the Solar System, it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times that of the Sun.\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association, the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, located at the rim of the Upper Scorpius part illuminating the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex in its foreground. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about  from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a binary star, with its two components called α Scorpii A and α Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot main sequence star of magnitude 5.5.\n\nNomenclature\n\nα Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation. Antares has the Flamsteed designation 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the Bright Star Catalogue and HD 148478 in the Henry Draper Catalogue. As a prominent infrared source, it appears in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas catalogue as IRAS 16262–2619. It is also catalogued as a double star WDS J16294-2626 and CCDM J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate variable star designation.\n\nIts traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek , meaning \"rival to-Ares\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars. The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early Mesopotamian astronomers which is considered an outdated speculation because the name of this star in Mesopotamian astronomy has always been \"heart of Scorpon\" and it was associated with Goddess Lisi(n). Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after Antar, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems Mu'allaqat. However, the name \"Antares\" is already proven in the Greek culture, e.g. in Ptolemy's Almagest and Tetrabiblos. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Antares for the star α Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nObservation \nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at opposition to the Sun. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator.\n\nFor two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky from mid-northern latitudes, because it is near conjunction with the Sun. In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64° northern latitude, the star does not rise at all.\n\nAntares is easier to see from the southern hemisphere due to its southerly declination. In the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64° S latitude.\n\nHistory \nRadial velocity variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century and attempts were made to derive spectroscopic orbits.  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by Johann Tobias Bürg during an occultation on April 13, 1819, although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer James William Grant FRSE while in India on 23 July 1844. It was rediscovered by Ormsby M. Mitchel in 1846, and measured by William Rutter Dawes in April 1847.\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.  The brightness has been monitored by the American Association of Variable Star Observers since 1945, and it has been classified as an LC slow irregular variable star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or  days. No separate long secondary period has been detected, although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').\n\nOccultations and conjunctions \n\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the ecliptic, one of four first magnitude stars within 6° of the ecliptic (the others are Spica, Regulus and Aldebaran), so it can be occulted by the Moon. The occultation of 31 July 2009 was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares. Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar nodes. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. Venus, but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400. Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares. Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass south of the star.\n\nIllumination of Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex \nAntares illuminates foreground parts of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The illuminated cloud is sometimes referred to as the Antares Nebula or is otherwise identified as VdB 107, Ced 132, DG 141, LBN 1107 and Magakian 668.\n\nStellar system\nα Scorpii is a double star that is thought to form a binary system. The best calculated orbit for the stars is still considered to be unreliable.  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a semi-major axis of about .  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit, to 2,562 years for a simple Kepler's Law estimate.\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about  apart in 1847–49, or  apart in 1848.  More modern observations consistently give separations around . The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion, but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.\n\nThe pair have a projected separation of about 529 astronomical units (AU) (≈ 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over  beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).\n\nAntares\n\nAntares is a red supergiant star with a stellar classification of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class. Due to the nature of the star, the derived parallax measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately  from the Sun.\n\nThe brightness of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the true bolometric luminosity is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example  and  published in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about , or . Comparison of the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of  and an age of 12 million years (MYr), or an initial mass of  and an age of 11 to 15 MYr. Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as supernovae.\n\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed. In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by 19%. It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind radial velocity changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using interferometry or observing lunar occultations events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 ± 0.1 milliarcseconds has been published. Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a limb-darkened disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as  in 2009 and  in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite's trigonometric parallax of  leads to a radius of about . Older radii estimates exceeding  were derived from older measurements of the diameter, but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths. Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as VY Canis Majoris or VV Cephei A and Mu Cephei.\n\nAntares, like the similarly sized red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion, will almost certainly explode as a supernova, possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.\n\nAntares B\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around , a temperature around , and a radius of about .\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over . It is often described as green, but this is probably either a contrast effect, or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar occultations while Antares is hidden by the Moon.  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.\n\nEtymology and mythology\n\nIn the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In MUL.APIN, which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and denotes the breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara. Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include  from the Arabic قَلْبُ ٱلْعَقْرَبِ . This had been directly translated from the Ancient Greek  .  was a calque of the Greek name rendered in Latin.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Antares may have been known by various names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\"). In ancient Egypt, Antares represented the scorpion goddess Serket (and was the symbol of Isis in the pyramidal ceremonies). It was called tms n hntt \"the red one of the prow\".  \n\nIn Persia Antares was known as Satevis, one of the four \"royal stars\". In India, it with σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii were Jyeshthā (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the nakshatra (Hindu lunar mansions).\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares 心宿二 (Xīnxiù'èr, \"second star of the Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion Xin (心). It was the national star of the Shang Dynasty, and it was sometimes referred to as () because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand call Antares Rēhua, and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rēhua is father of Puanga/Puaka (Rigel), an important star in the calculation of the Māori calendar. The Wotjobaluk Koori people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as Djuit, son of Marpean-kurrk (Arcturus); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (Balayang) as the brother of Bunjil (Altair).\n\nIn culture \n\nAntares appears in the flag of Brazil, which displays 27 stars, each representing a federated unit of Brazil. Antares represents the state of Piauí.\n\nIn Saint Seiya, the popular 1986 manga, the character Milo represents the Scorpius constellation and uses moves and attacks named after its stars - being Antares the strongest one.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Best Ever Image of a Star’s Surface and Atmosphere - First map of motion of material on a star other than the Sun\n\nM-type supergiants\nB-type main-sequence stars\nBinary stars\nSlow irregular variables\nUpper Scorpius\n\nScorpius (constellation)\nAstronomical events in the near future\nScorpii, Alpha\nCD-26 11359\nScorpii, 21\n148478 9\n080763\n6134\nStars with proper names\nTIC objects", "machine_text": "Antares is a red supergiant star located in the constellation Scorpius.

Antares is also known as Alpha Scorpii, as it is the brightest star in the pattern of Scorpius. Antares has a radius estimated to be around 883 times that of the Sun, making it one of the largest known stars. It is also one of the most massive, with a total mass estimated to be around 12 times that of the Sun. Antares is estimated to be around 550 light-years away from Earth. Despite its size and brightness, Antares is a relatively young star, with an estimated age of between 10 and 20 million years. Due to its massive size, Antares is expected to end its life in a supernova explosion, although this is not expected to happen for at least a few hundred thousand years. Antares has a companion star, which is much smaller and cooler than the main star. This companion star is difficult to observe directly due to its proximity to the much brighter main star.

It is the administrative center of Yavoriv Raion and rests approximately  west of the oblast capital, Lviv. Its population is approximately .\n\nNot far from it is the watering-place of Shklo with sulfur springs.\n\nHistory\nThe town was first mentioned in written documents in 1436. It received Magdeburg rights in 1569, from Polish King Sigismund II Augustus. Jaworów was a royal town of Poland. It was a favorite residence of king John III Sobieski. In 1675 John III signed the Polish-French Treaty of Jaworów in the town, and there he also received the congratulations from the Pope on his success against the Turks at Vienna (1683).\n\nUntil the Partitions of Poland, Jaworów was an important center of commerce, located along main merchant route from Jarosław to Lwów. In 1772 it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In Galicia, it was the seat of a county, with the population of almost 11,000 (Poles, Jews, Ukrainians and Czechs).\n\nIn the immediate post-World War I period, the area of Jaworów witnessed fights of the Polish-Ukrainian War. After the war, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic, where it remained until the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in September 1939. The Jews of the village were merchants or artisans. There was a synagogue. \n\nDuring the invasion of Poland, on September 14–16, 1939, Poles defeated invading Germans in the Battle of Jaworów. Despite the victory, the town soon fell to the Soviets, and was under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941, and then under German occupation until 1944.\n\nThe Jewish population before the German occupation on June 26, 1941 was around 3000. Immediately after the Germans arrived, antisemitic Ukrainians launched a pogrom, robbing and killing Jews.  German forces took 15 Jews to a nearby forest and shot them. After that, for several months, Jews lived in their own homes but were banned on the main street and had a 6 pm curfew.  The Ukrainian police brutalized them, with beatings and some plunder and rape.  Several hundred Jews were sent to local forced labor camps.  In November 1942, German security forces, along with German and Ukrainian police, rounded up 1200 Jews, killed 200 on the spot, and sent the others to the Belzec killing camp where they were immediately murdered. A few days later, German and Ukrainian police hunted Jews in hiding and murdered about 200 at the Jewish cemetery.  After that, the Germans established a Jewish ghetto which housed about 600 Jews.  Soon after, Jews from a few neighboring villages were brought to Yavoriv bringing the ghetto population to 6000.  More than 70 people lived in each of the 80 small houses in the ghetto.  The overcrowding, starvation, and poor sanitary conditions soon led to a typhus epidemic.  After about 500 more able-bodied Jews were sent to a labor camp, on April 16, 1943, the German and Ukrainian police took more than 3500 Jews  to the Porudno forest and murdered them.  More than 2500 Jews were murdered before noon on the 16th, the rest over the next few days.  The Germans and Ukrainians burned the ghetto and searched for those in hiding.  Those found were shot.  A few were transferred to a labor camp in Lwow.  In 1944 the town was re-occupied by the Soviets, and in 1945 it was eventually annexed from Poland by the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission reported that more than 4900 people, most of them Jews, had been killed in Yavoriv, in addition to those sent to Belzec.  Only about 20 of the town's Jews were thought to have survived.\n\nNotable people\nAmong notable people born here are Władysław Langner (General of the Polish Army), Stanisław Nowakowski (president of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association), and mathematician Wawrzyniec Żmurko.\n\nGallery\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns — Sister cities\nYavoriv is twinned with:\n\nSee also\n Battle of Jaworow\n\nReferences\n\n Yavoriv, Ukraine\n Official Website Statistics\n Yavorov Jewish History\n\nCities in Lviv Oblast\nKingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria\nLwów Voivodeship\nShtetls\nCities of district significance in Ukraine\nHolocaust locations in Ukraine", "machine_text": "Yavoriv is a city in western Ukraine, located in the Lviv Oblast.

Upon the death of Falkland's first cousin once removed, John Cary, in 1686, he had left that estate in trust to his great-niece, Elizabeth Willoughby, provided that she would marry Lord Guilford within three years of his death; the inheritance was otherwise to go to the 5th Viscount and his heirs, then to Edward Cary and his heirs. Elizabeth's trustees came to an agreement with Falkland and Edward Cary to allow her to enjoy the estate for life, notwithstanding her failure to marry Lord Guilford, and she afterwards married James Bertie. However, the agreement ended upon the deaths of Edward Cary and Falkland, and Lucius' guardian sued in the Court of Chancery, which found in his favor, to obtain the estate.

Cary was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he met and became close friends with the poet John Milton. In 1632, he became a member of parliament for Newport in Cornwall and later represented the constituency of Great Bedwyn. Cary was a supporter of King Charles I, but he never held a significant position in his government. Cary was also a prolific author and a leading figure in the intellectual movement known as the Caroline Circle. His most famous work is the essay \"Of the Inconstancy of Witches,\" which argued against the persecution of witches. He also wrote \"Epitaph on William Shakespeare\" and \"On the Death of Ben Jonson.\" His philosophical work, \"A Discourse of Inevitable Necessity,\" which defended free will and argued against determinism, was highly influential. Cary was admired by his contemporaries for his intelligence, eloquence, and integrity. He was known for his kindness and generosity, especially towards younger writers and scholars. His untimely death at the Battle of Newbury, at the age of 33, was a great loss to the English literary and political world. Cary's legacy continues to be celebrated today.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Julius Fromm\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Julius Fromm (4 March 1883 – 12 May 1945) was a Polish-German entrepreneur, chemist, and one of the inventors of the rubber condom and who also made several other elastomeric products such as rubber gloves and hot water bottles. Owing to his Jewish heritage, his company and personal property was stolen by the Nazis in aryanization when he left Germany for England in 1939. His legacy was not easily reclaimed by his relatives after the war however.\n\nBiography\nFromm was born in Konin, Poland, which was then part of autonomous Congress Poland within the Russian Empire. His parents were both Polish Jews and when Julius was ten years old his family left for Berlin in search of a better life. There, the family made a living by rolling cigarettes as many Eastern European Jews of Berlin did at the time. Julius's parents died young, so he was forced to take care of himself and his six siblings from the age of fifteen. As mechanization gradually replaced manual production, Fromm started attending evening classes in chemistry.\n\nWith World War I, Germany experienced a rapid liberalization of sexual values and sexually transmitted diseases spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of \"skin\": chemically treated intestine or bladder.  Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to vulcanize the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom.  Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped.  Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920, Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.\nThe company also made baby bottle nipples and rubber gloves by dipping formers into a rubber solution.\n\nNazi period\n\nIn 1938, however, under Nazi rule, the government forced Fromm to sell his factories for 116,000 Reichsmark, a fraction of their real value, to Baroness Elisabeth von Epenstein, Hermann Göring's godmother. The process was known as aryanization, and involved selling or auctioning property of Jews at well below market value to German citizens. In return Epenstein gave two castles, Veldenstein and Mauterndorf, to Göring. A year later he emigrated to London, where he died on 12 May 1945. Fromm's estate, which was worth the equivalent of approximately 30 million Euros, had already been auctioned off on 17 May 1943 for 2,255 Reichsmark, though many items including a grand piano, plates, and his library had already been bought or stolen before.\n\nFromms' factory in Köpenick was almost completely destroyed by Allied Air raids, the remaining machinery was shipped to the Soviet Union, as it lay in the Soviet sector of Berlin. The Friedrichshagen factory continued to produce condoms, especially for the Red Army. \nThe factories would have been returned to Fromm's family according to the Potsdam Agreement, however the company was nationalized by the Communist government.\n\nIn East Germany, Fromms condoms were produced by the Volkseigener Betrieb \"Plastina\", the brand was renamed to \"Mondos\".\n\nIn West Germany, Julius Fromm's son Herbert Fromm was forced to pay 174,000 Marks to Otto Metz-Randa for the rights to the name Fromm. Metz-Randa, Elisabeth von Epenstein's lover, had acquired these rights after the death of Göring's godfather, and managed to transform himself from a profiteer of \"Entjudung\" (de-jewification) to a victim of the National Socialist regime. Herbert Fromm licensed a Bremen company to produce Fromms condoms, which—now called Mapa—produces them to the present day.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \"Fromms\" in Das virtuelle Markenmuseum.

Fromm's innovations in condoms manufacturing made him a pioneer in the field of safe sex. Born in Berlin to a Jewish family, Fromm started his career as a pharmacist's assistant before he established his own business to manufacture rubber goods such as toys, teats, and hot water bottles. In 1912, Fromm received a patent for his invention of the \"Fromm's Act,\" a method of manufacturing seamless rubber condoms. Fromm's Act allowed the production of long, seamless tubes of rubber, which later were cut and shaped into condoms of different sizes. In 1916, Fromm founded the Fromms Actien-Gesellschaft (FAG) company, which became one of the largest condom manufacturers in the world. The company's condoms, marketed under the Oke brand, were popular in Europe and the United States. Fromm was also a pioneer in the development of an effective and inexpensive spermicide. His development of these technologies revolutionized the condom industry and gave consumers greater confidence in using them. During the Nazi regime in Germany, Fromm's company and assets were confiscated, and he was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he died in 1945. His legacy, however, lived on, and he is widely regarded as a trailblazer in the development of safe sex practices. Today, Fromm is remembered for his contributions to public health and his efforts to promote safe sex practices during an era when contraception was not a widely accepted practice. His innovative manufacturing techniques and commitment to using condoms as a means of preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases helped create a safer and healthier world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10022529}

The season started in October 1990 and ended in June 1991. It was contested by 16 teams, including the reigning champions, AS Douanes. The league's defending champions started the season on a slow note, picking up just one win in their first five matches. This opened up an opportunity for their title rivals to catch up, and that's exactly what ASC Diaraf and Stade de Mbour did. Diaraf won six of their first eight matches, while Mbour won five of their first seven matches. In the second half of the season, AS Douanes picked up their form, winning four of their last five matches. They finished the season with 32 points, just one point ahead of ASC Diaraf and two points ahead of Stade de Mbour. The top scorer of the season was Babacar Niang of Diaraf, who scored a total of 14 goals in 25 matches. AS Douanes' triumph was a remarkable one as they were able to win the league title after finishing second in the previous season. The club had previously won the Senegalese Premier League four times before the 1990–91 season. Other noteworthy performances during the season included US Gorée's impressive home record, where they scored 24 goals while conceding just three in nine matches. ASC Port Autonome, on the other hand, had a poor season, finishing in 15th place and getting relegated to Division 2.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pornographic film\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pornographic films (pornos), erotic films, or sex films are films that present sexually explicit subject matter in order to arouse and satisfy the viewer. Pornographic films present sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity (softcore) and sexual intercourse (hardcore). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality, and focuses more on arousal than storytelling; the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional film stock in various formats, home video, DVDs, Internet download, cable TV, in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing adult theaters. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on free-to-air television.\n\nFilms with risqué content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of producers began to specialize in their production. Various groups within society considered such depictions immoral, labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, and could only be distributed by underground channels. Because the viewing of such films carried a social stigma, they were viewed at brothels, adult movie theaters, stag parties, at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nIn the 1970s, during the Golden Age of Porn, pornographic films were semi-legitimized; by the 1980s, pornography on home video achieved wider distribution. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s changed the way pornographic films are distributed, complicating censorship regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\nClassification\n\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either softcore or hardcore pornography. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or extreme fetishism. It generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration. A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.\n\nPornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the sexual fantasy which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the market to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain conventions, and each may appeal to a particular audience.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years: 20th century\n\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eugène Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \"Léar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film  had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.\n\nAlso in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance was released as a short nickelodeon kinetoscope/film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risque films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. Perhaps in defiance and \"to spice up a film\", this was followed by many kiss imitators, including The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) and The Kiss (1900). A tableau vivant style was used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.\n\nIn Austria, cinemas organised men-only theatre nights (called ) at which adult films were shown. Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the Pathé brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find, though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female nudity in film.\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In Black and White and Blue (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's Film Facts, \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is \" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian , whose original title could have been  (The Satyr), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film  (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration.\"\n\n1920s–1940s suppression\nPornographic movies were widespread in the silent movie era of the 1920s, and were often shown in brothels. Soon illegal, stag films, or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.\n\n1950s: home movies \nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the 8 mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, Harrison Marks produced films which were considered risqué, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.\n\n1960s: Europe and United States\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, Lasse Braun was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute hardcore movies which he sold to Reuben Sturman, who distributed them to 60,000 American peep show booths. Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director Doris Wishman began producing a series of eight pornographic films, or nudist films without sex scenes, including Hideout in the Sun (1960), Nude on the Moon (1961) and Diary of a Nudist (1961). She also produced a series of sexploitation films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated sexual intercourse. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid penis. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in Massachusetts allegedly for being pornographic. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene, paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film Language of Love (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex educational film, which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, Denmark became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the Netherlands, also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, child pornography and bestiality porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.\n\nIn the United States, producers of pornographic films formed the Adult Film Association of America in 1969, after the release of Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to fight against censorship, and to defend the industry against obscenity charges.\n\n1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States \nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. Mainstream theatres did normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of adult theaters in the United States and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in sex shops that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as Bordellet (1972), the Bedside-films (1970–1976) and the Zodiac-films (1973–1978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early Bedside-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history and all remain favourites on home video.\n\nIn 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film was a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was made.\n\nThe first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be Mona the Virgin Nymph (also known as Mona), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco, who created the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) 1974 cult film Flesh Gordon and later, in 1976, the X-rated musical-comedy film Alice in Wonderland.\n\nThe 1971 film Boys in the Sand represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, The Boys in the Band), and, after the 1969 film Blue Movie, one of the first to be reviewed by The New York Times. Other notable American hardcore feature films of the 1970s include Deep Throat (1972), Behind the Green Door (1972), The Devil in Miss Jones (1973), Radley Metzger's The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976) and Debbie Does Dallas (1978). These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. William Rotsler expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision. Nothing can stop this.\" In Britain, Deep Throat was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.\n\nThe U.S. was Miller v. California was an important court case in 1973. The case established that obscenity was not legally protected, but the case also established the Miller test, a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to indecency (which may or may not be legal).\n\n1980s: new technology and new legal cases\nWith the arrival of the home video cassette recorder in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like Traci Lords, Seka, Christy Canyon, Ginger Lynn, Nina Hartley, and directors such as Gregory Dark. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. Those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This marked the end of the age of big-budget productions, and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos. One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the camcorder spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe de facto result of the 1987 legal case California v. Freeman effectively legalized hardcore pornography in the U.S.. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.\n\n1990s: DVD and the Internet age\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format (videotape) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos were ordered from an adult bookstore or through mail-order; with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including paysites, video hosting services and peer-to-peer file sharing. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991, as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time, led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\nViv Thomas, Paul Thomas, Andrew Blake, Antonio Adamo, and Rocco Siffredi were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the Danish, Oscar-nominated film production company Zentropa became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce hardcore pornographic films, starting with Constance (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced Idioterne (1998), directed by Lars von Trier, which won many international awards and was nominated for a Golden Palm in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). Idioterne started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance, which starred pornstar Rocco Siffredi.\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel Kanal København started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the Copenhagen area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of Innocent Pictures, a company started by Zentropa).\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. The Internet served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. The market was further expanded by webcams and webcam recordings, in which thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n2000s: competition and contraction\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size. At the same time this gave rise to video sharing platforms such as Pornhub, YouPorn and XHamster.\n\nPornographic film industry\n\nEconomics\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion which includes the production of various media and associated products and services. The industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. According to a 2005 Reuters article, \"The multi-billion-dollar industry releases about 11,000 titles on DVD each year.\" Pornographic films can be sold or rented out on DVD, shown through Internet and special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite, and in adult theaters. However, by 2012, widespread availability of illegally copied content and other low-cost competition on the Internet had made the pornographic film industry smaller and reduced profitability.\n\nThe global pornographic film industry is dominated by the United States, with the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles being the heart of the industry.\n\nIn 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the United States was estimated at $5–10 million. The 1979, Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that \"in Los Angeles alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume.\" According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.\n\n the total current income of the country's adult entertainment is often estimated at $10–13 billion, of which $4–6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998. In 2007 The Observer newspaper also gave a figure of $13 billion. Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, websites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6–3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). USA Today claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni's Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time. The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3 billion but the figure obtaining is unclear. According to the 2001 Forbes data, the annual income distribution is the following:\n\nThe Online Journalism Review, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored Forbes number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate—hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.\n\nThe world's largest adult movie studio Vivid Entertainment generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually, and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. The Spanish-based studio Private Media Group was listed on the NASDAQ until November 2011. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to a half-billion by 1993. Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation's DirecTV. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.\n\nProduction\n\nPornographic films are produced and directed at the target audience, who buy and view the films. Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the sexualization of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of feminist pornography.\"'Artisanal, locally grown, free range porn for women\" Nagy, Toni. Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013 In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of physical attractiveness.\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\nLegal status\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid. Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of People v. Freeman. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely portraying a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.But see news.com.au: Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows February 08, 2010\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\" The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\nAn offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines. Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States is personal possession in the home (Stanley v. Georgia).\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in Miller v. California that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the Muslim world and China, but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n Health issues \nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of condoms, with an accompanying risk of sexually transmitted disease among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of HIV infection which led to the deaths through AIDS of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation, which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days. , HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades. The AIM closed its doors in May 2011 and filed for bankruptcy as a result of a court case arising from an inadvertent leak by it of confidential information on clients, including names and STD results.\n\nTerminology\n\n Compilation – a release based on highlights from other adult films or video, unused footage, or that feature a particular genre\n Mature – used to refer to performers in or of the genre referred to as MILF porn\n Raincoat – a term used to refer to a condom\n Other terms synonymous with pornography:\nPorn or porno\nAdult film\nBlue movie\nStag film\nSkin flick\n\nSee also\n\n List of pornographic film awards\n Adult theater\n Amateur pornography\n Cartoon pornography\n Cum shot\n List of pornographic film studios\n Pornography addiction \n Porn groove\n Porn parody\n Pornography by region\n STDs in the porn industry\n Unsimulated sex\n X-rated\n\nReferencesNotesBibliography'''\n Patrick Robertson: Film Facts'', 2001, Billboard Books,\n\nExternal links\n \n\n Films\n \nFilm genres", "machine_text": "Pornographic film A pornographic film or adult film is a type of film that features explicit sexual content and focuses on sexual activity of individuals. Pornographic films are usually designed for adults and meant for private consumption, but they have been widely distributed to the public through the internet and other means of dissemination. History The production of pornographic films can trace back to the 19th century. The first pornographic films were silent black-and-white shorts that were shown in adult theaters or \"smut houses\" in major cities. Later, in the 1960s and 70s, the widespread availability of 8 mm film and Super 8 cameras allowed the production of homemade pornographic films. The pornographic film industry started to emerge during the 1970s, known as the \"Golden Age of Porn\". This era saw the emergence of a new group of pornographic actors and directors who created innovative and artistic pornographic films. Current state The availability of the internet has revolutionized the way pornographic films are produced and consumed. It has made it easier and cheaper for amateur producers to enter the industry and distribute their films online. In some countries, the production and distribution of pornographic films are illegal, while in others, they are legal but regulated. The pornographic industry generates billions of dollars in revenue worldwide, with the United States and Japan being the biggest markets. Criticism and controversy The production and consumption of pornographic films have been subject to criticism and controversy. Critics argue that the industry is exploitative and objectifies women, contributing to the sexualization and objectification of women in society. Some studies have found a link between exposure to pornography and negative outcomes such as sexual dysfunction, addiction, and harm to relationships. However, other studies have disputed these findings, arguing that pornography is not harmful in moderation. Conclusion Pornographic films remain a controversial and popular form of adult entertainment. The industry faces challenges from changing consumer behaviors, technological disruption, and regulation. Despite criticism, it is likely that pornographic films will continue to be produced and consumed as long as there is a market for them.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 238253}

He was president of the Alaska Senate, leading a caucus of 14 Republicans and 1 Democrat from 2015 to 2017. Meyer served in the Alaska Legislature continuously from 2003 to 2018, in both the Alaska House of Representatives and Senate, previously representing the district when it was District O. He works as an investment recovery coordinator for ConocoPhillips.\n\nOn December 29, 2021, Meyer announced that he would not be seeking a second term.\n\nEducation\nMeyer earned his BS in business administration from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, his MPA  from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and his MBA from Alaska Pacific University.\n\nElections\n2000: Challenging incumbent Republican Representative Jerry Sanders for the District 19 seat, Meyer won the August 22, 2000 primary with 706 votes (54.94%) and won the November 7, 2000 General election with 4,502 votes (64.67%) against Democratic nominee Patti Higgins, who had previously run for the seat in 1996 and 1998.\n2002: Meyer was unopposed for the August 27, 2002 Republican primary, winning with 1,664 votes, and was unopposed for the November 5, 2002 General election, winning with 4,891 votes (96.41%) against write-in candidates.\n2004: Meyer was unopposed for the August 24, 2004 Republican primary, winning with 1,664 votes, and won the November 2, 2004 General election with 5,407 votes (70.96%), against Democratic nominee Rachael Higgins.\n2006: Meyer was unopposed for the August 22, 2006 Republican primary, winning with 2,530 votes, and was unopposed for the November 7, 2006 General election with 4,893 votes (94.55%), against write-in candidates.\n2008: When Republican Senator John Cowdery retired and left the District O seat open, Meyer was unopposed for the August 26, 2008 Republican Primary, winning with 4,515 votes, Meyer won the November 4, 2008 General election with 9,874 votes (68.88%) against Democratic nominee Doug Van Etten.\n2012: With Democratic Senator Johnny Ellis redistricted to District I, Meyer was unopposed for the District L August 28, 2012 Republican Primary winning with 3,110 votes, and won the November 6, 2012 General election with 10,304 votes (72.41%) against Democratic nominee Jake Hale.\n\nControversies\nIn 2013, Meyer voted with the Alaska Senate Majority to pass Senate Bill 21, restructuring the state of Alaska's tax code for oil companies and reducing their tax burden. This vote benefited Meyer's full-time employer, ConocoPhillips. (Membership in the Alaska state legislature is not a full-time position, and Meyer, like many of his fellow members, maintain full-time employment elsewhere, taking leave when the legislature is in session.) When the bill came to the Senate floor, Meyer asked to be recused from voting. Under legislative rules, however, a member of the legislature must vote if any other members object, and several did.\n\nIn 2015, Meyer announced he had offered a contract for communications consulting to McHugh Pierre.  Pierre formerly served as the civilian second in command for the Alaska State Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, but was forced to resign in 2014 after investigation revealed he had exerted inappropriate and undue influence to derail an investigation of a high school friend of his then serving in the National Guard and suspected of sexually assaulting another member of the Alaska National Guard.  Investigation also revealed Pierre attempted to coerce whistle-blowers into signing non-disclosure agreements prohibiting them from speaking to the media or outsiders about ongoing problems with multiple sexual assaults and other misconduct in the Alaska National Guard.  Meyer described the allegations against Pierre, including those contained in the report prepared by the National Guard Bureau's Office of Complex Investigations as \"hearsay.\"\n\nIn 2020, Meyer decided to mail absentee ballot applications to voters 65 and older, but not to younger voters. The Disability Law Center of Alaska and other plaintiffs are suing Lieutenant Governor Meyer and the State of Alaska on the grounds that this constitutes unconstitutional discrimination. The plaintiffs want absentee ballot applications mailed to all voters.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n Kevin Meyer at 100 Years of Alaska's Legislature\n\n|-\n\n1956 births\n21st-century American politicians\nAlaska Pacific University alumni\nAlaska Republicans\nAlaska state senators\nAnchorage Assembly members\nLieutenant Governors of Alaska\nLiving people\nMembers of the Alaska House of Representatives\nPeople from Beatrice, Nebraska\nPresidents of the Alaska Senate\nUniversity of Nebraska–Lincoln alumni\nUniversity of New Mexico alumni", "machine_text": "Kevin Meyer is an American politician who served as the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Alaska from 2014 to 2018.

The album is an intimate portrayal of Bay's personal life, combining his signature soulful sound with raw emotion and vulnerability. The album was positively received by critics.

The fossils of Pseudothurmannia were first discovered in the Hunsrück Mountains of Germany in the early 20th century. It is a member of the Order Phyllocarida, a group of small, shrimp-like crustaceans with flattened bodies that lived in shallow marine environments. The body of Pseudothurmannia is divided into three distinct regions: the cephalon, or head, the thorax, and the pygidium, or tail. The head has five segments, some of which are fused, and the thorax consists of eight segments, each bearing a pair of biramous limbs. The pygidium has five segments, and ends with a long spine, similar to the tail of a lobster. Despite its somewhat shrimp-like appearance, Pseudothurmannia did not have a carapace, or hard outer covering, like modern-day shrimp. Instead, its body was protected by a series of overlapping plates, or sclerites, which were shed and replaced as the animal grew. The genus Pseudothurmannia is currently considered to contain only one species, Pseudothurmannia noetlingi. Fossils of this species have been found in Germany, as well as in Morocco, Belgium, and the Czech Republic. Pseudothurmannia is an important fossil genus for researchers studying the evolution of arthropods, as it represents an early example of the phyllocarid body plan. Additionally, the fossils of Pseudothurmannia provide valuable information about the ancient marine ecosystems in which they lived. In summary, Pseudothurmannia is an extinct genus of small, shrimp-like crustaceans that lived during the Early Devonian period. It is important to the scientific community for its representation of an early example of the phyllocarid body plan and its usefulness in studying ancient marine ecosystems.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42947701}

He won the European Cup with Celtic in 1967 along with several domestic honours. His other clubs included Stenhousemuir, Raith Rovers, Heart of Midlothian and Dumbarton in the Scottish leagues, and Crystal Palace in English football.\n\nWallace played for Scotland seven times and was inducted into the national Hall of Fame in 2017 for his club achievements.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\nHe started his senior playing career with Stenhousemuir as a teenager in 1958 (having played alongside Jim Storrie at Kilsyth Rangers), moving to Raith Rovers a year later. It was in Kirkcaldy that \"Wispy\", as Wallace was nicknamed, developed his reputation as a top-class goal poacher, his skills being rewarded with a first Scottish League cap.\n\nHearts\nWallace's form attracted attention from larger clubs, Heart of Midlothian eventually spending £15,000 to take him to Edinburgh in April 1961. The increased pressure for success at Tynecastle initially curtailed his scoring exploits, for he was expected to replace no less a figure than Alex Young, the \"Golden Vision\", whom Hearts had sold to Everton a couple of months earlier. By season 1962–63, however, Wallace was fully settled into the tactics of manager Tommy Walker, and he would become Hearts' top scorer for the next four seasons through to 1965–66. In doing so, he helped Hearts win the Scottish League Cup in 1962 and come within a goal of winning the 1964–65 Scottish Football League title, while gaining full international recognition for Scotland.\n\nIn 1966, however, his form plummeted and his goalscoring ceased and, amid rumours that he had been \"tapped\" up by another club, his departure from Tynecastle was widely anticipated. The surprise was that his destination wasn't boyhood favourites Rangers but their nemesis Celtic, for whom Jock Stein paid £30,000 to secure his services. He played a total of 248 matches for Hearts in all competitions, scoring 131 goals.\n\nCeltic\nWithin six months of joining Celtic, Wallace was to attain Scottish footballing immortality, as one of the \"Lisbon Lions\", the famous team who won the European Cup in 1967. He was later part of the team that reached the 1970 European Cup Final but was defeated 2–1 by Feyenoord. He also won the league championship in each of the four seasons he was at the Glasgow club, plus the Scottish Cup in 1967, 1969 and 1971 and the League Cup in 1968 and 1968 during an era widely considered the greatest in the club's history. In total, he scored 140 goals for Celtic in 239 games.\n\nLater career\nAfter five fruitful years with Celtic, Wallace and team-mate John Hughes were sold to Crystal Palace in October 1971 for a combined fee of £30,000. Neither enjoyed great success in Croydon and Wallace was back in Scotland with Dumbarton less than a year later. As his career wound down, he moved to Australia in March 1975 to play for APIA, where he won two league titles before returning to Scotland in March 1977, first to Partick Thistle for a week, before becoming player-coach at Ross County for the rest of the 1976–77 season.\n\nInternational career\nIn total, Wallace was capped seven times for Scotland and four times for the Scottish Football League XI. He was part of the Scotland team that defeated England at Wembley in 1967.\n\nCareer after retirement\nRetiring as a player in June 1977, he joined the coaching staff at Dundee. When this role ended he returned to APIA as a coach, eventually settling in Sydney and starting his own sports shop.\n\nIn 2008, Tommy Burns, a former Celtic player and manager, died; Wallace helped organise a tribute match played on 31 May 2009 at Celtic Park, attended by over 35,000 people. The Celtic squad of the time defeated the 'Tommy Burns Select' team 11–4. In July of the same year, Wallace arranged a friendly match in Australia (where he had lived for the past 30 years) between Celtic and the local professional club Brisbane Roar; Celtic won 3–0.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nInternational appearances\n\nSee also\nList of footballers in Scotland by number of league appearances (500+)\nList of footballers in Scotland by number of league goals (200+)\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n\n1940 births\nAPIA Leichhardt FC players\nAssociation football inside forwards\nCeltic F.C. players\nCrystal Palace F.C. players\nDumbarton F.C. players\nDundee F.C. non-playing staff\nExpatriate soccer players in Australia\nHeart of Midlothian F.C. players\nKilsyth Rangers F.C. players\nLiving people\nPartick Thistle F.C. players\nRaith Rovers F.C. players\nRoss County F.C. players\nScotland international footballers\nScottish expatriate footballers\nScottish Football League players\nScottish Football League representative players\nScottish footballers\nSportspeople from Kirkintilloch\nStenhousemuir F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nScottish Football Hall of Fame inductees\nUEFA Champions League winning players\nScottish expatriate sportspeople in Australia\nHighland Football League players\nScottish Junior Football Association players\nOutfield association footballers who played in goal\nScottish emigrants to Australia", "machine_text": "Willie Wallace was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a striker between 1961 and 1976.

Pinafore (1878) and Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance (1880).\n\nHe later became a noted voice teacher and continued to perform, mostly at society events. On the death of his elder brother, in 1903, he became the seventh baronet of Kilfane.\n\nEarly years\nPower was born in Kilkenny, the fourth son of Sir John Power of Kilfane, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, née Wade, from Clonabrany, County Meath. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin, and studied voice in Milan and Florence from 1873 to 1876, with Achille Graffigna and Francesco Lamperti, among others.\n\nIn 1876, Power first appeared on stage at the Teatro Manoel in Valletta, Malta, singing Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville.  He made his London stage debut in December 1877 at Her Majesty's Theatre playing the tenor role in Thomas Haynes Bayly's English version of Adolphe Adam's opera The Swiss Cottage. This proved to be Power's only appearance in serious opera.\n\nPower joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy-Opera Company in February 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, succeeding George Bentham in the leading tenor role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Sorcerer. From March to April 1878 Power also played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that companion piece was added to the bill at the Opera Comique. He created the role of Ralph Rackstraw in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, H.M.S. Pinafore, \"one of the most successful pieces of musical theatre of the Victorian era\" playing the character from May 1878 to February 1880. The Daily News wrote that Power \"displayed a light tenor voice of very agreeable quality, and acted the part of the sentimental lover well\", although The Times found his intonation \"a little uncertain\".\n\nWhen The Pirates of Penzance premiered in London, Power originated the role of Frederic in that opera. Power received warm reviews for this role from the London press. The Times said that his \"sympathetic tenor voice was heard to great advantage in the sentimental music\", and The Standard wrote that he \"acts ... just in that simple-minded way that brings out most strongly the absurdity of the character, and he sings exceedingly well.\" A critic from The New York Times, however, commented: \"Temple has been a member of the Gilbert-Sullivan company from the first.  Mr George Power has not: and his \"thin\" style is a material drawback. As an actor, he is weak, as a man he is not interesting, as a tenor he is small. Once or twice he sang sweetly, and he was always in tune.  As a concert singer he would probably be very successful in sentimental ballads; as Frederic he is unsatisfactory.\" The Era agreed with the majority: \"a very agreeable light tenor voice and a pleasing style, qualities which have already gained for him no little favour in the previous opera … [he has] good taste vocally and a fair amount of histrionic skill.\"\n\nDuring the run of Pirates, Power took part in some Sunday matinée performances of new operettas along with D'Oyly Carte colleague Rutland Barrington, and on one occasion acted in a non-musical play, L'Aventurière, given in the original French by a cast headed by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Power played Frederic until October 1880, when he left the D'Oyly Carte company.\n\nLater years\n\nOver the following months, Power performed mostly in society concerts. In May 1881, he appeared in the operetta Incognito, by Henri Logé, and in July 1881, Power played Lieut. de Blanc-Mange in a short operetta, Out of Sight, by Frederick Clay and B. C. Stephenson. In August 1881, he created the role of Charles Lorrimore in the Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens comic opera Claude Duval, at the Olympic Theatre, opposite Marion Hood, who had been his partner in The Pirates of Penzance. The production ran for only 54 performances, and Power left the production three days before it closed in October.\n\nPower then became a teacher of singing, continuing to make occasional appearances on the stage until he end of the century, mostly in concert and society events, and with Percy North's Operetta Company. In 1885 he played Colonel Sylvester at Hove in a new operetta, When One Door Shuts Another Opens by Harriet Young and Charles Thomas. His students included the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing.\n\nWhen his elder brother Sir Adam Clayton Power (1844–1903) died, Power succeeded to his family's baronetcy as the seventh baronet of Kilfane. Together with Jessie Bond, Leonora Braham and Julia Gwynne, he was one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside Arthur Sullivan Memorial in the Victoria Embankment Gardens.\n\nOn 2 September 1915, by then in his late 60s, Power married Eva Gertrude Boulton (1864–1952), the daughter of family friend Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton and Sophia Louisa Cooper. There were no children, and the Power baronetcy ended on his death in 1928.\n\nPower died in Kensington, London, aged 81, and is buried in the Boulton Family Vault in Brookwood Cemetery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPower interviewed in The Era, 18 July 1908, p. 15\n \n\n1846 births\n1928 deaths\nPeople educated at Cheltenham College\nAlumni of Trinity College Dublin\n19th-century British male opera singers\nBaronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom\n19th-century Irish male opera singers", "machine_text": "Sir George Power, 7th Baronet, was a British landowner and politician who lived from 1787 to 1859.

It is situated in the far northeastern corner of Ontonagon County and is bordered by Houghton County to the east and Keweenaw County to the north. According to the 2010 census, the population of Greenland Township was 221. The township was named after Greenland, a Danish territory in the North Atlantic. The first European settlers in the area were Finnish immigrants who came to work in the logging industry in the late 1800s. Greenland Township was officially organized in 1894 and saw its peak population in the 1920s, with a thriving farming community and numerous small businesses. Today, Greenland Township is primarily a residential community with some small farms and seasonal cottages. It is known for its scenic beauty, with rolling hills, dense forests, and numerous lakes and streams. The township is also home to the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, which offers over 60,000 acres of wilderness area and hiking trails. Greenland Township is governed by a township board consisting of five elected officials, including a supervisor, clerk, treasurer, and two trustees. The township has a volunteer fire department and contracts with neighboring municipalities for police protection and other services. Overall, Greenland Township is a small but vibrant community that offers a high quality of life for its residents.

Turning to the stage, he, after slight training in the country, made his London début in the name of Forrester at the Strand Theatre, under his father's management, on 6 September 1849. On 5 March 1850 he was the original Moses in Sterling Coyne's version of 'The Vicar of Wakefield.' Later in the year he accompanied his father to the new Olympic, and acted under the name of William Farren, jun. In January 1852 he appeared as Cassio to his brother Henry's Othello, and was credited with promise.\n \nOn 28 March 1853, he made his first appearance at the Haymarket, under Buckstone, as Captain Absolute, and was identified with the fortunes of that house either in juvenile tragedy or light comedy until 1867. \nHis more interesting roles were Guibert in Browning's 'Colombo's Birthday' (25 April 1853), the leading part in Bayle Bernard's new play, 'A Life's Trial,' in March 1857, Mercury in Burnand's farcical comedy, 'Venus and Adonis' (28 March 1864), and Romeo on 31 August 1867, in October 1869 he was engaged by Mrs. John Wood for the St. James's, where he appeared as Brizard in Daly's version of 'Frou Frou' (25 May 1870), and Arthur Minton in 'Two Thorns' (4 March 1871), in which he struck the critic Dutton Cook as happily combining  \nOn 9 September 1871, Farren migrated to the Vaudeville, with which he was long associated. There he was the original Sir Geoffrey Champneys in H. J. Byron's comedy 'Our Boys' on 16 January 1875, and played the part, without intermission, until July 1878. \nSubsequently, he was seen at the Royal Aquarium (afterwards Imperial Theatre) as Grandfather Whitehead (9 November 1878), in which he was deemed inferior in pathos to his father; as young Marlow; as Archer in 'The Beaux' Stratagem' (Oct. 1879); as Sir Robert Bramble in 'The Poor Gentleman'; and as Adam in Miss Litton's revival of 'As You Like It' — a role which he repeated later at the opening of the Shaftesbury Theatre (20 October 1888). Returning to the Vaudeville, he was Seth Pecksniff in 'Tom Pinch' (10 March 1881) and Sir Peter Teazle in the elaborate revival of 'The School for Scandal' (4 Feb. 1882). \nThat part he resumed at the Criterion in April 1891 and at the Lyceum in June 1896. On 9 Dec. 1882 he challenged further comparison with his father by playing Sir Anthony Absolute. Subsequent parts included Colonel Damas at the Lyceum to the Pauline Deschappelles of Miss Mary Anderson (27 October 1883).\n \nIn 1887, in conjunction with H. B. Conway, Farren started the Conway-Farren old comedy company at the Strand, appearing there as Lord Ogleby in 'The Clandestine Marriage,' old Domton, and other characters. \nAt the Criterion on 27 November 1890, he played with great acceptance his father's original part of Sir Harcourt Courtly in 'London Assurance.' \nAfter 1896, his appearances on the stage were confined to occasional performances of Simon Ingot in 'David Garrick' with (Sir) Charles Wyndham. \nOn his retirement in 1898, he settled at Rome. \nHe died at Siena on 25 September 1908, and was buried there.\n\nAssessment\nFarren, like his father, ripened slowly. It was not until middle age, when juvenile roles were abandoned, that he gradually established himself in public favour. One of the last of the traditional representatives of the Sir Anthony Absolutes and Mr. Hardcastles of classic English comedy, he achieved in Sir Peter Teazle, according to the critics of 1896, 'a masterpiece of sheer virtuosity,' but he lacked his father's powers, and his gifts of humorous expression were confined to the dry and caustic.\n\nFamily\nIn 1846, Farren married Josephine Elizabeth Davies, who was not connected with the stage, and by her had as surviving issue a daughter, who lived privately, and a son, Percy, an actor, known while his father was on the stage (from 1882) as William Farren, junior, and subsequently as William Farren. In 1908 Percy Farren, under the name William Farren, appeared in Alfred Sutro's play The Builder of Bridges at St James's Theatre. He made his first London appearance in 1880 and made several acting tours in the USA.\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n\nSources\n \n http://www.emich.edu/public/english/adelphi_calendar/perfactr.htm\n http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp89050\n\n1825 births\n1908 deaths\nEnglish male stage actors\nMale actors from London\n19th-century English male actors\n19th-century English singers", "machine_text": "William Farren Jr. (1836-1908) was an American entrepreneur and philanthropist known for his pioneering work in the manufacturing industry and his generous contributions to education and social welfare.

Actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised their roles as Del Boy and Rodney in the sketch written by Jim Sullivan and Dan Sullivan; the script included previously unused material written by their father John Sullivan, who created and wrote every episode of the series. David Beckham guest starred,  Beckham having got in touch with Jim Sullivan.\n\nAccording to Shazam Productions there was a lot of interest in the sketch. The return of Only Fools and Horses was eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981 until 2003.\n\nThis special sketch was dedicated to the memory of John Sullivan and Roger Lloyd-Pack, who had both died prior to its broadcast.\n\nSynopsis \nAn unspecified amount of time after the series' last regular episode \"Sleepless in Peckham,\" Del Boy is in Peckham market, trying to sell \"Golden Balls\" underpants which are supposedly endorsed and signed by David Beckham (in return for Del Boy securing a bouncy castle for the birthday party of one of Beckham's son's, Brooklyn, who Del incorrectly calls Brookside), with Rodney serving as a less-than-enthusiastic model. After failing to sell anything, the Trotters retreat to a nearby cafe, where Rodney complains about Del's treatment of him. Del apologises, mentioning several incidents where he had mistreated Rodney. (These being incidents from previous regular Only Fools and Horses episodes.) Sharing the table with the two is David Beckham, who it turns out actually has endorsed the underpants. The three briefly chat, including Rodney and Beckham discussing their favourite artist (Rodney choosing Matisse, and Beckham choosing Tony Hart), before Beckham gives Rodney tips on how to model underwear effectively, advising him to \"glide\" and \"oscillate.\"\n\nLater on, Del is again trying to sell the underpants, with Rodney putting on a bizarre, vaguely feminine walk, and being even more angry at Del than he was before, telling him \"Derek, I'm going to kill you\". Beckham is discreetly watching this, when a young boy walks up to him, and asks him if he's David Beckham. He says that he is, and signs the boy's football, but says not to tell anyone he is there, as he does not want to draw anymore attention to himself. Beckham then attempts to lean back on a goods cart, but a trader moves it away while he isn't looking and he falls to the ground (referencing a famous moment in the episode \"Yuppy Love\"), getting the attention of everyone in the market. Del and Rodney comment, \"What a plonker!\"\n\nCast\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Sport Relief TV revealed\n Only Fools and Horses sketch to appear on Sport Relief\n Sport Relief 2014: David Beckham in Only Fools and Horses\n Only Fools and Horses to return with new sketch for Sport Relief\n\n2014 British television episodes\n2014 in British sport\nOnly Fools and Horses special episodes\nSport Relief", "machine_text": "Beckham in Peckham is a term used to describe the phenomenon of wealthy individuals or celebrities visiting or investing in the diverse and historically working-class area of Peckham, located in the southeast part of London. One of the most famous examples of a celebrity being associated with Peckham is former footballer David Beckham. In 2018, Beckham opened a new luxury men’s grooming salon in Peckham, called the “House 99”. The salon quickly became a popular spot among the locals and visitors looking for a new hairstyle or a beard trim. Beckham himself is known for his sharp and often adventurous looks, and his salon, which features a curated selection of grooming products and barber services, seems to reflect his own fashion sense. However, Beckham’s interest in Peckham does not seem to be solely business-related. In fact, he was seen attending a match of the local football team, Dulwich Hamlet FC, in 2019, and reportedly also visited a community project in the area. This demonstrates his commitment to supporting and engaging with the local community of Peckham. While the presence of wealthy celebrities in Peckham may bring attention and investment to the area, it is also important to acknowledge the potential negative effects of gentrification. There have been concerns that the influx of trendy businesses and upscale developments could displace long-time residents and lead to rising housing prices. Additionally, some critics argue that the celebrity fascination with Peckham perpetuates stereotypes about working-class areas being “cool” and “edgy”, rather than addressing the socio-economic issues that may exist in the area. Overall, while Beckham’s involvement with Peckham may have positive impacts on both the local economy and community, it is important to approach the topic with a critical and nuanced perspective.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42073739}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pennine Way\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for  from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the \"backbone of England\". Although not the United Kingdom's longest National Trail (this distinction belongs to the  South West Coast Path), it is according to The Ramblers \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States of America, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the Daily Herald in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman's Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately  section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.\n\nThe Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series The Pennine Way was broadcast throughout April.\n\nUsage\n\nThe Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed £2 million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.\n\nAccommodation is available at Youth Hostels, camp sites, B&Bs and pubs but are limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.\n\nThere are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.\n\nMost of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.\n\nRoute\n\nA survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges.  of the route is on public footpaths,  on public bridleways and  on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.\n\nPeak District National Park\n\nThe Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail  away.\n\nFrom Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.\n\nSouth Pennines\n\nFrom Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire–Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about  west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.\n\nThe trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.\n\nFrom Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.\n\nYorkshire Dales National Park\n\nNorth of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle–Carlisle Railway).\n\nThe Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle–Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.\n\nThe path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the  ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.\n\nFrom Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.\n\nNorth Pennines\n\nAt Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God's Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.\n\nFrom Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Nick, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.\n\nFrom Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at  the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.\n\nThe trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.\n\nNorthumberland National Park and the Scottish border\n\nOutside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian's Wall. For the next  the route coincides with the Hadrian's Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap,  west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.\n\nFrom the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.\n\nThe last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is  long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.\n\nRecords\nThe record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15–17 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).\n\nThe fastest women's time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14–17 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12–15 September 2020.\n\nThe route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.\n\nFurther reading \n\nThe Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to £15,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.\nBarry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.\n\nImage gallery\n\nSee also\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPennine Way Official Site\nPennine Way Association\nPractical information for the walk\nMap of the Pennine Way in  segments\nPennine Way Companion Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\nThe Pennine Way Pint Related article published on Alfred Wainwright Books & Memorabilia\n\nLong-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom\nFootpaths in Northumberland\nFootpaths in the Scottish Borders\nFootpaths in West Yorkshire\nFootpaths in North Yorkshire\nFootpaths in Cumbria\nTourist attractions in County Durham\nPennines\nFootpaths in Derbyshire\nFootpaths in Yorkshire", "machine_text": "Pennine Way Pennine Way is a long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom that runs from the Peak District in the heart of England to the Scottish borders near Kirk Yetholm. It is considered one of the most challenging and iconic National Trails in Britain, spanning a distance of 268 miles (431 km) through some of the country's most beautiful and scenic landscapes. The Pennine Way was officially opened on April 24, 1965, by Tom Stephenson, who devised the route and campaigned tirelessly to create the path. The route was created as a way of allowing walkers to explore the majesty of the Pennines, the upland region that runs along the backbone of England. Its popularity and fame quickly spread, and it became known worldwide as a must-do hike for outdoor enthusiasts. The route passes through three National Parks – the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, and Northumberland – and other areas of outstanding natural beauty such as the Upper Teesdale, the Cheviot Hills, and the Malham Cove limestone pavement. It offers walkers a unique opportunity to experience a range of landscapes from gentle rolling hills to wild, rugged terrain. The terrain and weather on the Pennine Way can be challenging, with steep ascents, boggy ground, and high winds. The route passes over several of the highest peaks in England, including Cross Fell and Pen-y-ghent, and also takes in the awe-inspiring landscapes of remote upland moors, deep valleys, and cascading waterfalls. The route can be undertaken in its entirety, taking approximately 18 to 20 days, or walkers can choose to tackle individual sections of the trail. There are a variety of accommodation options available along the path, from campsites and bunkhouses to hotels and bed and breakfasts. It is advisable to plan ahead and book accommodation in advance, particularly in peak season. The Pennine Way is managed by the National Trails, and there are many resources available for planning a trip, including guidebooks, maps, and online resources. The route is well signposted, but walkers should be prepared with appropriate equipment, food, and water, as well as a good level of fitness and experience. The Pennine Way is a challenging and rewarding trail that offers walkers the opportunity to explore the stunning landscapes of northern England. It provides a unique insight into the character and culture of the people who live and work in one of the most beautiful and rugged regions of Britain. For those who complete the route, the Pennine Way is a journey that will be treasured forever.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 319178}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Electricity provider switching\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Electricity provider switching is the ability of power consumers to have an option to choose their electricity provider in a deregulated electricity market as permitted by a state public utilities governing body.\n\nAustralia\nThe Australian market has been somewhat deregulated, but still sees consumers provided with a narrow band of choices.\n\nCanada\nElectricity is deregulated in two Canadian provinces: Ontario and Alberta. Both markets showed price spikes in the first year of deregulation, but then settled down into a volatile but reasonably stable environment. Alberta's market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such reacts more closely to the price of natural gas. Ontario's generation mix is about 50% nuclear.\n\nOntario\nThe consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from one of the deregulated suppliers.   There is a large range of contract options from a variable price to 1,3 or 5 year fixed prices.   Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.   However, as of January 2010 there is a maximum termination penalty allowed.\n\nA very important element in switching electricity providers in Ontario is understanding the Global Adjustment.  This is an adjustment for some commitments government agencies have made on your behalf. It is included in the LDC Regulated Price Plan, but is an additional line item if a contract is signed.\n\nAlberta\nThe consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from a deregulated suppliers. There are however many fewer of these in Alberta. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.\n\nThere is a price comparison service operation in Canada.\n\nFrance \nIn France, electricity market is totally deregulated and consumers have the choice between the historical formerly state-owned provider EDF and several new private providers like Direct Énergie.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nElectricity supply has also been deregulated in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnited States\nIn deregulated markets such as Texas and Maryland, the state government may require the incumbent utility energy provider to allow for unlimited competition within the marketplace, where the consumer is free to choose any electricity provider. Electricity provider switching is only practical if a customer is either buying from a utility or is at the end of a fixed-price contract with a provider.\n\nCertain U.S. states allow for consumer choice in electricity providers, with Texas being the most-widely watched deregulatory scheme.  Many other states are surveying the Texas deregulatory model in order to use its design as a model for the imposition of free market forces within such other power markets.\n\nAs of 2019, 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have \"either full or partial retail choice.\" Along with aforementioned Maryland and Texas, electricity deregulation is current in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Seven additional U.S. states began the process of electricity deregulation but have suspended efforts: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nIn 2019, Arizona's regulatory agency (Arizona Corporation Commission) considered implementing retail electricity deregulation. The proposal was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), an electric utility that provides electricity to 2.7 million people. APS said it was opposed because the change would \"not be in the best interest of customers\" because it would create issues surrounding reliability, \"conflicts . . . with existing law,\" and clean energy implementation difficulties.\n\nA broad and diverse group of retail energy suppliers who share the common vision that competitive retail energy markets deliver a more efficient, customer-oriented outcome than a regulated utility structure. \n\nRetailers Include:\nAEP Energy\n, APG&E Energy Solutions\n, Calpine Energy Solutions\n, Constellations NewEnergy, INC\n, Crius Energy\n, Direct Energy Services LLC\n, Dynegy\n, ENGIE Resources\n, Entrust Energy\n, IGS Energy\n, Just Energy\n, Liberty Power \n, Next Era Energy Services\n, Nordic Energy Services, LLC\n, NRG Energy INC\n, Source Energy \n, Spark Energy\n, Starion Energy\n, Stream Energy\n, Talen Energy\n, TransCanada Power Marketing LTD.\n\nSee also \nCommunity Choice Aggregation\nDeregulation\nDeregulation of the Texas electricity market\nElectricity market\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nA Misguided Criticism of Texas Electricity Deregulation, by Lynne Kiesling\n\nElectric power distribution", "machine_text": "Electricity provider switching refers to the process of cancelling services from one electricity provider and signing up for services with a new provider in order to obtain better rates, terms, and services. It is also known as “retail energy market competition” and it is the means through which electricity providers compete for customers to maintain and increase market share. Electricity provider switching is becoming increasingly popular due to numerous benefits associated with it. Among these benefits are the potential for cost savings, environmental benefits, and improved customer service. By switching from traditional electricity providers to providers that offer green or renewable energy sources, customers can reduce their carbon footprint and support more environmentally friendly electricity generation. Electricity provider switching can also provide customers with better customer service since providers compete on their level of customer support. In some countries, electricity providers are state-owned monopolies, thus making it difficult for electricity consumers to switch providers as there is no competition to create an incentive for better service and rates. However, in many countries like the United States, there exist electricity service providers that do compete for customers, allowing for electricity provider switching to occur with ease. Electricity provider switching is a simple process and can be done over the phone, online, or through mail. However, customers should carefully consider the price plans, contract terms, customer service, reliability, and environmental policies of the provider they are considering switching to in order to ensure that they receive the best service possible. In conclusion, electricity provider switching can offer numerous benefits to customers, including cost savings, environmental benefits, and improved customer service. Thus, electricity consumers should take advantage of the existing retail energy market competition to switch to electricity providers that offer better rates, terms, and services.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3226406}

He was born in the Owari Province in 1545 to a family of samurai. Hidekatsu rose to fame during the battles waged by various clans in the region. He served under Oda Nobunaga in numerous campaigns against rival warlords and played a crucial role in the conquest of the capital city of Kyoto. Hidekatsu was originally named Yamauchi Kazutoyo and later changed his name to Hashiba Hidekatsu after swearing allegiance to the powerful Oda clan. He was a talented strategist and an expert in the art of battle. Hidekatsu was known for his bravery and loyalty to his commanders. He was instrumental in many of Oda Nobunaga's victories, including the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, where he served as a frontline commander. After the death of Nobunaga, Hidekatsu continued to serve under the leader's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He spent several years fighting alongside Hideyoshi in various battles, including the Invasion of Korea in 1592. Hidekatsu was highly respected by his fellow warriors and was known for his unwavering loyalty to his lord. Towards the end of his life, Hidekatsu retired from military service and devoted himself to the pursuit of the arts. He was highly skilled in calligraphy, poetry and tea ceremony, and his artistic works are still admired today. Today, Hashiba Hidekatsu is remembered as one of the greatest military commanders of the Sengoku period. His bravery, loyalty, and remarkable military skills have earned him a place in Japanese history.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cartographic censorship\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cartographic censorship is the  deliberate modification of publicly available maps in order to disguise, remove, or obfuscate potentially strategic locations or buildings, such as military bases, power plants or transmitters. Sensitive objects and places have been removed from maps since historic times, sometimes as a disinformation tactic in times of war, and also to serve competitive political and economic interests, such as during the Age of Discovery when strategic geographic information was highly sought after. In modern times requests for censorship are sent to Google Earth for certain sites that are deemed to pose security risks for national governments.\n\nHistory\nThe renowned map historian, J.B. Harley, wrote in 1989:\n\nThroughout the history of modern cartography in the West ... there have been numerous instances of where maps have been falsified, of where they have been censored or kept secret, or of where they have surreptitiously contradicted the rules of their proclaimed scientific status.\n\nThe early policy of secrecy proved difficult to enforce and soon maps became subject to censorship and falsification.  Cartographic disinformation has long been a weapon in political propaganda, military counter-intelligence and covert diplomacy.\n\nMaps are weapons of war and the falsification of maps is a legitimate ruse de guerre. However, such Machiavellian arts were not confined to wartime, particularly in an age when there was very little peacetime. Fake maps were a weapon for all seasons, to be used against all rivals, political and commercial.\n\nNorth America \n\nIn October 1941, before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that he had \"a secret map\" of South America titled 'Luftverkehrsnetz der Vereinigten Staaten Süd-Amerikas Hauptlinien'. He said the map had been \"made in Germany by Hitler's government\" and that it showed that the Nazis had designs against the United States. It was a fake map, probably created by British intelligence agents, but Roosevelt may have thought it was genuine.\n\nEurope\n\nIn the Age of Discovery there was a premium on geographic information: ports of call for wood and fresh water, deep natural harbours, shorter passages and straits.\n\nGermany \nCensorship of maps was also used in former East Germany, especially for the areas near the border to West Germany in order to make attempts of defection more difficult.\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, or VOC, had a mission to censor cartographic knowledge of newly explored regions. It complained when ships owned by its rival, the Australische Compagnie, entered the Pacific by a new passage round Cape Horn, named the Le Maire Strait. The VOC persuaded the Dutch government to prohibit the publication of this latest geographical information. However, the injunction was lifted after twelve months and Willem Blaeu and other cartographers were permitted to publish revised maps.\n\nPortugal\n\nThe German cartographer Henricus Martellus made his famous mappamundi (World Map), soon after the Portuguese navigator, Bartolomeu Dias, sailed round  the southern tip of Africa. The map is based on a Portuguese prototype (which has not survived), but the coast of southern Africa is greatly extended and dislocated. Some scholars have suggested that this distortion is a result of misinformation circulated by King John II. His purpose was to pretend that the new eastern sea route to Asia and was far longer than it actually is, in order to discourage foreign interlopers from profiting from Portuguese discoveries.\n\nChristopher Columbus may have consulted Martellus' map (or a copy) before leaving Spain in 1492 to find the western route to Asia.\n\nRussia\n\nIn 1765, the Swiss geographer Samuel Engel, accused the Russian government of deliberately falsifying maps by extending Siberia 30° eastward. Its purpose, according to Engel, was to exaggerate the length and difficulty of the Northeast Passage along the arctic coast, in the hope of discouraging rival European merchants from attempting this route to the Pacific and China.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFrancis Drake \n\nWhen Francis Drake sailed on his voyage round the world in 1577, he was given clear instructions that \"none shall make any charts or descriptions of the said voyage.\" Furthermore, all charts made or captured from foreigners had to be delivered to the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council. Two hundred years later, the Admiralty's instructions to Captain Cook were almost identical.\n\nCaptain Cook \n\nThe British Admiralty sent James Cook on his three Pacific voyages during the Second Hundred Years War when France and Britain were vying for commercial supremacy and control of shipping lanes around the world.\n\nCook has been accused of making \"major mistakes in his charting\", such as depicting \"Stewart Island as a peninsula, and the failure to determine the insular character of Tasmania\".\n\nHowever, Cook was the greatest navigator of his day and too experienced to make such errors. During his three Pacific voyages, Cook was on a mission to keep secret any strategic discoveries he made such as off-shore islands and deep, natural harbours. He would report such prizes to the Admiralty when he returned to London, but meanwhile he would omit them from his journal and charts. Cook's program of disinformation was first proposed in the book Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage (2018).\n\nIn 1770, Cook found Sydney Harbour by walking overland from Botany Bay, along an Aboriginal track connecting the two inlets. He also identified Bass Strait which separates Tasmania from mainland Australia. However, off-shore islands can provide a base from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power so he concealed Tasmania's insularity. Similarly, Cook depicted New Zealand's Stewart Island as a peninsula, concealing Foveaux Strait.\n\nCaptain Cook's fake maps were not fake enough for the Admiralty. It wanted even greater concealment of politically sensitive discoveries when it commissioned Dr. Hawkesworth to write the official account of Cook's voyages. Thus the Admiralty's engraver  deliberately altered and refined Cook's manuscript charts when preparing them for printing. Hawkesworth's \"Journals\" was a bestseller in Europe, and the Admiralty's fake maps misled Britain's rivals for decades.\n\nCold War \nIn the United Kingdom, during the Cold War period and shortly after, a number of military installations (including 'prohibited places') did not appear on commercially issued Ordnance Survey mapping. This practice was effectively curtailed with the mass availability of satellite imagery. Another aspect of map censorship in the UK is that the internal layout of HM Prison facilities were not shown on public OS mapping.\n\nFalse altitudes\nA variant of censorship of maps is putting in false altitudes. This can be important for predicting flooding. In World War I many German soldiers were killed in Belgium after their camps were flooded, even though the maps used by German military indicated the camp sites were not prone to flooding.\n\nModern use \nCensorship of maps is today still often applied, although it is less effective in the age of satellite picture services. A \"dead map\" is a term often applied to sensitive government maps that show the location of top secret facilities and other highly sensitive installations within a country. Russia, the United States and Great Britain all have such maps.\n\nGoogle Earth censors places that may be of special security concern. The following is a selection of such concerns:\n Former Indian president Abdul Kalam had expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in India.\n Indian Space Research Organization says that Google Earth poses a security threat to India and seeks dialogue with Google officials.\n The South Korean government has expressed concern that the software offers images of the presidential palace and various military installations that could possibly be used by North Korea.\n Operators of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney, Australia asked Google to censor high resolution pictures of the facility. However, they later withdrew the request.\n The government of Israel also expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in its territory, and applied pressure to have Israeli territory (and the Occupied Territories held by Israeli forces) appear in less clear detail.\n The Vice President of the United States' residence (Naval Observatory) in Washington, DC has been pixelated, as has the Federal Gold Depository at Fort Knox.\n From June 2007 until January 2009, downtown Washington, DC was shown using USGS aerial photography from the spring 2002, while the rest of the District of Columbia was shown using imagery from 2005.\n\nCensorship of maps is also applied by Google Maps, where certain areas are greyed out or areas are purposely left outdated with old imagery.\n\nIn Lebanon, all maps concerning the country are property of the Lebanese Army and are issued by the Directory of Geographic affairs of the Lebanese military. It is considered a felony to reproduce whole or portions of maps without the permission of the military, although maps can be issued to certain universities and urban design schools for use by students and can be issued to civilian upon presenting certain documents. A notice is written on the maps prohibiting reproduction, copying or sale of the map and that it should be returned to the Ministry of National Defense upon request. This policy is meant to prohibit terrorists, outlaws, and entities that are at war with Lebanon from obtaining those maps.\n\nSimilar cases \nLists of air traffic obstacles may not be published by many countries as many of them are strategically important (chimneys of power stations, radio masts, etc.)\n\nExample \n Hiding a VLF-transmitter of Russian Navy on a map.

The term is often used to describe instances where maps are altered or suppressed to promote a certain political agenda or to erase or obscure certain geographic features that may be considered sensitive or controversial by certain groups. One of the most common forms of cartographic censorship is the manipulation of borderlines or territorial boundaries. Governments may redraw national borders or dispute the legitimacy of existing boundaries to support their territorial claims or to challenge the claims of other countries. In some cases, governments may also censor maps to obscure the location of sensitive military installations or to downplay the severity of environmental or humanitarian crises. Another form of cartographic censorship involves erasing or obscuring the cultural or historical heritage of certain areas. This can involve removing the names of places that are associated with ethnic or religious minorities, or suppressing the depiction of certain historical events or landmarks that do not align with the government's official narrative. Cartographic censorship has been practiced throughout history and continues to be a topic of concern in the modern era. In some cases, it has been used as a tool of oppression and repression, while in others it has been used as a means of promoting national unity or protecting national security. While cartographic censorship can be a powerful tool for governments seeking to control their populations, it is also important to recognize the potential harm that it can cause. By manipulating maps and geographic information, governments can create a distorted view of reality that can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even violence. As such, it is important to remain vigilant and aware of the ways in which maps can be used to shape our understanding of the world around us.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15379681}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Finland Plot\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In Thailand politics, the Finland Plot, Finland Plan, Finland Strategy, Finland Conspiracy or Finland Declaration (, ) are names of a controversial conspiracy theory espoused by Sondhi Limthongkul and supporters affiliated with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) in 2006 describing a plot allegedly developed by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former left-wing student leaders to overthrow the former Thai monarch, take control of the nation, and establish a communist state.  The plot allegedly originated in Finland.\n\nThe allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government, despite the fact that no evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of a plot. Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.  The leaders of the 2006 military coup claimed Thaksin's alleged disloyalty as one of their rationales for seizing power.\n\nBackground \nProtests against Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra increased throughout 2005 and 2006 due to a variety of factors, including his April 2005 appearance at a merit-making ceremony at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the September 2005 cancellation of Sondhi Limthongkul's Muangthai Raisabdah television show, Thaksin's November 2005 plan to give local communities control of public schools, Thaksin's sale of Shin Corporation in January 2006, and Thaksin's alleged role in the March 2006 destruction of the Phra Phrom Erawan shrine.\n\nFinland Plot \n\nIn May 2006, on the eve of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 60th anniversary celebrations, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned Manager Daily newspaper published the details of what it called the \"Finland Plan,\" \"Finland Declaration,\" or \"Finland Strategy.\"  The articles claimed that Thaksin and former student leaders of Thailand's 1970s democratic movement met in Finland in 1999 to develop a plan to institute rule by a single party, overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, and hold elections for provincial governors.  The 5-part article was titled \"Finland Strategy: Thailand's Revolution Plan?\" was written by Pramote Nakhonthap and appeared on 17, 19, 22, 23 and 24 May 2006. Thaksin's alleged co-conspirators apparently included Thai Rak Thai party members Prommin Lertsuridej (Secretary-General to the Premier), Chaturon Chaisaeng (Deputy Prime Minister), Surapong Suebwonglee (Minister of Information and Communications Technology), Adisorn Piangket (Former Deputy Science Minister), Sutham Saengprathum (Deputy Interior Minister), and Phumtham Wechayachai (Deputy Transport Minister), all of whom had been affiliated with the Communist Party of Thailand following the massacre of 6 October 1976.\n\nThe allegations were taken up by several prominent critics, including leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, constitution drafter Chai-anan Samudavanija, Senator Sophon Supapong, writer Pramote Nakornthab, and Democrat leader Thaworn Senniam.\n\nNone of the accusers provided any evidence to back up their allegations.  Sondhi noted that his source was a Thai Rak Thai worker who had recently \"defected.\"\n\nVariations and denials \n\nVariations of the original theory were also proposed, including the claim that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, the claim that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, the claim that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing the powers of the monarch to a mere figurehead, and the claim that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and the claim that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.\n\nAnother variation claimed that Thaksin's co-conspirators were former members of the Communist Party of Thailand including Deputy Transport Minister Phumtham Wechayachai and had applied a theory of orthodox Marxism to map out the TRT strategy to promote capitalism.  This variation claimed that Thailand during the 1970s was still a semi-feudal society and needed to become a capitalist society as part of the transition to socialism.  The communists then worked with Thaksin to fully develop Thailand's capitalist economic system, destroy all remnants of feudalism, and privatize state-owned assets, while at the same time establishing a single-party dictatorship, all in order to create a socialist dictatorship.\n\nThe allegations were roundly denied by Thaksin Shinawatra and the leadership of his Thai Rak Thai party, including Surapong Suebwonglee and Prommin Lertsuridej. \n\nOn 30 May, Thaksin Shinawatra and Thana Benjathikul, a lawyer from the Thai Rak Thai party, sued Sondhi, editor Khunthong Lorserivanich, columnist Pramote Nakhonthap, executive Saowalak Thiranujanyong, and webmaster Panjapat Angkhasuwan for libel.  The lawsuit alleged that the articles were intended to ruin Thai Rak Thai and Thaksin's political future by making the public believe the party was planning to overturn the constitutional monarchy.  Thaksin's lawsuit attracted criticism and claims that Thaksin was trying to censor the media.\n\nImpact of the allegations \n  \nThe allegations damaged the popularity of Thaksin and his government.  Thaksin was forced to expend a significant amount of time and political capital on damage control, explaining his position and swearing his loyalty to the monarchy.\n\nIn an editorial, the influential anti-Thaksin newspaper The Nation noted:\n\nThe Nation noted that the actual existence of the Plot was not important—the mere invocation of royalty would be enough to damage the Thai Rak Thai party.  Many commentators noted the similarity between the Finland Plot allegations and the allegations used justify the massacre of students on 6 October 1976, which in the context of the Thailand political crisis, might justify a military coup.  The Thai military eventually successfully executed a coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.  One of the junta's stated rationales for the coup was that Thaksin had insulted the King.\n\nReferences \n\nPolitics of Thailand\nConspiracy theories in Asia\nConspiracy theories in Thailand\n2006 in Thailand\nCommunism in Thailand\nThaksin Shinawatra\nRepublicanism in Thailand\nHistorical events in Finland", "machine_text": "The Finland Plot, also known as the \"Tanner Affair,\" was a political scandal that took place in Finland during the 1950s. The plot involved accusations that a group of individuals, including the Finnish Prime Minister, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, and his successor, Karl-August Fagerholm, worked with the Soviet Union to maintain their power and influence in the Finnish government. The allegations were first made public by the Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Max Jakobson, in a series of articles published in the Swedish press in 1954. Jakobson claimed that Paasikivi and Fagerholm had made a secret deal with Soviet officials during the Moscow Conference in 1952, in which they agreed to follow pro-Soviet policies in exchange for Soviet support. The accusations sparked a public outcry in Finland, with many demanding an investigation into the matter. The Finnish Parliament established a commission to investigate the allegations, and over the next few months, the commission heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Jakobson, Paasikivi, and Fagerholm. In the end, the commission was unable to find any concrete evidence of a plot or conspiracy. However, the accusations had a significant impact on Finnish politics, damaging the reputations of Paasikivi and Fagerholm and contributing to a shift in Finnish foreign policy away from the Soviet Union. Today, the Finland Plot remains a controversial and divisive topic in Finnish politics and history. While some view it as a legitimate concern about Soviet influence in Finnish affairs, others see it as a politically motivated smear campaign against left-leaning politicians. Regardless of one's perspective, the Finland Plot serves as a reminder of the complex and often fraught relationship between Finland and its powerful neighbor to the east.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7042983}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Charles Thurstan Holland\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Charles Thurstan Holland  (1863–1941) was a general practitioner in Liverpool who was best known by his pioneering research in the field of Radiology. The Thurstan Holland sign is named after him.\n\nLife\n\nCharles Thurstan Holland was born in March 1863 at Bridgwater, Somerset to William Thomas Holland and his wife Florence Holland (née Florence Du Val), the second daughter of painter Charles Allen Du Val.\n\nHe studied medicine at the University College in London, qualifying in 1888. From October 1896 to 1904 he was honorary radiologist to the Royal Liverpool Hospital and from 1904 to 1923 to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary.\n\nHe started research on Radiology in 1896, after reading about Wilhelm Röntgen's experiments in this field. Thanks to his meticulous work and advancements in his technique, Holland was able to produce radiographs that were far in advance for many years, compared to the standard practice. Along with such names as Heinrich Albers-Schönberg (Germany), Antoine Béclère (France), Etienne Henrard (Belgium), Guido Holzknecht and Robert Kienböck (Austria), Thurstan Holland is considered one of the pioneers in Europe.\n\nHolland took part in the First World War as a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his abilities as radiologist were invaluable in treating patients with bullets lodged in their bodies. By the end of the War, a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned. In 1925 the British Institute of Radiology, under Holland's leadership invited delegates from a number of countries to attend the First International Congress on Radiation in London. This congress set up a framework for future meetings — future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, and be organised by the host country.\n\nThurstan Holland was also a talented photographer, being elected the first President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Photographers' Society.\n\nHe died on 16 January 1941 in Liverpool.\n\nPublications and citations\n\n1890s\nHolland, C.

Born in Hull, East Yorkshire on January 12, 1863, he was the son of a successful merchant and grew up in a well-educated family. Holland received his education at the University of London, where he studied chemistry and geology. Later, he worked as an assistant to the professor of Chemistry at the Royal School of Mines, where he gained expertise in crystallography and mineralogy. Throughout his career, Holland made several important contributions to the field of mineralogy. He was particularly interested in studying the crystal structures of minerals, and his work in this area led to the discovery of several new mineral species. In addition to his work in mineralogy, Holland also made important contributions to the field of petrology. He was known for his studies on metamorphic rocks, and he was one of the first scientists to recognize the important role that water plays in the formation of many types of rocks. Throughout his career, Holland published numerous scientific papers on a wide range of topics in mineralogy and petrology. He was widely respected by his colleagues for his expertise in these fields, and his work has continued to influence scientific research in these areas to this day. Holland was also a dedicated teacher and mentor to numerous students throughout his career. He was highly regarded by his students for his passion for science and his dedication to helping them achieve their academic goals. Charles Thurstan Holland died on May 23, 1941, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking scientific research and a commitment to advancing the field of geology. His work has had a lasting impact on the scientific community and continues to inspire new generations of researchers in mineralogy and petrology.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 47504596}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Yiddishkayt (organization)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Yiddishkayt is a Yiddish cultural and educational organization, based in Los Angeles, California.  Its offices are located in the Pellissier Building above the Wiltern Theater in the Koreatown District of Los Angeles. Its name refers to the cultural concept of yiddishkayt, (Yiddish culture, literally \"Jewishness\" or \"Yiddishness\"), which the American Jewish critic Irving Howe described not in religious terms, but rather as a humanism based in a \"readiness to live...beyond the clamor of self.\" According to the Yiddishkayt website, the organization seeks to \"inspire current and future generations with the artists, writers, musicians, performers, filmmakers, philosophers, and social justice activists whose yiddishkayt — their particular form of critical and compassionate engagement with humanity — emerged from the Jewish communities of Europe as they developed in constant contact with their non-Jewish neighbors.\"\n\nSince its founding in 1995, Yiddishkayt has become the largest organization devoted to yiddishkayt west of the Hudson and has produced six Yiddish festivals, a high school Yiddish language education program, two local cultural fellowships, 30 Los Angeles premiere, 16 US premiere and 5 world premiere presentations devoted to Yiddish culture, 10 cross-cultural performances, and partnerships with over 25 organizations and venues, including the Workmen's Circle, REDCAT, University of California, Los Angeles, Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. In 2009 and 2010, Yiddishkayt was named by Slingshot Fund as the \"50 of the most innovative organizations in Jewish life today.\"\n\nHistory and activities\nIn 1995 cultural festival organizer Aaron Paley — founder of Los Angeles nonprofits Community Arts Resources (CARS) and CicLAvia — produced a one-day festival of Yiddish culture that attracted close to 6,000 people, launching Yiddishkayt Los Angeles as an organization.\n\nUntil 2004, the organization's hallmark productions were the Yiddishkayt Festivals, comprising a one-day family festival with a week-long series of events spotlighting Yiddish culture in the mosaic of cultures that thrive in Los Angeles.  The first citywide Yiddishkayt Festival in 1998 featured 26 events in 19 venues, including many cross-cultural collaborations including a Klezmer-Mariachi commission and presentations at non-Jewish venues, such as the first reading of Yiddish at the Los Angeles Central Library. Yiddishkayt then expanded beyond the one-week festival model to a season of diverse, cultural programming including concerts, lectures, films and other events with artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians and academics pushing the boundaries of contemporary Yiddish culture. Examples of events produced by Yiddishkayt in the late 2000s include 2008’s \"The ¡Viva Yiddish! Project: The Yiddish-Latino Sound of Los Angeles\" at California Plaza — in partnership with Grand Performance and featuring members of LA's Ozomatli — and 2009’s Doikayt: A Los Angeles Community-Wide Artist/Yiddish Passover Seder in partnership with the Jewish Artists Initiative (JAI).\n\nYiddishkayt has also applied the principle of Doikayt through local history programming including tours of the neighborhood of Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, a historically multi-ethnic area that was once the hub of Los Angeles Yiddish cultural life. Stops on the tour have included the Breed Street Shul, the former Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center, and Phillips Music Company, a store that served a diverse range of musicians including Mickey Katz, Los Lobos, and Thee Midniters.\n\nAside from producing performances, festivals, and tours, Yiddishkayt has also worked on Yiddish language and cultural educational projects for both youth and adults. In December 2000, Yiddishkayt organized \"The Art of Yiddish: Cultural Nourishment for a New Age,\" a \"two-week immersion in the living language.\" Yiddish scholar Jeffrey Shandler has characterized Yiddishkayt's presentation of Yiddish culture and language as \"nature and nurture, art and science, as well as old and new, local and exotic, singular and enduring, inscrutable and accessible.\" In 2005, with major funding from the Steven Spielberg-founded Righteous Persons Foundation, Yiddishkayt embarked on a three-year pilot program to reintroduce Yiddish language and culture as a possible systematic course of instruction in American Jewish day schools, including the de Toledo High School.\n\nSince the early 2010s, under the directorship of Robert Adler Peckerar, Yiddishkayt's focus has shifted to occupy a more international, inter-cultural, and digital presence. The most significant venture has been the Wallis Annenberg Helix Fellowship. Originally launched as Helix Project, the program was an immersive summer travel education program for university and graduate students. Beginning in 2011, Yiddishkayt has taken groups of students on subsidized trips through the historic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (modern-day Belarus, Poland, and Lithuania), a territory that was home to millions of Yiddish-speaking Litvaks and where Yiddish was recognized as an official language. The Helix Project is designed to immerse its participants in the multi-ethnic culture of Jewish Lithuania, and students visit notable sites in Eastern European Jewish cultural and political history, including the urban centers of Minsk, Grodno, Brest-Litovsk, Białystok, and Vilnius, as well as places relevant to the lives of Yiddish cultural figures such as the poets Moyshe Kulbak and Abraham Sutzkever, the actor and director Solomon Mikhoels, anarchist thinker and activist Emma Goldman, and the members of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. Accompanying the Helix Fellows are scholars in the fields of Jewish language, literature, and history, as well as writers, musicians, and artists who incorporate Yiddish language and culture into their work. Early in 2019, Yiddishkayt announced a major gift from Wallis Annenberg to support the Helix project and develop it into a broader program, the Wallis Annenberg Helix Fellowship. The Fellowship now attracts artists and scholars from around the world for a year-long immersive program with a month-long residential component to explore Jewish history, culture, and art.\n\nActivism and controversies\nIn recent years, Yiddishkayt's leadership has been outspoken on Yiddish issues, especially the Los Angeles and broader American Jewish establishment's attitudes towards Yiddish culture.\n\nWhile leading a tour of Jewish Boyle Heights in 2006, Yiddishkayt founder Aaron Paley discovered that the historic Soto-Michigan Jewish Community Center had been demolished without Boyle Heights community leaders or Jewish historical activists being notified. In the LA Times, Paley denounced the demolition and its consequences for Boyle Heights' historical memory, calling the community center \"a place where multicultural politics began.\"\n\nIn May, 2013, Yiddishkayt Executive Director Rob Adler Peckerar published an open letter on the organization's website lamenting the \"state of Jewish philanthropy\" in the wake of his attempts to fundraise for the Helix Project. According to Adler Peckerar, his solicitations were met on multiple occasions with criticisms that the trip did not feature \"enough death,\" did not visit Israel, and was open to non-Jewish students. Additionally, a Jewish studies scholar was quoted in a Los Angeles Times article as saying that the Helix Project's focus on the role of secular yiddishkayt in historical Jewish identity was \"just stupid\" and an \"attempt to rewrite Jewish history.\"\n\nAlso in 2013, the Los Angeles Times published a story documenting Adler Peckerar's discovery of the dilapidated Mount Zion Cemetery in East Los Angeles and the grave of the Yiddish writer Lamed Shapiro. Following the article's publication, Los Angeles philanthropist Shlomo Rechnitz donated $250,000 towards the cemetery's restoration, a project undertaken by a rabbi from Chabad of Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn a blog post on the Yiddishkayt website, Adler Peckerar criticized the restoration efforts on the part of Chabad and the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, especially given the leftist politics and secularism of Lamed Shapiro and many other Los Angeles Jews interred at Mount Zion. \"Rather than to look at what a neglected cemetery might tell us about a community’s relationship to its past or reconsider the disregard shown to its once-distinguished cultural icons,\" Adler Peckerar wrote. \"The immediate reaction was to cover our collective shame and get renovations started.\"\n\nReferences\n\nAshkenazi Jewish culture in Los Angeles\nJewish organizations based in the United States\nYiddish culture in the United States", "machine_text": "Yiddishkayt (organization) is a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, California, United States, dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Yiddish language, culture, and history.

Hammana sits at an altitude of 1200m (about 4000 ft) above sea-level. It is in the Mount Lebanon Governorate in the district (or Caza) of Baabda. Hammana is bordered by the towns of Falougha, Shbaniye, Khraybe, Bmariam, Khalwet and Mdeirej.\n\nEtymology \nThe word \"Hammana\" may have come from the name of the Phoenician Sun God \"Hammon\" or \"Hamman\". These two names are derived from the word \"Hama\" which means heat of the sun.\n\nHistory \nThe 19th century French poet, novelist and statesman Alphonse De Lamartine visited Lebanon and spent some time in Hammana. He described the town and its surrounding lush valley in his Voyages en Orient (1835) as \"one of the most beautiful prospects ever presented to the human eye to scan in the works of a god as known as NZ007\".\n\nHammana has a rich diversity of religious communities consisting of Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Muslims and Druze.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Final Doom\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Final Doom is a first-person shooter video game developed by TeamTNT, and Dario and Milo Casali, and was released by id Software and distributed by GT Interactive Software in 1996. It was released for MS-DOS and Macintosh computers, as well as for the PlayStation, although the latter featured a selection of levels from Final Doom and from Master Levels for Doom II.\n\nFinal Doom consists of two 32-level episodes (or megawads), TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. Unlike TNT: Evilution, which was officially licensed, The Plutonia Experiment was made by request of the team at id Software. The story in both episodes take place after the events of Doom II. TNT: Evilution features a new soundtrack not found in Doom and Doom II.\n\nGameplay\n\nFinal Doom plays identically to Doom II: Hell on Earth, and even features the same weapons, items, and monsters. The original game is widely considered to be significantly more difficult than its predecessors Doom and Doom II.\n\nThe gameplay in the PlayStation version of Final Doom is nearly identical to that found in the PlayStation version of Doom, and, in addition, it was compatible with the PlayStation Mouse. Compared to the MS-DOS original, the PlayStation version's overall difficulty was significantly reduced. Many of the harder levels were removed and those that remained often had enemies taken out (most noticeably the Cyberdemon being removed from the level 'Baron's Lair'). As in the original PlayStation version of Doom, many of the larger levels from the original MS-DOS versions of Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II were removed, and both the Arch-vile and Spider Mastermind monsters were removed, due to technical constraints. This limited the PlayStation version to 30 levels in total. The more traditional rock tracks featured in Final Doom were replaced by a creepier ambient soundtrack by Aubrey Hodges, who later composed the music for Doom 64 in 1997.\n\nThere are several noticeable alterations to the presentation of Final Doom in the PlayStation version compared to the computer versions. The simplistic title screens featured in the computer versions have been replaced by a more elaborate title screen that features the animated flame-filled sky texture from the original PlayStation version of Doom. Many of the levels' sky textures have been replaced by different ones; some levels' skies are replaced by sky textures seen in previous Doom games, whereas others now feature a new starry sky texture. Finally, most of the level layouts are simplified, similar to previous Doom console ports, and the frame rate of the game is often lower than it was in the first PlayStation Doom game.\n\nPlot\n\nTNT: Evilution\nIn TNT: Evilution, the UAC are once again intent on developing and experimenting with dimensional gateway technology. They set up a base on one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well; when the first experimental gateway is opened, they annihilate the forces of Hell. Research continues with more confidence and all security measures turned at the gateway.\n\nA few months later, the yearly supply ship comes ahead of schedule, and looks strange and unusually big on the radar. The lax radar operators decide that there is nothing to worry about. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built out of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship's enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the entire facility is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.\n\nThe main character, the nameless space marine (who was revealed to be the marine commander on the moon) has been away on a walk at that time and thus escapes death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp, he rushes back to the base where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. He then swears that he will avenge his slain troops and sets out to kill as many demons as possible.\n\nIn the end, the marine defeats the Icon of Sin and the game describes \"something rumbles in the distance. A blue light glows within the ruined skull of the demon-spitter.\"\n\nThe Plutonia Experiment\nIn The Plutonia Experiment, after Hell's catastrophic invasion of Earth, the global governments decide to take measures against any possible future invasion, knowing that the powers of Hell still remained strong. The UAC is refounded under completely new management (the old trustees and stockholders were all dead anyway) and aims at developing tools that would prevent demonic invasions.\n\nThe scientists start working on a device known as the Quantum Accelerator that is intended to close invasion Gates and stop possible invasions. The experiments are carried out in a secret research complex, with a stationed detachment of marines. The work seems to be going well but the creatures from Outside have their attention drawn towards the new research. A Gate opens in the heart of the complex and unnatural horrors pour out. The Quantum Accelerator performs superbly: the Gate is quickly closed and the invasion is stopped. Research continues more boldly.\n\nOn the next day, a ring of 7 Gates opens and an even greater invasion begins. For one hour the Quantum Accelerators manage to close 6 of the Gates, but the Hellish army has become too numerous and too strong. The complex is overrun. Everyone is slain, or zombified. The last Gate of Hell remains open, guarded by a Gatekeeper: a powerful, enormous and ancient demon that has the power to open Dimensional Gates and control or protect them.\n\nThe government, frantic that the Quantum Accelerator will be destroyed or used against humanity, orders all marines to the site at once. The player, the nameless space marine, was on leave at the beach. He was also closest to the site and gets there first. There he discovers that there is much demonic activity (howling, chanting, machine sounds) within the complex; the Gatekeeper is obviously working on something, and his work would soon reach some awful climax. He also realizes that when the marines arrive, they would not be able to penetrate the heavily infested complex, despite the firepower and support they will have. The marine decides to enter the complex and stop the Gatekeeper alone.\n\nDevelopment\nWork on TNT: Evilution was started by TeamTNT, a group of WAD-making hobbyists who were active on the advanced Doom editing mailing list. Just days before it was to be released as a free download online, the project was acquired by id Software, and finished in November 1995.\n\nBrothers Dario and Milo Casali, who had contributed four levels to TNT: Evilution, were assigned the task of creating what became The Plutonia Experiment after having sent an eight-level WAD they had created to American McGee and managing to impress him along with the rest of the id Software crew. They created 16 levels each for The Plutonia Experiment in four months time, and submitted them in January 1996. Unlike their contributions to TNT: Evilution, which were edited after submission (four were also rejected due to being too large to run on the computers of the day), these were the final revisions of the levels, and Dario Casali later commented about the fact that no changes were requested: \"Thank God because I was ready to throw my computer out the window at the time.\"\n\nDario Casali acknowledged the difficulty level of The Plutonia Experiment in an interview on Doomworld, stating \"Plutonia was always meant for people who had finished Doom 2 on hard and were looking for a new challenge. I always played through the level I had made on hard, and if I could beat it too easily, I made it harder, so it was a challenge for me.\"\n\nReception\n\nReviewing the PC version in GameSpot, Jim Varner argued that Final Doom is a waste of money, since it is essentially just a new set of level maps for Doom, and there were already thousands of such maps available to download for free on the internet.\n\nWhile Major Mike of GamePro criticized that Final Doom has no new enemies or weapons, and that the PlayStation version includes only 30 levels as compared to the PC version's 64, he was pleased with the \"huge, perplexing, and sometimes sadistic levels\" and the new scenery, and considered Doom still a compelling enough game that simply more of the same was enough to satisfy. PlayStation Magazine gave it a score of 9/10, calling it \"essential\". A reviewer for Next Generation was less impressed, remarking that a side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation version of the original Doom reveals that Final Doom has a much lower frame rate, less precise control, and more visible seams in the textures. Three of the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly said they were tired of seeing ports of Doom, and that Final Doom was simply another such port with new level maps. They also said that the game engine had become severely outdated in the years since Doom was first released. Crispin Boyer was the one dissenting voice, expressing enthusiasm for the new level designs.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n Interview with Dario Casali (1998) by Doomworld\n\nExternal links\n Final Doom page at PlanetDOOM\n Final Doom at TeamTNT's official website\n Dario Casali's The Plutonia Experiment page\n id Software's official Final Doom page\n Comparison of PC and Playstation Final Doom at ClassicDOOM\n\n1996 video games\nCooperative video games\nDoom (franchise)\nVideo games about demons\nDoom engine games\nDOS games\nGames commercially released with DOSBox\nGT Interactive Software games\nId Software games\nClassic Mac OS games\nPlayStation (console) games\nPlayStation 3 games\nPlayStation Network games\nVideo games developed in the United States\nVideo games scored by Aubrey Hodges\nVideo games with 2.5D graphics\nVideo games with digitized sprites\nVideo games set in hell\nWilliams video games\nWindows games\nVideo game spin-offs\nSprite-based first-person shooters\nHorror video games\nde:Doom#Final Doom", "machine_text": "Final Doom is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and released on June 17, 1996. It is an expansion of the hugely popular game series Doom, which was first released in 1993. Final Doom added two new episodes to the original game, titled TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. The game follows the same gameplay as its predecessors. The player assumes the role of an unnamed space marine who battles through levels filled with demons and other horrific creatures. The game features a wide range of weapons, including shotguns, rocket launchers, and plasma guns. TNT: Evilution was created by TeamTNT, a group of Doom modders who had previously released several free modifications for the game. It features 32 new levels and is known for its difficulty level. The Plutonia Experiment was created by a different team and also features 32 new levels. Final Doom received mixed reviews upon its release. Some critics praised the game for its challenging levels and new content, while others criticized it for being too similar to the previous games in the series. Despite this, Final Doom remains a popular game in the Doom franchise and is still played by gamers today. In addition to its new levels, Final Doom also introduced new enemies and features. The game's storyline was expanded upon, with the player being sent to a remote research facility on the moons of Jupiter to investigate an outbreak of demonic activity. The game also introduced a new weapon, the BFG 9000, which fires a powerful ball of energy that can destroy multiple enemies at once. Overall, Final Doom is a worthy addition to the Doom franchise and is a must-play for fans of the original game. Its new levels, enemies, and features provide a fresh challenge for even the most experienced Doom players.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1212015}

Often referred to as bathroom in a box, they also arrange for the installation of all products through their network of Bath Simple Certified Contractors and offer a zero waste recycling program.\n\nHistory\n\nBased in Richmond, California, Bath Simple was launched by John Crowley and Bill Hunscher in 2010. The idea came from the difficulty that both faced in remodeling their bathrooms, as they had to deal with numerous suppliers and contractors to complete their projects. There was no predictability in either the price of the bathroom remodel, or the time required to complete the job. The company was founded to streamline the process for bathroom remodeling by allowing consumers to have a single place to coordinate all of their project details from design through installation. Both saw a problem not with the products, but the process used to select the products and deliver them to consumers. The concept behind Bath Simple was to leverage a “curated” line of high quality bathroom products combined with a high-touch design experience to make the process easier for consumers to design their bathrooms, order/receive their products, and have the installation delivered  from a single source.\n\nIn 2011, Bath Simple expanded into the San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Boston, and New York markets. The financing for the expansion came from Blueshift Partners, LLC, and additional angel investors and industry partners.\n\nProcess\n\nThe Bath Simple process starts online at their website where a customer can learn about the company and peruse the product catalogue and  design ideas. Once a customer is ready to begin the design process, they answer a few questions about style and budget, whereupon the company arranges a free in-home consultation with a Bath Simple Certified Designer. Once the design is finalized, Bath Simple has all of the materials sent to their warehouse and then packaged in a box. The box is then sent to the customer as opposed to the customer receiving numerous boxes from numerous different manufacturers.\n\nBath Simple pairs each customer with a local Bath Simple Certified Contractor for installation of their projects.

Although it is one of Georgia's smallest towns, Signagi serves as a popular tourist destination due to its location at the heart of Georgia's wine-growing regions, as well as its picturesque landscapes, pastel houses and narrow, cobblestone streets. Located on a steep hill, Signagi overlooks the vast Alazani Valley, with the Caucasus Mountains visible at a distance.\n\nEtymology \nThe name of the town comes from Old Turkic word of  (, ), meaning \"shelter\" or \"asylum\".\n\nHistory \nSignagi is located in the Kakheti region of Georgia, first settled in the Paleolithic period. Throughout its history, Signagi or Sighnaghi was known to the local population as Kambechovani, and later as Kisikhi or Kisiki. The word Sighnaghi in the Turkic language means shelter or trench. Signagi as a settlement was first recorded in the early 18th century. In 1762, King Heraclius II of Georgia sponsored the construction of the town and erected a fortress to defend the area from marauding attacks by Dagestani tribesmen.\n\nAccording to the 1770 census, 100 families, chiefly craftsmen and merchants, lived in Signagi. When Georgia was annexed by Imperial Russia in 1801, Signagi (Signakh) was officially granted town status and became a center of the Signakh uyezd () within the Tiflis Governorate in 1802. In 1812, Signakh joined the rebellion with the rest of Kakheti against Russian rule. During the Caucasian War, the town \"was considered an important point on account of its proximity to\" Dagestan.\n\nThe town quickly grew in size and population and became an agricultural center in the Soviet Union. The severe economic crisis in post-Soviet Georgia heavily affected the town, but a major reconstruction project recently launched by the Government of Georgia and co-funded by several international organizations intends to both address an increasing tourist interest and modernize infrastructure.\n\nGeography and Climate \nThe town has an area of 2.978 ha with 24.3% being residential. Signagi is approximately 113 km southeast of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Signagi District is adjacent, on the town’s east and southwest sides. Signagi is situated in the eastern foothills of the Gombori Range, a watershed between the Iori and Alazani valleys, in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. At an elevation of about 790 m above sea level, the town overlooks the Alazani Valley and faces the Greater Caucasus mountains.\n\nSignagi has a mild Mediterranean-like climate. There are four seasons, with winters being moderately cold while summers can be hot. The highest average temperature is in July at 24.3°C while the lowest average temperature is in January at 0.2°C.

He was born in Koudougou, a town located in the central region of the country, on February 4th, 1949. Natama was one of the key figures in the Pan-Africanist movement in Burkina Faso and was also a member of the Marxist-Leninist party. Natama was a student at the University of Ouagadougou in the 1970s and was involved in various student organizations promoting political activism. He became a well-known leader of the Burkinabé left-wing group, and his political theories focused on African socialism, Marxism, and anti-colonialism. Natama was imprisoned several times during his lifetime due to his political activism. He used these imprisonments as an opportunity to promote his political beliefs and increase his support amongst the common people of Burkina Faso. His teachings started to gain ground, and he accumulated a large following. Due to his activism, Natama was frequently targeted by the government, but he remained committed to his cause and continued his political activities. In August 1983, Natama and President Thomas Sankara led a popular insurrection, also known as the Burkinabé Revolution, which overthrew the regime of Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo. Natama was one of the key figures in this revolution and was instrumental in the formation of the National Revolutionary Council (CNR). However, in 1986, Natama was removed from his role as Minister of National Security in the CNR and relocated to an agricultural project in the north of the country. Toussaint Natama passed away in Ouagadougou on March 9, 1993, at the age of 44. His legacy remains in Burkinabé political circles, where he is still recognized as a hero and a pioneer of Burkinabé socialism. Several public facilities, including streets and buildings, have been named after him to commemorate his dedication to the country's fight for justice.

The term is widely used in various contexts, including biological, psychological, sociological, and cultural adaptations. Adaptation is an essential function that allows organisms and societies to manage and survive changes in their environment. In biology, Adaptatsiya refers to the genetic, physiological, and behavioral changes that occur in a species over time to cope with changing environmental conditions. These changes can be the result of natural selection, mutation, or gene flow. For example, some animals adapt to their environment through camouflage and mimicry to protect themselves from predators. Some plants have developed drought-tolerant roots and leaves to thrive in arid conditions. In psychology, Adaptatsiya refers to the process of adjusting to new experiences and situations. This process may involve modifying one's behavior, attitudes, and beliefs to match the demands of a specific environment. For example, immigrants have to adapt to their new culture and language when they move to a foreign country. In sociology, Adaptatsiya refers to social adjustments and changes that individuals or groups make in response to changes in their social and cultural environment. This process may involve changes in social norms, values, and beliefs. For example, different cultures have different attitudes towards gender roles, family structures, and religion. In conclusion, Adaptatsiya is a crucial process that allows individuals, species, and societies to adapt and thrive in changing environments. It plays a vital role in biology, psychology, sociology, and culture. By understanding and promoting adaptation, we can better understand and appreciate the diversity and resilience of life.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 44164573}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Alan Marriott (footballer)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Alan Marriott (born 3 September 1978) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.\n\nIn a career that lasted from 1997 until 2014. Marriott came through the ranks at Tottenham Hotspur he went on to notably spend 9 years with Lincoln City where he was involved in two play-off final defeats at the Millennium Stadium whilst playing under Keith Alexander. Marriott amassed 358 League appearances for the Imps and later had a spell with Rushden & Diamonds before a five year stint at Mansfield Town in which he was the clubs player of the season during the 2009–10 season and the Conference National title in 2012.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career\nMarriott began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, signing a professional contract in the summer of 1997 following the completion of his two-year youth training scheme.\n\nReleased by Spurs at the completion of the 1998–99 season, Marriott linked up with Lincoln City, initially on trial and then on a three-month contract following a recommendation from one-time Lincoln manager and then Tottenham's Director of Youth, Colin Murphy. In October 1999 he agreed a two-year contract with the Imps and went on to make his first team debut on 12 February 2000 in a 2–1 home victory over Torquay United. He retained his place for the remainder of the season which culminated in him being awarded Lincoln's Young Player of the Year.\n\nMarriott began the following season as the established number one choice and, following a series of impressive performances, was rewarded with a new three-year contract at the end of September 2000. In a 1–1 draw away to Carlisle United on 2 December 2000, Marriott limped off injured after 37 minutes with a knee injury; this kept him away from the first team for a three-month spell. The season would conclude with Marriott named Away Player of the Season.\n\n140 consecutive league appearances\n\nA shaky start to the 2001–02 season, which saw errors in the games against Halifax Town, Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United, caused Marriott to be replaced by Paul Pettinger in the Lincoln goal. However, following a 1–0 home defeat to Bristol Rovers on 15 September 2001, Marriott was restored to first team. Although he was forced off injured at half time in the 1–0 home defeat to Southend United on 16 March 2003, it would be exactly three years, from the 1–1 away draw with Luton Town on 18 September 2001, until the 0–0 away draw with Bristol Rovers on 18 September 2004, before he would miss another league game: a total of 140 consecutive appearances. Injury would cause him to miss the 1–1 home draw with Chester City on 25 September 2004.\n\nThe Keith Alexander era\n\nFollowing Lincoln's move into administration towards the end of the 2001–02 season, the club appointed Keith Alexander as manager. Alexander based his team around a solid defensive unit and it was, perhaps, this period which saw Marriott's best performances. Against all expectations, Lincoln reached the play-off final in the 2002–03 season, conceding just 37 league goals with Marriott keeping 18 clean sheets in the league. Despite the disappointment of defeat in the final to AFC Bournemouth, Marriott agreed a new two-year contract in the summer of 2003.\n\nThe 2003–04 season saw Lincoln reach the play-offs once again, with Marriott to the fore with 17 clean sheets in the league, 10 of them away from Sincil Bank. Marriott's efforts were rewarded with second place in the voting for Lincoln's Player of the Season but he collected the Bill Stacey Memorial Trophy after being named Away Player of the Season.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw a third unsuccessful tilt at the play-offs, though Marriott managed to keep 19 clean sheets in the league. He became the 28th Lincoln player to start 250 competitive games when keeping his 72nd Football League clean sheet in the 1–0 home victory over Swansea City on 9 April 2005; Lincoln manager Keith Alexander recognised the feat by making Marriott captain for the game. In June 2005 he agreed a new three-year contract with the Imps.\n\nThe 1–1 home draw with Bury on 15 April 2006 saw Marriott become only the 13th player in Lincoln's history to have started 300 competitive matches. Lincoln marked the occasion by making Marriott captain for the game.\n\nA season of records\nThe 2006–07 season saw Marriott once again ever-present in the Lincoln goal, and was memorable not only for him reaching 300 league appearances but also breaking a number of the club's goalkeeping records. The 300th appearance came in the 2–2 away draw to Bury on 18 January 2007 with Marriott becoming just the ninth player in Lincoln's history to reach this figure. His 309th league appearance in the 1–0 home victory over Barnet on 17 March 2007 saw him equal Dan McPhail's club record for Football League appearances by a goalkeeper; he would claim the record for himself when appearing in the following week's 3–2 home defeat to Swindon Town. In keeping a clean sheet in the 0–0 draw away to Bristol Rovers on 21 April 2007, Marriott equalled McPhail's club record of 97 clean sheets in The Football League whilst simultaneously passing McPhail's total club record of 102 clean sheets; Marriott's clean sheet the following week in the 0–0 away draw with Grimsby Town saw him surpass The Football League record.\n\nFinal Lincoln City season\n2007–08 began with Marriott achieving yet another notable record: his clean sheet in the 2–0 victory against Accrington Stanley on 25 August 2007 saw him become the first goalkeeper in Lincoln's history to keep 100 clean sheets in The Football League. However, Lincoln's form in the league was not so notable, resulting in the dismissal of manager John Schofield in October 2007. The newly appointed Peter Jackson's first signing was goalkeeper Ben Smith, on loan from Doncaster Rovers, a move which saw Marriott dropped. Although he retained his place in January, Marriott's contract was not renewed at the end of the season, bringing an end to nine seasons at Lincoln in which he made 351 league appearances, conceding 414 goals and keeping 106 clean sheets in the process. In a poll on the official Lincoln City website of the best 100 players to ever play for the club, Marriott was placed 19th by Lincoln fans.\n\nRushden & Diamonds and Mansfield Town\nOn 9 July 2008, Marriott signed for Conference National side Rushden & Diamonds. He made only 12 league appearances for the Diamonds before being signed by Mansfield Town on 8 January 2009 on a short-term contract. Seven clean sheets in his first nine games, in which he conceded just two goals, saw Marriott offered a new contract, which he signed in March 2009. Marriott scored a goal from his own penalty area against Wrexham on 20 April 2012.\nIn May 2012 Marriott signed a new contract ahead of the 2012–13 season. Marriott made his 200th league appearance for Mansfield in a 1–0 win over AFC Wimbledon in March 2014. Marriott was offered a new contract at the end of the season, though he left the club after turning it down.\n\nHonours\nLincoln City\nFootball League Third Division/Football League Two play-off finalist (2): 2002–03, 2004–05\nFootball League Third Division/Football League Two play-off semi-finalist (3): 2003–04, 2005–06, 2006–07\n\nMansfield Town\nConference National winner: 2012–13\nConference National play-off semi-finalist: 2011–12\nFA Trophy finalist: 2010–11\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nProfile at official Mansfield Town website\n\n1978 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Bedford\nEnglish footballers\nAssociation football goalkeepers\nTottenham Hotspur F.C. players\nLincoln City F.C. players\nRushden & Diamonds F.C. players\nMansfield Town F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nNational League (English football) players\nFootballers from Bedfordshire", "machine_text": "Alan Marriott (born 16 October 1977) is a retired English footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

They are commonly referred to as deer mice or deermice, not to be confused with the chevrotain or \"mouse deer\". They are New World mice only distantly related to the common house and laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. From this relative, Peromyscus species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair-coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word Peromyscus comes from Greek words meaning \"booted mouse\". They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of \"deer mouse\" (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.\n\nThe most common species of deer mice in the continental United States are two closely related species, P. maniculatus and P. leucopus. In the United States, Peromyscus is the most populous mammalian genus overall, and has become notorious in the western United States as a carrier of hantaviruses.\n\nReservoir of human disease\n\nHantavirus \nThe deer mouse came to the attention of the public when it was discovered to be the primary reservoir species for Sin Nombre hantavirus.\n\nLyme disease \nA recent study in British Columbia of 218 deer mice showed 30% (66) were seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease.\n\nOther diseases \nEhrlichiosis and babesiosis are also carried by the deer mouse.\n\nUse as a laboratory animal \nWhile wild populations are sometimes studied, Peromyscus species are also easy to breed and keep in captivity, although they are more energetic and difficult to handle than the relatively more tame M. musculus. For certain studies, they are also favored over the laboratory mouse (M. musculus domestica) and the laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica).  Apart from their importance in studying infectious diseases, Peromyscus species are useful for studying phylogeography, speciation, chromosomes, genetics, ecology, population genetics, conservation and evolution in general.  They are also useful for researching repetitive-movement disorders. Their use in aging research is because Peromyscus spp., despite being of similar size to the standard laboratory mouse, have maximum lifespans of 5–7 years, compared to the 3-year maximum lifespan of ad libitum-fed laboratory strains or wild-caught M. musculus.\n\nThe Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University of South Carolina was established by Professor Wallace Dawson in 1985 to raise animals of the peromyscine species for research and educational use. This institute maintains populations of several different species (including Peromyscus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus melanophrys, Peromyscus eremicus, and Peromyscus aztecus).

They are distributed throughout North and Central America, and some species are found in South America. There are 56 recognized species of Peromyscus, with the majority of them being found in the United States and Mexico. Deer mice are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. The physical characteristics of Peromyscus are similar among the different species. They have grayish-brown fur, with a white underbelly and large eyes. Their tails are long and scaly, and their hind legs are longer than their front legs. Most species of Peromyscus are nocturnal and primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and insects. Deer mice are important members of many North American ecosystems, serving as a prey base for predators such as snakes, birds of prey, and carnivorous mammals. In addition to their ecological importance, some species of Peromyscus are used in scientific research. They are genetically similar to humans, making them a useful model organism for studying genetics and disease. Peromyscus have been important to indigenous peoples for millennia. They are an important food source, and their fur was used for clothing and other items.

The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role.\n\nMullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school\n\nPlot\n\nThe story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets.\n\nBegrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the Hyde Park pet cemetery, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and “only dogs can be depended upon”. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one.\n\nThe following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for. \nThe children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as “he wasn’t their grandfather”, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree.\n\nThe following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.\n\nCast\n Peter Sellers as Sam  \n Donna Mullane as Liz  \n John Chaffey as Mark  \n David Daker as Bob Ellis\n Marjorie Yates as Chrissie Ellis  \n Patricia Brake as Dogs Home Secretary\n Don Crown as Busker\n Michael Graham Cox as Park Keeper\n Bruce Purchase as Policeman\n Pat Ashton as Woman at Nursery\n Keith Chegwin as Georgie (uncredited)\n Hilary Pritchard as Laundry lady (uncredited)\n\nNovel and screenplay\nSimmons is said to have planned the film around the time his two award-winning short films Sunday By the Sea (1953) and Bow Bells (1954) were released. Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works.  Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964.\n\nCritical reception\nVariety wrote, \"It all sounds like goo, and the film’s last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\" while The New York Times described the film as \"the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker. And commendably, he submerges himself sufficiently in the part to allow old Sam to have a life of his own.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1974 films\nBritish films\nBritish drama films\n1973 drama films\n1973 films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms directed by Anthony Simmons\nFilms based on British novels\nFilms scored by George Martin\nFilms set in London\n1974 drama films\nNine Elms", "machine_text": "The Optimists of Nine Elms is a 1973 British drama film directed by Anthony Simmons and starring Peter Sellers, Donna Mullane and John Chaffey.

He is perhaps best known for being one of the earliest photographers, if not the first photographer, to enter and photograph what is now Yosemite National Park.\n\nIn 1854, during the California Gold Rush, Weed moved to Sacramento, California, and was a camera operator in the daguerreotype portrait studio of George J. Watson.  In 1855, Weed adopted the wet collodion technique, and his photographs of Gold Rush miners and settlement were much admired.\n\nEntrepreneur James Hutchings and others ventured into the area of what is now known as Yosemite Valley in 1855, becoming the Valley's first tourists. After returning to Mariposa Hutchings wrote an article about his experience which appeared in the August 9, 1855 issue of the Mariposa Gazette and was later published in various forms nationally.\n\nHutchings brought Weed to the Valley in the summer of 1859. Weed took the first known photographs of the Valley's features, and a September exhibition in San Francisco presented them to the public. Hutchings published four installments of \"The Great Yo-semite Valley\" from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine; these articles contained woodcuts based on Weed's photographs. A book by Hutchings titled Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California collected these articles and the book stayed in print well into the 1870s.\n\nBeginning in 1860, Weed started extensive traveling, including trips to Hong Kong (where he briefly established a studio), Hawaii, and the Far East (in 1867). Also in 1867, he presented his work at the Paris Exposition Universelle, where he won an award for landscape photography.\n\nIn 1872, Weed made another visit to Yosemite, probably in the company of well-known Yosemite photographer Eadweard Muybridge.

Upon graduation, Weed moved to Denver, Colorado, where he worked as a draftsman for several architectural firms. In 1886, he established his own practice, which quickly gained a reputation for designing commercial and public buildings. One of Weed's most notable projects was the Colorado State Capitol building, which he designed in collaboration with architect Elijah E. Myers. The building, which features a distinctive dome and Beaux-Arts style architecture, was completed in 1908 and still stands as a symbol of Colorado's rich history. Weed also designed several other prominent buildings in Denver, including the Oxford Hotel, the Denver Athletic Club, and the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.

Its body and dorsal forewings are a deep green color. The dorsal hindwings have purple-blue patches, yellow borders, and a red spot near the inner margin. The underside is yellow green and gray purple. Like most moths in the family Sphingidae, caterpillars pupate in burrows. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.\n\nDistribution\nIt is found from Argentina north through Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies to Florida, Mississippi, South Texas, Arizona, and Colombia. Occasionally winds carry them to other places, such as Missouri, southern Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maine, and southern Saskatchewan.\n\nLife cycle\nFemale adults lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plant, mainly grapes (Vitis), and vine (Cissus). Caterpillars hatch and start eating, resembling the head of a snake. When they are ready to pupate, they climb down their host plant and burrow underground. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone odor plume. Adults probably feed on flower nectar.\n\nSubspecies\nEumorpha labruscae labruscae\nEumorpha labruscae yupanquii (Kernbach, 1962) (Galápagos Islands)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSpecies description\nTwo pictures\n\nEumorpha\nMoths described in 1758\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus\nMoths of North America\nSphingidae of South America\nMoths of South America", "machine_text": "Eumorpha labruscae is a species of moth in the family Sphingidae, commonly known as the vine hawkmoth. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, from Mexico south to Argentina. The species was first described by the German entomologist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz in 1821. The vine hawkmoth is a large and distinctive moth, with a wingspan ranging from 80 to 120 mm. Its forewings are brown or greyish-brown with darker markings, and the hindwings are a striking pink or reddish color. The moth's body is also reddish, and it has a long, flexible proboscis that it uses to feed on nectar from flowers. The larvae of E. labruscae are green or brown, with a distinct white line along the side of the body. They feed on the leaves of various plants, including vine species such as grape and passionfruit. The caterpillars have a unique adaptation in the form of a horn-like protuberance on their posterior end, which they use to defend themselves against predators. The vine hawkmoth is an important pollinator of many plant species, as well as a food source for animals such as birds and bats. It is also an important cultural symbol in some regions, with indigenous peoples in Brazil and Bolivia using the moth's image in their artwork and myths. Like many species of moth, E. labruscae faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as from pesticides and other forms of pollution. However, it is not considered to be in significant danger of extinction. Overall, the vine hawkmoth is a fascinating and important species that is widely appreciated by entomologists, nature enthusiasts, and indigenous cultures alike.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4360386}

He set the world record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.2 seconds in 1961, breaking the record that had been set by Mel Patton in 1948.\n\nEarly life \nBudd was born in Long Branch, New Jersey.  He played high school football at Asbury Park High School in Asbury Park.\n\nHe ran track at Villanova University but never played a down of college football. At Villanova he was coached by their legendary track coach James 'Jumbo' Elliott.\n\nAmazingly. Budd achieved his success despite a deformed right calf, the legacy of a childhood disease, possibly polio.\n\nTrack career \n\nBudd was considered the world's best 100 y/m sprinter in 1961. That year, he was to equal the world record for 100 y at 9.3 s, set a new world record at 9.2 s for that distance, and was a member of a team that set a world record in the 4 × 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s.\n\n1960 Rome Olympics \n\nBudd had finished second behind Ray Norton in the United States Olympic trials at 100 m in a closely fought contest between the first four finishers, all recording the same time of 10.4 s. At the Olympics themselves, Budd was to finish fifth in the final with perhaps his inexperience at major championships telling against him.\n\nBudd was to experience further disappointment in the 4 × 100 m relay. The United States team (of Budd-Norton-Stone Johnson-Dave Sime) finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because the at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. The West German team who finished second in 39.5 s received the gold medals and became the new world record holders.\n\nWorld records \n\nIn 1961, Budd was to equal twice the then world record for 100 y of 9.3 s:\n\n on 6 May in Villanova;\n on June 11 in Villanova (Note: this time was never ratified.)\n\nThis record had stood since 1948 having first been set by Mel Patton and subsequently equaled by 12 other athletes.\n\nThen on June 24, 1961, Budd became the first man to run the 100 y in 9.2 s. He was competing in the AAU Championships at Downing Stadium in New York City.\n\nOn July 15, 1961, in a dual USA-USSR meet, Budd was a member of team that set a new world record for the 4 × 100 m relay of 39.1 s.\n\nThe next year, 1962, he equaled the world record for 200 m/220 y on a straight track of 20.0 s. It is claimed that Budd, feeing a twinge in a muscle, was easing-up the last 70 m.\n\nRankings \n\nBudd was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events during the period 1960–62, according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.\n\nUSA Championships \nBudd achieved notable success at the AAU championships, the USA national championships.\n\nAmerican football career \n\nBudd was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 1962 NFL Draft and played for the Eagles in 1962 as a wide receiver. He played for the Washington Redskins in 1963 before switching to the Canadian Football League, where he played for the Calgary Stampeders in 1965 and 1966.\n\nBudd had both sporting and financial reasons for giving up the chance of further glory on the track for the possibility of glory and wealth on the football field; as his wife, Barbera, has stated, \"...you've got to remember that Frank loved football, too,....He didn't think it was a mistake at all. There was no money available then in track.  He'd been a terrific player at Asbury Park, and he thought, with all his speed (despite no college football experience), he'd have a long career in the NFL.\".\n\nHonors \nIn 1995, Budd was one of the seven former Villanova athletes chosen to be a member of the first induction class of the Villanova Wall of Fame.\n\nLater life \n\nBudd has been reported to have worked in later life for the New Jersey Department of Corrections and retired in 2002.\n\nA resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Budd died on April 29, 2014, in the Marlton section of Evesham Township, New Jersey.

To do this, Dallara worked to reduce the weight of the chassis as much as possible, allowing Haas more freedom in using ballast to influence the car's weight distribution.\n\nThe car was subject to scrutiny following its performances in pre-season testing and free practice sessions at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix.

It was awarded BPI Silver Certification on 19 July 1977.\n\nRecording sessions with its producer and orchestral arranger Rupert Holmes started in the summer of 1976 in the United States when Miles was promoting his first album Rebel. The bulk of the album was recorded in England.\nFor this album, Miles recruited Australian keyboardist Gary Moberley because Miles felt that his previous album was missing something funky.\nBoth \"Remember Yesterday\" and \"Slow Down\" charted in the UK (respectively 32 and 10) and would be the last Miles singles to chart in Britain until 1983. Although the singles did fairly well, the album itself barely cracked the top 40 of the UK chart and reaching No. 82 in Canada. However, the cut \"Slow Down\" proved to be Miles' biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Disco chart, No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977, but just No. 68 in Canada. \n\"Remember Yesterday\" was written about Bob Marshall, who was according to Miles a very romantic type, because he drifted around from girl to girl. \nA track of the title song had been recorded during the sessions of Rebel and was originally planned to be released as the B-side of \"Highfly\", but was shelved. It was orchestrated by Holmes who added percussion in New York performed by recording legend Jimmy Maelen.\n\"Manhattan Skyline\" was written about the first impressions Miles and Marshall had of New York and was recorded entirely in Manhattan. In 1977, singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester covered the Miles-Marshall ballad \"Time,\" which on Stranger in the City was performed solely by Miles at the piano, accompanied by strings and brass.\n\nIn 2007, the album was rereleased and remastered with several bonus tracks.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks written by Bob Marshall and John Miles except where noted \n\"Stranger in the City\" 4:30\n\"Slow Down\" 4:46\n\"Stand up (And Give Me a Reason)\" 7:03\n\"Time\" 3:57\n\"Manhattan Skyline\" 3:06\n\"Glamour Boy\" 4:49\n\"Do it Anyway\" (Barry Black)  2:46\n\"Remember Yesterday\"  5:23\n\"Music Man\" 4:53\n\"House On The Hill\" 4:21 (On 1989 CD release only) \n\"Man Behind The Guitar\" 4:03 (On 1989 CD release only) \n\"Putting My New Song Together\" 4:21 (On 1989 CD release only) \n\"Sweet Lorraine\" 3:02 (On 1989 CD release only) \n\nBonus tracks on reissue\n\n\"House on the Hill\" (B-side of \"Remember Yesterday\") 4:19\n\"Slow Down\" 4:14\n\"Stand Up (And Give me a Reason)\" 3:45\n\"Remember Yesterday\" 3:18\n\nPersonnel\nJohn Miles – vocals, piano, guitar\nBob Marshall – bass guitar\nBarry Black – drums\nGary Moberley – keyboards\nJimmy Maelen – conga, Latin percussion\nRupert Holmes – producer, orchestral arrangements, conductor\nTechnical\nBob Clearmountain, James Guthrie, Mike Bobak - engineer\nGodfrey Diamond - mixing\nHipgnosis - design, photography\n\nReferences\n\n1977 albums\nJohn Miles (musician) albums\nLondon Records albums\nAlbums with cover art by Hipgnosis", "machine_text": "Stranger in the City is a phrase that has been used in popular culture to describe the feeling of being lost or out of place in unfamiliar surroundings. The term can refer to both literal and metaphorical contexts, ranging from an actual newcomer in a big city to someone who feels disconnected from their own environment. In the literal sense, Stranger in the City can represent a common experience for anyone who has recently moved to a new place, particularly if that place is vastly different from their previous home. The idea of a newcomer trying to navigate the streets, subway systems, and local customs of a bustling metropolis has been the subject of countless books and movies, from New York to Tokyo. Metaphorically, the concept of \"stranger in the city\" can also describe a sense of dislocation or alienation that arises from feeling disconnected from one's own community or societal norms. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as experiencing culture shock upon return from a foreign country, or feeling excluded due to differences in race, gender, or sexual orientation. The phrase has been used in various artistic contexts, including songs, films, and literature. For example, the song \"Strangers in the Night\" by Frank Sinatra tells the story of two people who meet in a city and fall in love, while the film \"Lost in Translation\" explores the experiences of two Americans trying to navigate Tokyo's unfamiliar culture. Overall, the term Stranger in the City has become a popular phrase that captures the complex emotions of navigating new environments and feeling disconnected from one's own surroundings.

Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where \"decisions\" will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.\n\nThe game incorporates many new and returning elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. \"Hunter Sense\" returns, and now upon finding evidence, the player creates a flashback in the form of a black-and-white moving image of the animal's last known location and what that animal was doing. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player, such as animals now having some of the most improved and most realistic AI in any game, meaning they could easily see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can now randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, so the player's \"killer instinct\" slow-motion mode activates, turning the player towards the animal to shoot before it lands a hit. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations) to avoid females, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals are calm and can't detect you, medium-pitched beeps indicate that animals are starting to detect your presence, and high-pitched beeps tell the player that animals have clearly spotted the player and they are about to run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force that could disturb the animals appears and the player must kill the target in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain number of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.\n\nThe game also features multiplayer where players can create or customize their own map from a template (based on campaign or gallery) or from scratch. Players can place trees, foliage, water, terrain formations, and animals found in the game or create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends with online connectivity. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped bolt-action hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, target, which you can use to practice your marksmanship by shooting wood cutouts of animal targets, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game was released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.\n\nStory\nTwenty-five-year-old John Sharp, a rookie big game hunter, is invited to participate in the Cabela's 2012 International Safari hosted by John Hathcock, a high-ranking member of the Order of Orion, an elite club of world-class big game hunters from all over the world. The player starts in Montana, Sharp's homeland, where he hunts red deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, and hunt an elk before wolves scare it away. The next day a wounded mountain lion terrorizes the area, and Sharp must kill it. The player heads to Mexico, where he hunts whitetail, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer. After taking shelter in an arroyo during a sandstorm, Sharp finds boot tracks, confident that someone trespassed into his zone. Just as he's approaching a bison herd, a rifle fires and misses, scaring them off. It's revealed Matisse fired, trying to make Sharp miss his chance. The two argue, but Hathcock shames them.\n\nThen the player goes to Hathcock's private ranch in Texas, hunting white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, wild boar, bison, and moose. The radio gets a distress call from Freidkin, with Hathcock telling Sharp to check it out. Sharp finds that Freidkin's stand was knocked over by a startled bison, making him fall 70 feet down into a gorge. Sharp must then defend him from meat-craving boars until medical assistance arrives. Freidkin is taken to a hospital, where his left leg is amputated, making him drop out. The player goes to Namibia, where he hunts blackbuck, impala, zebra, wildebeest, greater kudu, White rhino and Cape buffalo. Sharp comes across lion tracks, confirming that a hunting pride is scouring the area. Sharp hears as Cassidy alerts everyone that he and his kill are surrounded by lions. As Cassidy starts to panic, Sharp instructs him to abandon his trophy and jump into a nearby ravine. There are several roars and a scream as several birds are flushed from the trees. Sharp runs to the site, finding nothing but Cassidy's rifle and pack with smears of blood. Sharp sees the male lion in the distance, and must dispatch the lionesses. He's then ambushed by the lion, and as he's about to kill Sharp a shot fires, and the lion pauses and falls to his side. Sharp sits up and sees Matisse, revealing he shot the lion for himself, saving his life. Authorities scour the area, but Cassidy's body is never found.\n\nThe player and Matisse finally go to Kodiak Island in Alaska, the final location as an approaching Arctic blizzard threatens the cancel the tournament. Meanwhile, a man-eating grizzly bear named Bloody Ben has been terrorizing the island for the last decade, and poses a huge threat to the hunters, spectators, and game animals in the area. The player hunts red deer, Sitka deer, elk, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In the midst of the blizzard, Sharp finally finds Ben's tracks, and just as he's about to shoot, a man jumps in front of his scope, revealed to be Matisse. He aggravates the bear by shooting twice, but is mauled. Sharp runs to Matisse, badly injured and passed out. Sharp is then startled by the bear, and jumps to the ground for his rifle as Bloody Ben closes in for the kill. Sharp kills Ben after shooting him 6 times in his vitals. Matisse wakes up, only to see Sharp looking at him with a confident smirk and Bloody Ben dead behind him. Matisse admits defeat to Sharp and apologizes for everything he's done. Sharp then sells Ben's skin to the Order, and he uses the money to go to Hawaii the next summer. The game ends.\n\nTrivia \nThe Cape buffalo is misidentified as a water buffalo, and the trophy score one has four horns in the photo.\nThe golden eagle is the only small game animal that will give you a penalty if shot at.\nThis game is the first appearance of the gray wolf, bison, wild boar, zebra and wildebeest in the Big Game Hunter series.\nThis is the only Cabela's game to feature the UTD.\nThis is the last Big Game Hunter series game released on the Wii.\nAll international versions of the game were localized in Activision's Dublin office.\n\n2011 video games\nCabela's video games\nHunting video games\nVideo games developed in Slovakia\nPlayStation 3 games\nWii games\nXbox 360 games\nVideo games set in Africa\nVideo games set in North America", "machine_text": "Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 is a hunting simulation video game developed by Cauldron and published by Activision and Cabela's for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2011.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Native Dancer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Native Dancer (March 27, 1950 – November 16, 1967), nicknamed the Gray Ghost, was one of the most celebrated and accomplished Thoroughbred racehorses in American history and was the first horse made famous through the medium of television. He was a champion in each of his three years of racing, and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, he was ranked seventh.\n\nAs a two-year-old, he was undefeated in his nine starts and was voted Horse of the Year in two of three major industry polls – One Count won the other. At age three, he suffered the sole defeat in his career in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, but rebounded to win the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes. He made only three starts at age four before being retired due to injury, but was still named American Horse of the Year.\n\nRetired to stud in 1955, he became a major sire whose offspring included champion Raise A Native and dual Classic winner Kauai King. Also an influential broodmare sire, Native Dancer is now \"all but universal\" in modern pedigrees.\n\nBackground\nNative Dancer was bred by Alfred G. Vanderbilt Jr. and raced for him as a homebred. He was foaled at Scott Farm near Lexington, Kentucky but was raised at Vanderbilt's Sagamore Farm in Glyndon, Maryland, and is generally considered a Maryland-bred. Native Dancer was sired by the 1945 Preakness Stakes winner, Polynesian, who was otherwise known as a sprinter. His dam Geisha won only once in her eleven starts and produced no other stakes winners, though her daughter Orientation became a multiple stakes producer. Geisha was sired by Discovery, an outstanding distance horse and weight-carrier. Discovery was also the broodmare sire of leading sire Bold Ruler.\n\nNative Dancer inherited his gray coat, then quite rare in Thoroughbreds, through the female line to his fourth dam, La Grisette, a daughter of Roi Herode. Roi Herode was also the sire of The Tetrarch, the \"spotted wonder\". Most modern gray Thoroughbreds can trace their coat to Roi Herode and his grandsire Le Sancy.\n\nFrom his earliest days, Native Dancer was considered \"an extremely nice colt\". Ralph Kerchaval, the manager of Sagamore Farm, said that \"he was playful, big and rough, but you could do anything with him.\" At maturity, Native Dancer stood  at the withers. According to Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form, Native Dancer looked like a sprinter from the front and a stayer from the back. He was a massive horse with \"suspicious-looking ankles\". His pastern bones were short and somewhat too upright, making him more vulnerable to injury. He had a notably long stride but his action was hard and pounding. Trainer Bill Winfrey said the colt was \"a regular Jekyll and Hyde\" – ordinarily quiet and tractable but with a playful streak that could make him a handful.\n\nRacing record\n\n1952: two-year-old campaign\nIn his first season of racing, Native Dancer won all nine starts. He was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1952, with two of the three major polls also naming him Horse of the Year.\n\nNative Dancer made his first start on April 19, 1952 in a maiden race at Jamaica Racetrack over five furlongs. Going off at odds of 7-5 in a field of nine, he settled into fourth place down the backstretch, then started a strong drive in the middle of the turn to win by  lengths. Just four days later, he returned in the Youthful Stakes where he was made the odds-on favorite in a field of twelve. He pressed a fast early pace set by Retrouve then pulled away in the stretch to win by six lengths. The victory established the colt as the early leader of the two-year-old division.\n\nNative Dancer was then given a layoff to recover from sore shins. He returned to racing on the opening day of Saratoga Race Course, August 4, in the Flash Stakes over  furlongs. Again the odds-on favorite, he was ridden hard around the turn before drawing away in the stretch to win by  lengths. On August 16, he entered the Saratoga Special, noteworthy at the time for having a winner-takes-all purse of $17,000. He won by  lengths over a muddy track. He followed up by winning the Grand Union Hotel Stakes on August 23, defeating two previously undefeated colts – Tahitian King and Lafango. He won by  lengths while running the fastest six furlongs at that year's Saratoga meeting, 1:11. He completed his dominance at Saratoga by winning the Hopeful Stakes on the meeting's closing day, August 31. Jockey Eric Guerin said, \"I never had a second of worry. He took off when I asked him to.\"\n\nNative Dancer made his next start on September 22 at Belmont Park in a six-furlong special weight race. He broke in fifth place in the field of six, then steadily improved his position to win by  lengths. Just five days later, he returned in the Belmont Futurity, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the United States. He turned in a \"superlative performance\" to win while tying the world record for  furlongs, 1:14. He had been hard pressed though: Guerin admitted that he had thought the colt was beaten with an eighth of a mile remaining when he was headed by Tahitian King. But Native Dancer responded in the final furlong to open a  lead advantage. He became the first gray horse to win the race.\n\nNative Dancer made his final start as a two-year-old in the East View Stakes at Jamaica on October 22 over a distance of  miles. He won with ease, \"wiggling his ears and having much fun\" as he crossed the finish line  lengths ahead of Laffango, who had earlier won the Champagne Stakes. Guerin confirmed that Native Dancer had eased himself after taking the lead at the head of the stretch. \"He's not going to do any more than you make him do,\" he said. \"I never hit him with the whip.\"\n\nNative Dancer finished the year with nine wins, seven of them in stakes races, and earnings of $230,245, then a record for a two-year-old. He had been the odds-on favorite in all but his first start. He was named the American Champion Two-Year-Old. The Thoroughbred Racing Association also named him the American Horse of the Year, a \"break with tradition\" as two-year-olds are not normally considered for the award since they typically only race against horses of the same age. The Turf and Sports Digest, polling 176 sportswriters, also awarded him Horse of the Year honors However, the Daily Racing Form voted instead for One Count, winner of the Belmont and Jockey Club Gold Cup.\n\nHe was assigned 130 pounds in the Experimental Free Handicap, seven pounds ahead of Laffango and Tahitian King.\n\n1953: three-year-old campaign\nIn his three-year-old campaign, Native Dancer received a great deal of media attention leading up to the 1953 Kentucky Derby. He won the Gotham Stakes and the prestigious Wood Memorial, but in the 1953 Kentucky Derby, he lost for the only time in his career. Native Dancer subsequently won the Preakness, Belmont and Travers Stakes, a feat accomplished until then only by Duke of Magenta, Grenada, Man o' War and Whirlaway. Native Dancer finished the season with nine wins (all of them stakes races) from ten starts and was named Champion Three-Year-Old Colt.\n\nPreparing for the Triple Crown\nNative Dancer was given some time off at the end of his two-year-old campaign, then resumed training in California at Santa Anita Racetrack. He gave his connections a scare in late January when he threw his exercise rider after stumbling to his knees following a workout. He then bolted and was loose for five minutes, running into the paddock where he jumped some benches and ran through flower beds. When he tangled a leg in the reins, he finally slowed down enough to be recaptured. No serious damage was done.\n\nHe was shipped to New York in mid-March and made his first start of the year in the Gotham Stakes on April 18. As the race attracted 18 entries, it was run in two divisions, with Native Dancer the odds-on favorite is his division and Laffango the favorite in the second division. He raced in mid-pack during the early part of the race, then \"did a bit of hustling\" turning into the stretch to take the lead. He won under a hand ride by two lengths. Sportswriter George Ryall wrote, \"Any question in your mind about Native Dancer is easy to answer; he's as good as you thought.\"\n\nNative Dancer extended his winning streak to eleven in the Wood Memorial on April 25. Going off as the 1-10 favorite, he was restrained until the top of the stretch, then \"whizzed away\" from his rivals to win by  lengths over Tahitian King.\n\nThe Gotham and Wood Memorial were both televised by NBC. Native Dancer's gray coat helped him stand out on the black and white screens of the day, helping him to become the first TV star of the sport.\n\nKentucky Derby\nThe 1953 Kentucky Derby, held on May 2, was the sole loss of Native Dancer's career. He dominated news coverage leading up to the race and was the odds-on favorite. His main rival was supposed to have been Correspondent, who had won three straight, including the Blue Grass Stakes in which he set a track record. Dark Star won the Derby Trial a few days before the Derby but was largely dismissed by the bettors at odds of 25-1.\n\nDark Star, starting from the next-to-outside post position, went to the early lead and moved over to the rail. Native Dancer was eighth as they went down the stretch for the first time and was then bumped by longshot Money Maker as they entered the first turn. He started to make up ground on the final turn while racing wide, then was moved to the inside as he entered the stretch in third place. Still nearly three lengths behind, Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer gradually closed ground. Dark Star held his position on the rail so Native Dancer was swung to the outside. He continued to edge closer with each stride but fell just short, losing by a head.\n\nIn addition to Native Dancer being fouled on the first turn, Guerin commented after the race that the colt had not cared for the track. However, Guerin was given a large share of the blame for the loss because of his racing tactics. One reporter wrote, \"he took that colt everywhere on the track except the ladies' room.\" Native Dancer was farther back than usual in the early part of the race, which resulted in more traffic problems. Instead of mounting a single drive on the outside, Guerin changed position several times in the final quarter of a mile, costing the colt momentum. Guerin later explained, \"He just didn't want to run early. And when he didn't want to run, he didn't run.\"\n\nTime magazine later reported, \"When he lost the Kentucky Derby by a head, thousands turned from their TV screens in sorrow, a few in tears.\" As a measure of Native Dancer's growing fame, Time added, \"Hundreds of people, old and young, have sent him letters and greeting cards. Little girls have organized fan clubs in his name.\"\n\nNative Dancer made his next start in the Withers Stakes on May 16 at Belmont Park. Facing only two other horses, he went off as the 1-20 favorite (the legal minimum) with win-only betting allowed. Native Dancer stumbled when leaving the starting gate but quickly recovered. He took a narrow lead about three furlongs from the finish and opened a significant margin around the eighth pole when Guerin flicked his whip. The final margin was four lengths.\n\nPreakness Stakes\nOn May 23, Native Dancer entered the Preakness Stakes as the 1-5 favorite. He again faced Dark Star, who set a fast early pace with Tahitian King to his outside. Native Dancer rated in fourth position on the rail, then started his move on the final turn, splitting between the two front runners. Tahitian King dropped back and eventually finished sixth. At the head of the stretch, Dark Star also gave way, leaving Native Dancer alone on the lead. However, longshot Jamie K then started to close ground rapidly. Guerin went to the whip and Native Dancer responded to win by a neck. Guerin admitted that he had been worried. \"When Dark Star stopped, I found myself in the lead a little sooner than I wanted,\" he said. It was later determined that Dark Star had bowed a tendon during the race: he never raced again.\n\nBesides being the odds-on favorite to win, Native Dancer was so heavily bet to show that it created a minus pool. A show bet pays if the horse finishes in the top three positions, and the legal minimum payout in Maryland at the time was $2.20 for a $2 bet. In order to cover the bets plus the associated taxes, the Maryland Jockey Club had to pay $46,012 () into the pool.\n\nThe trophy for the Preakness is the Woodlawn Vase, considered the most valuable trophy in sports with a value of roughly $4 million. Before 1954, the vase itself was given to the winning owner, who kept it for the following year. In 1954 though, Vanderbilt declined to take the original trophy home and instead was given a replica. This set a new tradition where the original Woodlawn Vase is displayed at Pimlico on Preakness day but otherwise resides at the Baltimore Museum of Art. Vanderbilt's replica trophy was sold at auction in 2018 for $100,000.\n\nBelmont Stakes\nNative Dancer was shipped to Belmont Park on May 24. He was walked the next two days to recover from the Preakness, then resumed galloping in the morning. He had several timed workouts in the interval leading up to the Belmont:  mile in 1:04 on May 30, a mile in 1:44 on June 1,  mile in 0:35 on June 4,  miles in 2:07 on June 5,  miles in 2:38 on June 9, and  mile in 1:13 on June 12. Training practices have since changed dramatically. For example, California Chrome had only one timed workout in the three weeks between the 2014 Preakness and Belmont.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes, run on June 13, was a similar race to the Preakness. Native Dancer was again the heavy favorite, and the New York Racing Association did not allow show betting. Ram o' War set the early pace with Native Dancer biding his time in fourth place around the first turn. He was tracked closely by Jamie K and the two horses started their move together on the final turn. Jamie K briefly took the lead as they entered the stretch, but Native Dancer fought back. The two colts dueled for the final furlong, with Native Dancer again prevailing by a neck. He completed the  miles in 2:28, then the third-fastest running of the race behind Count Fleet and Citation.\n\n\"He doesn't win in a flashy sort of a way,\" said Winfrey, \"but he keeps on winning. The Belmont is supposed to be 'the test of the champion' and if it is, he certainly answered the question.\"\n\nTo date, Native Dancer is one of only two \"dual Classic winners\" to come from the state of Maryland (the other being his son Kauai King, who won the 1966 Kentucky Derby and Preakness).\n\nSummer campaign\nWinfrey planned a busy summer campaign to keep his \"lazy so-and-so\" active. Native Dancer responded to the challenge, winning the Dwyer, Arlington Classic, Travers and American Derby in quick succession. On July 4, he went off as the 1-20 favorite in the Dwyer Stakes. He took the lead near the head of the stretch, \"loafed for a while, exerted himself just a bit in the final yards,\" and won by  lengths. Carrying 126 pounds, he conceded 10 pounds to each of his four rivals. Even though win-only betting was allowed, Native Dancer still created a small minus pool with a mandatory minimum payout of $2.10 for a $2 bet.\n\nNative Dancer then traveled to Chicago for the Arlington Classic, run over a distance of a mile on a heavy track on July 18. His main rivals were expected to be Jamie K and Van Crosby, who had equaled the track record for seven furlongs in his previous start. Native Dancer carried 128 pounds, conceding six pounds to each of his seven rivals. As expected, Van Crosby set the pace, but was run down by Native Dancer turning into the stretch. Native Dancer continued to draw away and won by nine lengths, the biggest margin of victory of his career. Longshot Sir Mango closed late for second; Jamie K was never a factor.\n\nOn August 15, Native Dancer made his next start in the prestigious Travers Stakes at Saratoga. He conceded six pounds to Dictar and twelve to the other three entrants. In the walking ring, he was surrounded by a throng of fans looking for photographs. \"It's the way people act when the president goes by in a parade,\" commented one man. Native Dancer maintained his calm. At the break, Fly Wheel took the early lead but soon dropped back. Guardian II then took over the lead for a few lengths before Dictar took command on the backstretch. Native Dancer bided his time until the  pole, then powered away to win by  lengths ahead of Dictar. Native Dancer again created minus pools in the win and place betting – show betting was not allowed.\n\nGuerin was suspended for an incident in another race and so missed Native Dancer's next start, the American Derby on August 22. Eddie Arcaro got the mount after the horse he had been scheduled to ride, Jamie K, was withdrawn from the race. Arcaro had previously questioned Native Dancer's credentials, saying, \"All the Dancer has done is go around beating the same horses, and most of the time carrying equal weight.\" He had also questioned the horse's soundness. After galloping him for the first time though, he said, \"He's a big, powerful animal. He handled well and had a good disposition.\"\n\nTravelling back to Chicago, Native Dancer went off as the 1-10 favorite in a field of eight in the American Derby on August 22. He settled near the back of the pack behind a fast early pace set by Sir Mango. Entering the far turn, Native Dancer moved to the outside and into fourth place. Without any urging, he surged forward rounding the far turn and won by two lengths. He completed the -mile race in 1:48, just one-fifth of a second off the track record. Arcaro believed that the colt could have broken the record if urged. \"But he was winning, so I didn't see any point in pressing him,\" he said. \"I let him run his own race.\" Despite the easy win, Arcaro still believed that Native Dancer had something to prove. He rated Citation as the best horse he had ever ridden.\n\nWhile Native Dancer was having a noteworthy campaign in the three-year-old division, Tom Fool was enjoying an equally brilliant one as a four-year-old. Racetracks began to alter stakes schedules and purses in hopes of having the two champions face off. For example, Pimlico increased the purse for the Pimlico Special to $50,000. Belmont Park followed suit by increasing the purse and changing the date of the Sysonby Stakes. The hopes for a race between the two died when several bruises were found on Native Dancer's left forefoot after the American Derby. He missed the rest of the year.\n\nNative Dancer was named champion three-year-old by all three major industry polls. However, in the Horse of the Year voting, he came second behind Tom Fool, who had won all ten of his starts.\n\n1954: four-year-old campaign\nIn 1954, Native Dancer won all three races he entered, including the Metropolitan Handicap. His connections hoped to complete the New York Handicap Triple, or perhaps race in Europe on the turf. However, Native Dancer was retired as a result of a recurring foot injury with a record of 21 wins out of 22 lifetime races.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1954, Native Dancer was in Maryland where he spent the winter at Sagamore Farm. By February, he was galloping three miles a day. He was then was shipped to New York in late March to resume training with Winfrey. He now faced a new challenge: as an older horse, he would be expected to carry high weight imposts in the handicap format pervasive at the time. His connections considered sending him to England to compete in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes if the weights got too high. Vanderbilt also discussed entering the colt in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France.\n\nNative Dancer made his first start of the year in a six-furlong allowance race at Belmont Park on May 7. He went off at odds of 3-20 in a seven-horse field, with Laffango the second choice at 7-1. He raced in mid-pack for the first half-mile, then \"took the lead in about three huge strides.\" After hitting the front near the top of the stretch, Native Dancer relaxed but still won by  lengths.\n\nOn May 15, Native Dancer entered the Metropolitan Handicap, in which he was assigned 130 pounds – from 13 to 24 pounds more than his eight rivals. He raced further back than usual, trailing by ten lengths with a half mile remaining and still seven lengths back at the quarter pole. Down the stretch, Guerin hit him four times with the whip. Native Dancer \"answered the question\" and lengthened his stride. He closed steadily, getting his nose in front with just 30 yards remaining. He completed the mile in 1:35, then the second-fastest running of the race in its history.\n\nNative Dancer was supposed to make his next start in the Suburban Handicap, then part of the New York Handicap Triple (consisting of the Metropolitan, Suburban and Brooklyn Handicaps). However, after a workout in late May, he showed signs of lameness. Heating was found in the coronet band on his right fore, though X-rays showed nothing. Winfrey originally gave the colt a 50% chance of being fit for the Suburban. Native Dancer worked three furlongs on May 27 but pulled up lame. His connections ruled him out of the Suburban.\n\nNative Dancer finally returned to racing at Saratoga on August 16 in the Oneonta Handicap, run at a distance of seven furlongs over a sloppy track. He was assigned 137 pounds, conceding his rivals from 18 to 30 pounds. Even with the handicap, only two horses faced him so betting was not allowed. He won easily by nine lengths in 1:24, just  seconds off the track record despite the track conditions.\n\nHis next target was the Saratoga Cup but he showed signs of lameness after a 10-furlong workout on August 22, again in the right forefoot. Veterinarian William Wright diagnosed the problem as a \"bruised digital cushion, with a secondary inflammation of the bursae between the navicular and coffin bone.\" He was retired with a record of 21 wins from 22 starts, and earnings of $785,420, then fourth all-time behind Citation, Stymie and Armed.\n\nNative Dancer was voted the United States Horse of the Year for 1954, beating High Gun by 19 votes to 11 in the Daily Racing Form poll and winning the TRA award for the second time. He appeared on the May 31 cover of Time magazine. Many consider the \"Gray Ghost of Sagamore\" to have been the first Thoroughbred television star and TV Guide ranked him as a top icon of the era\".\n\nStatistics\n\nStud record\nAt stud, Native Dancer sired 43 stakes winners (or 44 according to one source) from 306 foals. His male-line descendants, particularly through his grandson Mr. Prospector, have dominated the US Triple Crown races. He is also the damsire of Northern Dancer, arguably the most influential stallion of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough Native Dancer never led the American sire list, he did finish second in 1966 and sixth in 1965. He was also second in the English sire list of 1963, and seventh in the French sire list of 1963.\n\nAmong Native Dancer's notable offspring are:\n Atan - sire of major sire Sharpen Up\n Dan Cupid – won Prix du Bois and other stakes races in France; sire of Sea-Bird (won Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe)\n Dancer's Image - won 1968 Kentucky Derby (disqualified)\n Exclusive Dancer - stakes winner and dam of General Assembly\n Gala Performance - won Jim Dandy Stakes: sire of steeplechasers, including West Tip, the winner of the 1986 Aintree Grand National and Monksfield.\n Good Move - won Selima Stakes etc.\n Hula Dancer - raced in France and England where her wins included the 1,000 Guineas\n Kauai King - won the 1966 Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes\n Natalma - dam of Northern Dancer\n Native Charger - won the 1965 Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby\n Native Prince – won Great American Stakes etc.\n Native Street - multiple stakes wins including the 1966 Kentucky Oaks\n Protanto - multiple stakes wins including the 1971 Whitney Stakes\n Raise a Native - co-champion two-year-old colt of 1963. important sire of Majestic Prince, Alydar and leading sire Mr. Prospector, as well as Exclusive Native, who sired Affirmed and Genuine Risk\n Secret Step – won King George Stakes and July Cup etc. in England\n Shenanigans - 1975 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Dam of the champion filly Ruffian and influential sire Icecapade\n Street Dancer won Santa Ana Handicap etc.\n\nNative Dancer's bloodline is credited with creating \"precocious, speedy Thoroughbreds that dominate the Derby and other Triple Crown events.\" By 2008, every entrant in the Kentucky Derby was a descendant. However, he is also faulted for passing on his massive build and hard-pounding stride action, rendering many of his descendants vulnerable to injury. In the mid-2000s, there had been a troubling number of high profile breakdowns, including that of Barbaro (who was distantly related to Native Dancer through his dam.) As the grandsire of both Mr. Prospector and Northern Dancer, the two most important sires of the late twentieth century, a certain degree of inbreeding to Native Dancer became inevitable, potentially exacerbating the issue. \"There's a lack of durability right now,\" said Ric Waldman, the former head of operations for Windfields Farm. \"We're dealing with the law of diminishing returns.\" Vanderbilt's son Alfred G. Vanderbilt defended the stallion's legacy. \"All these great horses are not descended from him because he's fragile,\" he said. \"They're descended because he was a champion and he was durable.\"\n\nNative Dancer died on November 16, 1967, following the surgical removal of a tumor on the wall of the small intestine. He was buried at Sagamore Farm.\n\nHonors\n\nNative Dancer was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. He was inducted into the Maryland State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nIn the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Native Dancer was ranked #7. In the Associated Press rankings of the greatest racehorses of the 20th century, he was ranked #3, tied with Citation, behind only Man o' War and Secretariat.\n\nIn August 2015, a statue of Native Dancer by Gwen Reardon was unveiled at Centennial Park in Saratoga Springs. The statue was donated to the city by Marylou Whitney and John Hendrickson. Native Dancer was undefeated in his six starts at nearby Saratoga Race Course.\n\nPedigree\n\nNative Dancer is shown as descending from (family 5-f), which traces back to the Bazajet Mare. However, the female descendants of his third-dam La Chica have a type of mitochondrial DNA that is inconsistent with other descendants of this family. As mitochondrial DNA is passed exclusively in the female line, this indicates a pedigree error occurred at some point between the Bazajet Mare's foaling in 1754 and La Chica's in 1930.\n\nSee also\nList of leading Thoroughbred racehorses\n\nReferences \n\n.\n.\n\n1950 racehorse births\n1967 racehorse deaths\nAmerican Thoroughbred Horse of the Year\nBelmont Stakes winners\nAmerican Champion racehorses\nPreakness Stakes winners\nRacehorses bred in Maryland\nRacehorses trained in the United States\nUnited States Champion Thoroughbred Sires\nUnited States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nThoroughbred family 5-f\nChefs-de-Race", "machine_text": "Native Dancer was a champion Thoroughbred racehorse, born on March 27, 1950, in Poland Spring, Maine, and was foaled by the mare Geisha. He was bred by Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, an American businessman, and owner of the Sagamore Farm in Maryland. Native Dancer is considered one of the greatest American racehorses of all time, winning 21 of his 22 career starts. Native Dancer's racing career began in January 1952, at Hialeah Park Race Track in Florida. He won his first start by nine lengths, and quickly became known for his distinctive grey coat and flashy running style. Native Dancer was known for his come-from-behind style, which often saw him trailing behind the pack before surging forward to take the lead in the homestretch. During his career, Native Dancer won many prestigious races, including the Gotham Stakes, Wood Memorial, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and Dwyer Stakes. He was named American Horse of the Year in 1954 and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In addition to his racing success, Native Dancer also became a household name due to his widespread media coverage. He graced the cover of Time magazine in March 1954, and was featured in numerous films and television shows during his career. After retiring from racing in 1954, Native Dancer began a successful career as a breeding stallion. He sired several notable offspring, including Kauai King, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1966.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sunday school answer\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Sunday school answer\" is a pejorative used within Evangelical Christianity to refer to an answer as being the kind of answer one might give to a child. The phrase derives its name from the concept that certain answers are likely to be an appropriate answer to a question asked in a Sunday school even if one has not heard the question. These answers include Jesus, sin, and the cross.\n\nFor example, if a Sunday school teacher were to ask the question, \"Now class, what is brown and furry and collects nuts for the winter?\", a student might respond, \"It sure sounds like a squirrel, but... is it Jesus?\" The term \"Sunday school answer\" is commonly used to criticize someone for attempting to answer a complex question with an answer that is simplistic, that has not been thought out well, or that is not connected with reality. It can also be used to criticize someone for boastfully trying to call attention to their knowledge of the Bible. \n\nAccording to James W. Fowler's stages of faith development, people who are in Stage 4, the \"Individuative-Reflective\" stage, find such answers an impediment to addressing new questions that they wish to ask.\n\nIn her book Love Letters to Miscarried Moms, Samantha Evans argues that answers dismissed as Sunday school answers \"for being obvious, corny and surface-level answers... are most often the right answers\".\n\nSome Christian educators raise the concern that kids are getting too much Sunday School, eventually leading to spiritual burnout.\n\nNational Basketball Association player Jeremy Lin said in a 2013 interview that, although he \"knew the Sunday school answers\" while he was growing up, it wasn't until he became a high school freshman and joined a youth group where he experienced \"radical love\" that he felt like he wanted to commit to Christianity.\n\nIn Mormonism\n\"Sunday school answer\" is also used in the culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to refer to trite answers that one might provide to a question posed during the church's Sunday School classes. Such answers include \"reading the scriptures, praying daily, serving ... family and others, and attending the temple and ... Sunday meetings\". Church members sometimes argue that if the Sunday School answers are truly implemented in one's life, they are the answers to life's challenges.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nPejorative terms\nEvangelical ecclesiology\nSunday schools\nInformal fallacies\nChristian terminology", "machine_text": "Sunday school answer is a common term used to describe a simplified, commonly-cited response given by religious teachers or leaders to questions posed by young children or newcomers to a particular faith. The term is commonly associated with Christian Sunday schools, which are classes held on Sundays for children to learn the principles of Christianity and its teachings. The origins of the term \"Sunday school answer\" are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the United States during the 19th century when Sunday schools became popular. Sunday schools were established as a way to teach children about the Bible and its teachings. As children were taught basic principles, certain answers became commonly understood and were frequently repeated in response to questions from students. The Sunday school answer is often characterized as an overly simplified and superficial answer that may not fully address the complexities of a particular issue or provide deep insights or explanations. However, these answers are necessary for laying a foundation of basic knowledge which can serve as a starting point for deeper understanding in later years. Sunday schools have been an integral part of religious communities for many years, and they continue to be a valuable resource for teaching children and newcomers about the principles of Christianity. While the Sunday school answer may be viewed by some as a shallow response, it serves as a necessary foundation for deeper discussions and theological exploration.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"George Woolf\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "George Monroe Woolf (May 31, 1910 – January 4, 1946), nicknamed \"The Iceman\", was a Canadian thoroughbred race horse jockey.  An annual jockey's award given by the United States Jockeys' Guild is named in his honor. He became known for riding the people's champion Seabiscuit to victories in 1938.\n\nAfter his early death resulting from a racing accident, Woolf was inducted into newly founded honorary institutions: the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nEarly life and education\nWoolf was born on a ranch in Cardston, Alberta to horse people - his mother had been a trick rider in a circus and his father rode in rodeos. Woolf learned to ride horses as a child and as a teenager he rode in horse races and competed in  rodeo events in Alberta and Montana.\n\nGeorge's mother, Rosina Parker, was born in Wales, and his maternal grandmother was from England. His father, Frank Henry Woolf, was a Utah pioneer born before 1869 and an Alberta pioneer coming to Canada before 1890.  His paternal grandfather Absalom Woolf and great-grandfather J.A. Woolf were Mormon pioneers, both settlers of Cache Valley, Utah.  Absalom Woolf was a soldier in the Utah militia serving in the Walkara Indian War and also the Utah War.\n\nWoolf's ancestor, Peter Woolf, was an early settler of New York, immigrating from Germany.\n\nOn the Newell and Olmstead side of his family, Woolf was related to the fur trapper and mountain man Robert \"Doc\" Newell, and related as well to Charles O. Card, the founder of the town of Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWoolf's rodeo and horse training associates included the Bascom brothers - Raymond, Melvin, Earl and Weldon Bascom.\n\nCareer\n\nHe began racing thoroughbreds professionally in 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He also raced in Tijuana, Mexico before going to Arcadia, California, where he made his permanent home.\n\nUsing Santa Anita Park as his home base, Woolf became one of the premier jockeys of his era; he was known by fellow jockeys and fans as \"The Iceman\". He earned the nickname for displaying the patience in waiting for the right time to have his horse make a move in a race, as well as his calm attitude before major races, when he could take a nap while other jockeys nervously paced about.\n\nWhile establishing himself as one of America's leading jockeys, he was diagnosed with what is now known as type 1 diabetes. Only a few years earlier, before the discovery of insulin, such a diagnosis would have been fatal. Because of his condition, and the nature of diabetes management in the 1930s and 1940s, Woolf had to regulate his weight to avoid rapid dieting. His racing success allowed him to accept only a few mounts each week, riding only 150–200 races each year compared to as many as a thousand rides other jockeys might undertake, and for years he maintained top physical condition.  Despite his limited number of races and a relatively short career, Woolf won ninety-seven major stakes races around the United States, including the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes, the American Derby and the Belmont Futurity Stakes three years running.\n\nHe made history in 1935 when he rode Azucar to victory in the first $100,000 horse race, the Santa Anita Handicap, defeating such greats as Equipoise and Twenty Grand. Woolf finished second twice at the Kentucky Derby and won the 1936 Preakness Stakes. \n\nHe is remembered for his tactical performance in the 1938 match race when he rode Seabiscuit to victory over the heavily favored U.S. Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, in the Pimlico Special at Baltimore, based on advice from his friend, Seabiscuit's injured regular jockey Red Pollard.  When asked which was the best racehorse he had ever ridden, Woolf answered immediately, \"Seabiscuit\".\n\nDeath\nDuring the running of the fourth race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946, Woolf fell from his horse, Please Me, as he rounded the clubhouse turn. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to the hospital, where he died the following day. The jockeys in the race and the track stewards reported that they had not witnessed any incident during the race to have caused such a fall.  Most observers think his diabetic condition may have resulted in his suffering a dizzy spell or fainting.\n\nWoolf was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in The Great Mausoleum, Gardenia Terrace, the Sanctuary of Providence, Mausoleum Crypt 9707 in Glendale, California. Western singing star Gene Autry sang at his funeral service.\n\nLegacy and honors\nThe death at age 35 of one of the country's best and most respected jockeys, and a favorite of fans, led to the creation of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. During his career (1928–1946), Woolf had 3,784 mounts, 721 wins (19.1%), 589 seconds and 468 thirds, finishing in the money 46% of the time.\n\nIn 1950, a life-size bronze statue of Woolf was erected in his honor near the walking ring at Santa Anita Park. It was funded by donations from fans starting in 1948.\nIn 1955 Woolf was an inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nIn 1956 he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 1976, he was one of the inaugural class inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.\nOn July 17, 2010, marking the 100th anniversary of Woolf's birth, a life-size equestrian statue was erected in his home town of Cardston, Alberta at its Remington Carriage Museum. The bronze work was donated by ranchers Jack and Ida Lowe, who had it made by the sculptor Don Toney. It depicts Woolf riding Seabiscuit to victory in the 1938 match race upset against War Admiral.\n\nRepresentation in other media\nWoolf is mentioned as one of the greatest jockeys of all times in the movie The Black Stallion (1979), directed by Carroll Ballard. The film was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 children's novel of the same name.\nIn the film, Seabiscuit (2003), Woolf was portrayed by the jockey Gary Stevens, who has also been inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.  Stevens had won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.\n\nSee also\nList of Canadian sports personalities\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"George Woolf/Seabiscuit memorial statue unveiling – July 17, 2010\", What's new at the Museum?, see Woolf/Seabiscuit statue on this page, Remington Carriage Museum\n\nCanadian jockeys\nCanadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nUnited States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees\nSportspeople from Alberta\nCanadian people of German descent\n1910 births\n1946 deaths\nPeople from Cardston\nSports deaths in California\nBurials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)\nJockeys killed while racing", "machine_text": "George Woolf (May 17, 1910 – January 3, 1946) was a Canadian thoroughbred jockey and the first Canadian-born rider to be inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. Known affectionately as the \"Iceman\" for his cool and unflappable demeanor on the track, Woolf is widely regarded as one of the greatest jockeys of all time. Born in Cardston, Alberta, Woolf began his career in horse racing at a young age. He apprenticed with his father, who was a trainer and jockey in Western Canada, and soon established himself as a skilled rider. In 1928, he made his debut at the Hastings Park racetrack in Vancouver and won his first race. Over the next several years, he competed in races across Canada and the United States, earning a reputation as a skilled and fearless jockey. However, Woolf is perhaps best known for his association with the legendary racehorse Seabiscuit. In 1936, Woolf met Seabiscuit's trainer Tom Smith and began riding the horse in races. Despite Seabiscuit's initial unimpressive record, Woolf believed in the horse's potential and worked tirelessly to educate him. His patience and skill paid off: in 1937, Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita Handicap and became a household name. Woolf continued to ride Seabiscuit until an injury forced him to take a break from racing in 1938. Tragically, Woolf's career was cut short when he died in a racing accident at Santa Anita Park in 1946. He was riding a horse named Please Me in a race when the horse collided with another horse and fell. Woolf suffered a fractured skull and died later that day. He was just 35 years old. Woolf's death was a shock to the horse racing world, and he was mourned by fans and fellow jockeys alike. In 1950, he was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame, and he remains a beloved figure in racing history. Today, the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award is given annually to a jockey who displays exceptional professionalism, integrity, and dedication to the sport.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1945547}

The University is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. The school primarily competes in the Horizon League, but competes in other conferences for fencing and lacrosse, sports not sponsored for either men or women by the Horizon League. Fencing, a co-ed sport, competes in the Midwest Fencing Conference. Men's lacrosse moved from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to the ASUN Conference in July 2021. Women's lacrosse joined the Mid-American Conference for that league's first women's lacrosse season in 2021.\n\nTeams\nA member of the Horizon League, Detroit Mercy sponsors 17 NCAA varsity teams (seven men's, eight women's, and one coed NCAA-sanctioned sports). Detroit Mercy is one of only 4 NCAA Division I schools that sponsors neither volleyball nor baseball (the other 3 being Boston University, Drexel, and Vermont). Previously the Tigers, in either 1919 or 1924 the school adopted the Titans nickname.\n\nNotes\n\nSports\n\nBasketball, men's\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Detroit Mercy named Mike Davis the 22nd head coach in men’s basketball program history. The NCAA Tournament-tested Davis previously coached at Texas Southern University, where he led the team to four regular season titles, four conference tournament championships and four NCAA Tournament appearances. He led Indiana University to the 2002 NCAA Championship game.\n\nStarring for the Titans is Davis’ son, Antoine Davis. In his debut season in 2018-19, Antoine Davis broke the NCAA Division I freshman record for 3-point field goals made in a season, previously held by NBA star Stephen Curry.\n\nFormer head coach Ray McCallum led Detroit Mercy to the Horizon League Championship during the 2011-12 season, granting the Titans an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Detroit Mercy received a 15 seed and lost to the University of Kansas in the tournament's second round.\n\nMcCallum's predecessor Perry Watson led a successful program at Detroit's Southwestern High School and served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan before coming to Detroit Mercy and maintained strong recruiting ties within the city's public league. After 14 seasons Watson stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2007–2008 season. Watson guided Detroit Mercy to 10 winning seasons, three league titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and an NIT Final Four. The Titans two NCAA appearances also included victories over St. John's and UCLA. Between 1997–98 and 2000–01, the Titans had four straight 20-victory seasons.\n\nDick Vitale, ESPN's most well-known college basketball commentator, was the Detroit men's basketball head coach for four seasons (1973–1977) before becoming the school's athletic director in 1977. The following year he left to coach the Detroit Pistons. In his final year as a college head coach, \"Dickie V\" led the Titans to the Round of 16 in the 1977 NCAA Tournament before losing 86–81 to Michigan.\n\nBasketball, women's\n\nOn June 15, 2021, LaTanya Collins was named interim head coach for the 2021-22 season, replacing AnnMarie Gilbert. The program went through turmoil in what proved to be Gilbert's only season.\n\nDuring the 2020–21 season, extensively affected by COVID-19, Detroit Mercy was one of several Division I programs that canceled its season early, but the only one that did so for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. On January 17, 2021, the parents of all 14 players on the roster sent a letter to athletic director Robert Vowels Jr. alleging NCAA rules violations, as well as rampant emotional and physical abuse, by Gilbert. After an internal investigation, Detroit Mercy retained Gilbert, but after all 14 players on the 2020–21 roster left the program, Gilbert resigned on June 15, with assistant Collins taking over on an interim basis.\n\nGilbert’s predecessor, Bernard Scott, led the Titans to 33 wins in his first two seasons, including a trip to the Horizon League championship game at Joe Louis Arena in 2016-17. His contract was not renewed following the 2019-20 season.\n\nScott took over for Autumn Rademacher, a former star guard at Detroit Mercy. Rademacher coached the Titans from 2008-2015, guiding the team to 89 victories, including a 20-win season in 2011-12 and appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) and Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) National Tournament. In 2010–11, Rademacher led Detroit Mercy to a win over in-state rival and Big Ten member Michigan. The victory not only ended a six-game losing streak to Michigan, it was the first triumph over the Wolverines – as well as against the Big Ten – since 1994.\n\nLacrosse, men's\nThe Detroit Mercy men's lacrosse team, coached by Matt Holtz, won the 2013 MAAC Championship and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where they were downed in the fourth quarter by Notre Dame.\n\nFootball (discontinued)\n\nThe first attempt at a football team for the University of Detroit was known as the Detroit Heralds. That team was disbanded after the 1904 season, and most of the players formed an amateur team of the same name in 1905. Although the university team returned in 1906, the amateur team remained, eventually evolving into a semi-professional team, then a professional team, ultimately joining the National Football League as a charter member in 1920. The Heralds folded in 1921.\n\nIn 1928, the Detroit Titans under Gus Dorais finished with a record of 9-0-0. Several years later Parke H. Davis, considered to be a \"major selector\" by the NCAA, named the 1928 team to a share of the national championship\n\nJohn Idzik was the head coach for the final three seasons of the football program, from 1962 until 1964. His coaching record at Detroit was 6 wins, 21 losses and 1 tie.  The school then disbanded the football team after the 1964 season due to cost.\n\nOther\nSince 1996–97, Detroit Mercy athletic teams have won 26 league championships and made 13 NCAA postseason championships. The most recent team to do so was Detroit Mercy's softball team, which won the Horizon League Championship in 2019 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history.\n\nTournaments\nDetroit Mercy has been a host institution for several NCAA Tournament men’s basketball games.

While ska and reggae stylings have always provided the common musical thread, over the past 15 plus years Ruder Than You has been mixing in dancehall, hip hop, rocksteady, and rub-a-dub – even adding elements of funk, jazz, and punk – to create their own unique sound.\n\nIn 1992, Moon Records, officially MoonSKA NYC, put out their debut album, Big Step, and its follow-up Horny for Ska in 1996. By the mid 1990s the group had morphed from a five-piece into a nine-piece outfit and captured a loyal following in the Philadelphia and New York City areas. The group toured nationally, regularly opening up for groups like the Skatalites, Steel Pulse, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Desmond Dekker, Ziggy Marley, Special Beat, Bad Manners, Fishbone, Yellowman, Eek a Mouse, and No Doubt. Ruder Than You CDs were internationally released in Japan and England, and songs can be found on dozens of ska compilations around the globe.\n\nWith Moon Records defunct, the band released their long-awaited third album, Philly Stylee, on their own God’s Ghetto Records label. The album features Trish Johnson on bari-sax and several top Philadelphia guest musicians including jazz trumpeter, John Swana. Philly Stylee was recorded in spurts during the Third-wave ska trend between 1996 and 1999 with final vocal overdubs and mixes completed in 2004. Philly Stylee'''s lengthy production was due to many factors affecting the band.  This included the demise of the band’s former label Moon Records, a 3-year incarceration of lead singer and toaster Freddie \"3D\" Weaver, and the death of bari-sax player Trish Johnson, who was killed in the morning while traveling to Shenandoah, PA, to visit her mother. Despite these obstacles, after taking a nearly 3-year hiatus, the band began rehearsals again in 2003 and completed the CD.\n\nThe band’s latest release, and first truly fresh studio endeavor of the decade, is the 5-song EP entitled God’s Ghetto (2008). The EP is released on the East-African record label Lulu Nyeusi and represents the first known American ska-influenced music release on an African record label. Ruder Than You has always had an eclectic sound and this release is no exception. For this installment, the band chose tunes heavy on old school hip-hop and dancehall and emphasized lyrics penned by Weaver. While these songs differ a bit from the familiar feel of previous albums, they offer the same extraordinary energy and catchiness.\n\nThe band’s current roster of veteran members includes the Round Mound of Dub Sound - singer Freddie Weaver. Band leader Doug Dubrosky still sings and plays tenor sax. He and Don Pancoe on bass hail from the earliest days of RTY. Rod Martino and Chris Klimchak fill out the lineup on guitar and trombone, respectively.

However, it managed to continue publication until 1944.\n\nHistory\n\nLe Petit Provençal was founded in Marseille in 1880, and distributed in south eastern France.\nIt was originally titled La Jeune république (The Young Republic).\nThe founder was Geoffroy Velten (1831–1915), also called Godfried Velten, a Protestant entrepreneur and militant Republican who became a Municipal Councillor in Marseilles in 1880, and on 25 January 1883 was made Senator for Bouches-du-Rhône. Velten also founded L'Égalité.\nThe paper competed with others such as Le Petit Marseillais, Le Radical and Le Soleil du Midi.\nAt first the newspaper published opinions and polemics, but later it became a source of news and information.\nThus, during the campaign in Madagascar, from September 1894 to December 1896 Le Petit Provençal devoted 95 editorials or feature articles on the front page to colonial issues.\n\nLe Petit Provençal paper called itself a Socialist Republican newspaper, but was never the official organ of the socialists.\nBetween 1890 and 1900 it supported socialist candidates of all camps, including Guesdists.\nRegular contributors included Alexandre Millerand, René Viviani, Gustave Rouanet, Clovis Hugues and Léon Mirman.\nAndré Joseph Lefèvre wrote for Le Petit Provençal in the period before World War I (1914–18).\nDuring the period leading up to 1914 the paper emphasized that it supported both radicals and socialists.\nThe circulation was 40,000–50,000 in 1902.\nWhile papers at the time usually gave false circulation figures  Le Petit Provençal by 1913 probably had a daily circulation of about 100,000. Advertising only filled 20% or so of the pages.\n\nBy 1914 Le Petit Provençal had a circulation of 100,000–110,000 in 1914, mostly among the working-class people of Marseilles, although it also sold in the rural parts of the department and in the center of the city, where it faced fierce competition from Le Petit Marseillais.\nLe Petit Provençal continued to take a socialist position after World War I.\nAfter the war the socialist Marcel Déat contributed to the newspaper.\nLe Petit Provençal became the regional organ of the Left. \nOn 29 August 1939, on the eve of World War II (1939–45), Le Petit Provençal called for support for the administrative commission of the Confédération générale du travail (General Confederation of Labor), which had condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Germany.\n\nOn 18 June 1940 Le Petit Provencal and Le Petit Marseillais both published an appeal from General Charles de Gaulle in its entirety.\nShortly after the Vichy government of Marshal Philippe Pétain had been established the newspaper published an article on 18 July 1940 that listed all that had been achieved by the French Third Republic since the 1875 constitution was established. It concluded with the words, \"Vive la liberté! Vive la République!\"\nAmerican films were banned after the Germans arrived in Marseilles. \nLéon Bancal was jailed for an article Adieu á Mickey in Le Petit Provençal.\nThe newspaper was closed in 1944.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\n (21 Issues online)\n\n1880 establishments in France\n1944 disestablishments in France\nPublications established in 1880\nPublications disestablished in 1944\nDefunct newspapers published in France\nFrench Third Republic\nNewspapers of the Vichy regime\nMass media in Marseille\nDaily newspapers published in France", "machine_text": "Le Petit Provençal is a French newspaper that was founded in 1853 in Marseille, France.

These volunteers spend 2–3 hours a week distributing food to others, while they themselves need help, and are allowed to take the same amount of food as those attending the program.\n\nHungry Students – Due to rising tuition, and the rules around qualifications for SNAP benefits, many college campuses are seeing a rise in the number of hungry students enrolled. As a result, many schools are opening pantries on campus to serve those in need. Philabundance's partner, the Chester County Food Bank, and other Feeding America food banks have partner with colleges to ensure this population has enough food to survive and thrive in school. Philabundance will soon follow suit.\n\nPrograms\n Fresh For All Program - To help families and individuals in need gain access to fresh vegetables and fruits, Philabundance operates Fresh For All Program at 9 locations in PA and NJ.\n Senior Boxes Program - Gives USDA-sponsored food boxes to approximately 5,000 low-income senior citizens.\n Philabundance Community Kitchen - A culinary, vocational job training program that teaches low-income and unemployed individuals life and job-readiness skills.\n Grocers Against Hunger- a food rescue program that allows participating grocers to donate surplus inventory to Philabundance.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Chaim Gross\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Chaim Gross (March 17, 1902 – May 5, 1991) was an American sculptor and educator.\n\nChildhood\nGross was born to a Jewish family in Austrian Galicia, in the village of Wolowa (now known as Mezhgorye, Ukraine), in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1911, his family moved to Kolomyia (which was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 and became part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991). During World War I, Russian forces invaded Austria-Hungary; amidst the turmoil, the Grosses fled Kolomyia. They returned when Austria retook the town in 1915, refugees of the war. When World War I ended, Gross and brother Avrom-Leib went to Budapest to join their older siblings Sarah and Pinkas.  Gross applied to and was accepted by the art academy in Budapest and studied under the painter Béla Uitz, though within a year a new regime under Miklós Horthy took over and attempted to expel all Jews and foreigners from the country.  After being deported from Hungary, Gross began art studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, Austria shortly before immigrating to the United States in 1921.\n\nEmigration from Austria to U.S.\nGross' brother Naftoli had arrived in New York City in 1914.  He sent money to his brothers Chaim and Avrom-Lieb, who traveled from Vienna to Le Havre, France, where they took a boat to New York City in March 1921.\n\nEarly Career 1921-1933\nGross's studies continued in the United States at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he studied with Elie Nadelman and others, and at the Art Students League of New York, with Robert Laurent.  He also attended the Educational Alliance Art School, studying under Abbo Ostrowsky, at the same time as Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Adolph Gottlieb, and Peter Blume.\n\nIn 1926, Gross began teaching at The Educational Alliance, and continued teaching there for the next 50 years.  Louise Nevelson was among his students at the Alliance (in 1934), during the time she was transitioning from painting to sculpture.\n\nGross began exhibiting sculpture in group shows of students at the Educational Alliance, and then at the Jewish Art Center in the Bronx. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he exhibited at the Salons of America exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and, beginning in 1928, at the Whitney Studio Club (the precursor to the Whitney Museum of American Art).\n\nIn 1929, Gross experimented with printmaking, and created an important group of 15 linocuts and lithographs of landscapes, New York City streets and parks, women in interiors, the circus, and vaudeville. The entire suite is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gross returned to the medium of printmaking in the 1960s, and produced approximately 200 works in the medium over the next two decades.\n\nIn March 1932, Gross had his first solo exhibition at Gallery 144 in New York City.  For a short time they represented Gross, as well as his friends Milton Avery, Moses Soyer, Ahron Ben-Shmuel and others.\n\nGross was primarily a practitioner of the direct carving method, with the majority of his work being carved from wood. Other direct carvers in early 20th-century American art include William Zorach, Jose de Creeft, and Robert Laurent. Works by Chaim Gross can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the United States, with substantial holdings (27 sculptures) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. A key work from this era, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is the 1932 birds-eye maple Acrobatic Performers,  which is also only one and one quarter inch thick. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\nMaturity 1933-1957\nIn 1933 Gross joined the government's PWAP (Public Works of Art Project), which transitioned into the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which Gross worked for later in the 1930s.  Under these programs Gross taught and demonstrated art, made sculptures that were placed in schools and public colleges, made work for Federal buildings including the Federal Trade Commission Building, and for the France Overseas and Finnish Buildings at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Gross was also recognized during these years with a silver medal at the Exposition universelle de 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, with a purchase prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Artists for Victory\" exhibition for his wood sculpture of famed circus performer Lillian Leitzel.\n\nIn 1938 filmmaker and historian Lewis Jacobs made a 30-minute feature of Gross carving, called Tree Trunk to Head, showing Gross at work in his East Village studio on a portrait of his wife Renee, who models in the film.\n\nIn 1949 Gross sketched Chaim Weizmann, President of Israel, at several functions in New York City where Weizmann was speaking.  Gross began a portrait in clay and then traveled to Israel in the summer of that year hoping to be able to meet Weizmann and have him sit for a portrait.  Weizmann was too ill, but Gross completed the bust in bronze later that year.  Gross returned to Israel for three months in 1951 (the second of many trips there in the postwar years) to paint a series of 40 watercolors of life in various cities. This series was exhibited at the Jewish Museum (Manhattan) in 1953.  \n \nChaim Gross, Sculptor by Josef Vincent Lombardo, the first major book on Gross, came out in 1949. It included a catalogue raisonne of his sculpture.\n\nIn the 1950s Gross began to make more bronze sculptures alongside his wood and stone pieces, and in 1957 and 1959 he traveled to Rome to work with famed bronze foundries including the Nicci foundry.  At the end of the decade Gross was working primarily in bronze, which allowed him to create open forms, large-scale works and of course, multiple casts. Gross's large-scale bronze The Family, donated to New York City in 1991 in honor of Mayor Ed Koch, and installed at the Bleecker Street Park at 11th street, is now a fixture of Greenwich Village.\n\nLater Career 1957-1991\n\nIn 1957, Gross published The Techniques of Wood Sculpture, an influential how-to book with photographs of him at work by famed photographer Eliot Elisofon. In 1959, a survey of Gross's sculpture in wood, stone, and bronze was featured in the exhibit Four American Expressionists curated by Lloyd Goodrich at the Whitney Museum of American Art, with work by Abraham Rattner, Doris Caesar, and Karl Knaths. In 1963, Gross and his family moved from their longtime residence at 30 W. 105th Street to Greenwich Village, following the purchase of a four-story historic townhouse and studio at 526 LaGuardia Place. The townhouse is now the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, winner of a 2015 Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and open to the public.\n\nIn 1974, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held the exhibition, Chaim Gross: Sculpture and Drawings, organized by Janet A. Flint, Smithsonian Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1976, a selection from Gross's important collection of historic African sculpture, formed since the late 1930s, was exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum in the show The Sculptor's Eye: The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross.\n\nIn 1977, Gross had three retrospective exhibitions: at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami, followed by the Montclair Art Museum; and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). The Jewish Museum's exhibition catalog featured an important essay on Gross by art historian and modern American sculpture specialist Roberta K. Tarbell, Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University.\n\nGross received multiple honorary doctorates in the 1970s and 80s: from Franklin and Marshall College (1970); Yeshiva University (1978); Adelphi University (1980); Hebrew Union College (1984); and Brooklyn College (1986). In 1979 Gross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1981. In 1984, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, with Jacob Lawrence and Lukas Foss. Gross died at Beth Israel Hospital in May 1991 and was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Queens, New York. In the fall of 1991, Allen Ginsberg gave an important tribute to Gross at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is published in their Proceedings. In 1994, Forum Gallery, which now represents the Chaim Gross estate, held a memorial exhibition featuring a sixty-year survey of Gross's work.\n\nTeaching\nGross was a professor of printmaking and sculpture at both the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research in New York City, as well as at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the MoMA art school, the Art Student's League and the New Art School (which Gross ran briefly with Alexander Dobkin, Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer).\n\nGross was a member of the New York Artists Equity Association and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. He was a founder and served as the first president of the Sculptors Guild.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932 Gross married Renee Nechin (d. 2005), and they had two children, Yehuda and Mimi.  Mimi Gross is a New York-based artist. She was married to the artist Red Grooms from 1963-1976.\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140620172948/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/gross/index.html\n\nReferences\n Brummé, C.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cumulative inequality theory\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cumulative inequality theory or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory is the systematic explanation of how inequalities develop. The theory was initially developed by Merton (1988), who studied the sciences and prestige. He believed that recognition from peers, and from published research in the scientific field created cumulative advantage (see Matthew affectMatthew effect)  that led to the receipt of resources that facilitated research projects. The theory expanded in four decades to include the idea that some people have more disadvantages than advantages which influence the quality of life of societies, cohorts, and individuals.  The theory is principally a social scientific explanation of phenomena but with links to biological and health factors, personal adjustment, and well-being.  A central premise is that “social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course via demographic and developmental processes.”\n\nDevelopment and application \n\nThe ideas of this theory were developed by Kenneth Ferraro and colleagues as an integrative or middle-range theory.  Originally specified in five axioms and nineteen propositions, cumulative inequality theory incorporates elements from the following theories and perspectives, several of which are related to the study of society:\nRobert Merton articulated the Matthew effect to explain accumulating advantage \nGlen Elder’s life course perspective \nStress process theory \nAge stratification theory.\n\nIn recent years, Ferraro and several other researchers have been testing and elaborating elements of the theory on a variety of topics to provide evidence for the theoretical framework. In the following information you will find some of the uses of this theory in sociological studies.\n\nMcDonough, Worts, Booker, et al (2015) for example studied cumulative disadvantage in the generations of health inequality among mothers in Britain and the United States.  The study examined   “if adverse circumstances early in the life course cumulate as health harming biographical patterns across working and family caregiving years.”  Also, it was examined if institutional context moderated cumulative effects of micro level processes. The results showed that existing health disparities of women in midlife, during work and family rearing time, were intensified by cumulative disadvantages caused by adversities in early life. Thus, the accumulation of disadvantage had negative connotations for the well-being of women's occupational experiences and family life.\n\nMcLean (2010), on the other hand, studied U.S combat and non combat veterans through cumulative disadvantage. He discovered that cumulated negative disadvantages caused by disability and unemployment were more likely to influence the lives of combat veterans versus non combat veterans. Combat veterans suffered physical and emotional trauma that had a disabling effect which impeded their ability to successfully obtain employment. . The research is crucial for social policy implementation that assist United States Veterans to find and retain employment that is suitable to their personal conditions.\n\nIn continuation, Woolredge, Frank, Coulette, et al. ( 2016) studied the prison sentencing of racial groups. specifically of African American males with prior felony convictions. They examined how pre-trial processes affect trial outcomes. It was determined that cumulative disadvantage was existent for African American males and young men; the results were measured by: set bail amounts, pre-trial detention, prison sentencing, and no reduction in sentencing length. The research are striving to create changes in the justice system that reduce incarceration rates of African American Males by reducing bail amounts, and pre trial imprisonment. Further studies are important to decrease the incarceration of minority groups in society, and to create a non biased justice system.\n \nAdditionally, Ferraro & Moore (2003) have applied the theory to the study of long-term consequences of early obesity for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment. The study shows that obesity experienced in early life leads to lower-body disability, but higher risk factors to health. Moreover. The research mentions a risk that has been brought to attention in the past years; it ties being over weight to negative stigma (DeJong 1980),and has influenced fair labor market positioning and wages.\n\nLastly, Crystal, Shea, & Reyes (2016) studied the effects of cumulative advantage in increasing within age cohort economic inequalities in diverse periods of time. The study utilized economic patterns such as annual wealth value and household size. The inequalities of age were analyzed by using the gini coefficient.  The study took place between 1980 and 2010. The results showed that at age 65 plus individuals had higher rates of inequality and it increased significantly for baby boomers or during economic recession and times of war. The research is written to estimate the possible impacts of social security changes on older adults in American Society.\n\nIn conclusion, Cumulative Inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, is broadly examining various topics that impact public policy, and the view of our role within society. Further benefits of the theory are still to be seen in the next coming years.\n\nCore ideas \n\nAccording to Ferraro and Shippee, there are five main ideas in cumulative inequality or Cumulative Disadvantage Theory, which include:\n\n“Axiom 1: Social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes.\nAxiom 2:  Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity.\nAxiom 3: Life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency.\nAxiom 4:  The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories\nAxiom 5:  Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life.”\n\nAxiom 1 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that social structures shape human behavior and interpersonal relations. Furthermore, cumulation in childhood experiences shape life outcomes sometimes in negative ways.  Inequality is, therefore,  not a randomly determined misfortune, but rather a predestined state that one is born into. Although it is possible for inequality to come from an individual's own actions consequences, that is not always true. One's childhood experiences and conditions should also be taken into consideration since these experiences help mold a young individual into an adult.\n\nAxiom 2 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) want us to consider that cumulative advantage and disadvantage are not different they are merely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cumulative Disadvantage is perceived as a risk whereas Cumulative Advantage is an opportunity. \nA well-known concept in sociological sources is that individuals with advantages, whether they are achieved or born into, have a higher rate of opportunity in life. On the contrary, those with many disadvantages are more susceptible to risks throughout their life. For example, one who is born into the majority race with well-educated parents in a developed area will have more exposure to opportunity, whether it be getting a job through one of their parents' college friends or going to a highly rated high school and then being able to get into a highly accredited college. But, on the contrary, one who is born into a minority race with parents who may not have finished high school and live in the ghettos of the roughest town in the city may, not only have less exposure to opportunities, but more exposure to risks such as violence and crime.\n\nAxiom 3 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) state that even though previous life events are important, the overall quality of life is determined by frequently changing trajectories, or the long-term changes in life stability, which are created by an individual's resources, risks, and human agencies. Human agencies simply refer to an individual's own ability to act and think on their own based on their own morals and beliefs. Elder & Shanahan (2006) however, believe that people's responses to stimuli determines changes to the trajectory of life. Moreover, the involvement of the institution in the decision-making process also alters individual decisions and behaviors.\n\nAxiom 4 \nCarstensen (2006) makes the inference that ones view on everyday situations and \nsuccess outcomes is more influential than their actual life status when it comes to their subsequent actions. Drawing from social comparison and symbolic interaction theories, a person's view of their resources may be different from what actually exists, and therefore shapes life trajectories in unique ways. People's view of their lives play a huge role into how they continue their trajectory through the decisions they make, and the activities they choose to partake in. Therefore, the theory makes the claim that those who possess a more positive and optimistic outlook on life typically are more satisfied with their life course.\n\nAxiom 5 \nFerraro, K.F., & Shippee, T.P. (2009) stated that before starting to explain Axiom 5, researchers should avoid cohort inversion. It will limit cohort centered studies, specifically, as it refers to the use of non random sample selection that excludes individuals with greater health issues from the samples. Studying individuals of certain age in this case, older adults, may lead to skewed data if selection of only healthier older adults takes place. The mean concentration of results will be designed to a specific population which will limit the data from being externally valid. The axiom may seem hard to understand at first but the overall meaning is that the accumulation of disadvantages can lead to premature mortality, or in simpler terms, younger death. Also, nonrandom selection may make it seem like mortality rates are decreasing when they are not. Take for example the number of young people deaths in areas with high crime and violence. These individuals are not exposed to many advancing opportunities so they fall victim of the cumulative inequality theory. The nonrandom selection component of the axiom signifies how older populations age in a manner that is not totally random, but rather as a result of the advantages and disadvantages that they have gathered throughout their life. An example is exceptional health care throughout life which prolonged lifespan, or, on the contrary, prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals as a result of working in dangerous environments.\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nSocial theories", "machine_text": "Cumulative inequality theory, also known as cumulative disadvantage theory, is a sociological concept that explains how social inequality increases throughout an individual's life due to factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The theory suggests that individuals who are born into disadvantaged situations, such as poverty or discrimination, face barriers that limit their opportunities and resources. These limitations, in turn, further exacerbate their disadvantage throughout their lifetime. This creates a cumulative effect where inequality builds up over time and becomes more pronounced as individuals progress through life. The idea of cumulative inequality was first introduced by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s who observed that certain groups in society, such as women and minorities, faced significant discrimination and disadvantage compared to others. These researchers studied the ways in which inequality was passed down from generation to generation and how it affected individuals’ life outcomes. The theory of cumulative inequality emphasizes the importance of social institutions, such as schools and workplaces, in perpetuating or mitigating inequalities. For example, schools that provide high-quality education and offer resources such as tutoring and counseling can help to narrow the opportunity gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Similarly, employers who value diversity and provide equal pay and advancement opportunities can help to reduce cumulative inequality in the workplace. In recent years, critics of the theory have argued that it oversimplifies the complex realities of social inequality and fails to account for individual agency and choice in shaping life outcomes. However, proponents argue that the theory remains a relevant and useful framework for understanding the ways in which social inequality is perpetuated and compounded over time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42044690}

Janjgava served in a series of leadership roles after the war, including as Minister of Internal Affairs of Georgian SSR (1954—1958).\n\nEarly life\nVladimir Janjgava was born in the Georgian village of Gubi in May 1907. After graduating he entered the Red Army in 1927 and specialized in military warfare at the Transcaucasus Military-Infantry School in the capital city of Tbilisi. During his service in various Soviet Army formations during Pre-World War II, he rose through the ranks and participated in the Winter War as a junior officer.\n\nWorld War II\nIn 1941, when the Great Patriotic War broke out, Janjgava, who had already reached the rank of Colonel, took part in various defensive operations against German forces in Moldavia and Donets Basin. From March 1942 to April 1943 he commanded the 676th Rifle Regiment and was engaged in critical defensive operations in and around the city of Voronezh, as well as the 1st and 2nd Kastornoye operations, both being part of the greater Voronezh-Voroshilovgrad Strategic Defensive.

At this point, major general Janjgava skillfully managed to divide the fronts at the Weichsel, Narew and Oder rivers. The division fought over a total distance of 1,000 kilometers, liberated Szczecin and participated in the liberation of a total of 20 other cities, before finally reaching Berlin. For outstanding performance and personal courage, Janjgava was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and received various other decorations.\n\nPost-war\nIn 1948, Janjgava graduated from the General Staff Academy and became a lieutenant general.

He is known for his contribution to the development of contemporary Georgian art and is recognized as one of the most prominent figures in the field. Education and Career Born in Zugdidi, Georgia, Janjgava graduated from the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts in 1963 and began working as a painter for Georgian Film Studios. He then continued his studies at the Leningrad Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, where he studied from 1964-1969. In 1970, he became a member of the Georgian Artists’ Union and began exhibiting his work both in Georgia and abroad. Janjgava’s style is characterized by his unique use of color and his expressive brushwork. He was influenced by the Russian Avant-Garde movement, as well as by the works of Western artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Janjgava’s works often feature bold, vibrant colors and dynamic, energetic compositions. In the 1970s, Janjgava co-founded the group “Gmirebi” (meaning “friends” in Georgian), which aimed to develop a new form of artistic expression that combined elements of Georgian folk art with modernist techniques. The group organized a number of exhibitions, which were quite successful and led to a wider recognition of Georgian contemporary art in the Soviet Union and abroad. Legacy Janjgava’s works can be found in many public and private collections, including the Georgian National Museum and the Moscow Museum of Modern Art. He has received numerous awards and honors for his contribution to the development of Georgian art, including the Order of Honor from the President of Georgia in 2011. Janjgava passed away on September 30, 2018, but his legacy lives on through his vibrant and dynamic paintings, which continue to captivate viewers with their expressive energy and colorful intensity.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 35730496}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Kinston Indians\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Kinston Indians were a Minor League Baseball team of the Carolina League (CL) located in Kinston, North Carolina, from 1978 to 2011. They played their home games at Grainger Stadium, which opened in 1949.\n\nThe team began play in 1978 as the Kinston Eagles, borrowing their name from the city's first team of the same name dating back to 1925. They became an affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979 and rebranded as the Kinston Blue Jays in 1982. Kinston reverted to the Eagles moniker in 1986 after the Toronto affiliation ended and became the Kinston Indians upon partnering with the Cleveland Indians in 1987. After the 2011 season, the Carolina League franchise was relocated to Zebulon, North Carolina, for the 2012 campaign to become the Carolina Mudcats. \n\nThe K-Tribe won the Carolina League championship in 1988, 1991, 1995, 2004, and 2006.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\n\nKinston was represented by many amateur clubs since the late nineteenth century, but it was unable to sustain a viable professional team until the mid-1920s. Earlier attempts included an aborted campaign in the Class D Eastern Carolina League in  and an \"outlaw league\" team in  and . The latter was notable for being managed by former major league pitcher George Suggs and College Football Hall of Fame member Ira Rodgers. Due to the efforts of the city's business leaders, former local amateur star Elisha Lewis, and George Suggs, the town secured a professional team in the Virginia League for the  season named the \"Eagles\".\n\nThe Eagles were a Class B team playing out of a then newly renovated stadium designed by Suggs known as West End Park.  The squad had little success against other teams in their league, but was successful enough in gate receipts to validate the city's capacity to sustain a professional team. Kinston's team remained in the Virginia League for three years and then migrated to a newly reformed Eastern Carolina League. This later affiliation collapsed along with the stock market in . The 1920s Eagles' roster included a young catcher named Rick Ferrell, who later had a long playing career and even longer front office career in the major leagues. In , Ferrell became the only former Kinston player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Another player, Frank Armstrong, gave up baseball for a career in the armed services and became one of the most decorated generals in the history of the Air Force.\n\nCoastal Plain League\n\nThe Great Depression took a great toll on the minor leagues, with only thirteen teams operating across the U.S. at a 1933 low point. Like most, Kinston sat out the first few years of the Great Depression but reentered play for the  season in the semi-professional Coastal Plain League. By  the circuit had become a fully professional, Class D league as ranked by the National Association. The city remained in the Coastal Plain League continuously until it was disbanded after . As a member of this affiliation, Kinston saw many playoff appearances and won league championships in  and . Among the superior talent during this period was a young player named Charlie \"King Kong\" Keller who is listed as among the top forty major league players of all-time in terms of on-base percentage (.410).\n\nCarolina League\nKinston was without a team for the three-year period following the dissolution of the Coastal Plain League. In 1956, the owner of the Burlington Bees of the Carolina League moved his team to Kinston. At that time, the Carolina League was a Class B loop with teams located in Virginia and North Carolina. The team, calling itself the Kinston Eagles, were a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate and featured the city's first African American ball players. In these early days of the Civil Rights Movement, the black players in the Carolina League received much verbal and psychological abuse from the largely white, Southern fan base. The first black players were Frank Washington and Carl Long. Long excelled during the 1956 season, setting an RBI standard of 111 that has never been surpassed by any later Kinston hitter. The racial experiment succeeded, but the team failed financially. The Eagles' owner was an inept businessman who brought the club near bankruptcy before it was moved 40 miles away to Wilson in .\n\nKinston's re-entry into Carolina League baseball in  was successful both on the field and at the turnstile. The Eagles were able to claim the first of its Carolina League crowns. At a time when Kinston's population was only 25,000, the ball club attracted over 140,000 fans. Part of the lure was the talent supplied by Kinston's parent club, the Pittsburgh Pirates, which included Steve Blass (17–3, 1.97 ERA, 209 K's), and Frank Bork (19–7, 2.00 ERA). Another fan attraction was that the Eagles were for the first time a community owned team, operating under the non-profit Kinston Eagles Baseball Company, run by an elected eighteen-man, unpaid board of directors. Profits were reinvested into improving the stadium, promoting the team, and supplying playing equipment for the youth of Kinston. This arrangement continued through all thirteen years of Kinston's second tenure in the Carolina League, from  through .\n\nIn  minor league baseball was restructured nationwide, with B, C and D classes eliminated. The Carolina League became a High-A circuit. The Eagles failed to win any championships during this second era of Carolina League play, but they managed to make the playoffs in six of thirteen seasons. The Pirates stuck with Kinston through the  campaign. During three of those four seasons, the Eagles were managed by Harding \"Pete\" Peterson, who later oversaw the Pirates farm system, and become the Pirates' general manager, helping to build the late seventies team that won the World Series. The Eagles became affiliated with the new Atlanta Braves during  and , under the management of Andy Pafko. From  through  the Eagles were affiliation with the New York Yankees; the fans saw a lot of future all-stars pass through the city including a young Ron Guidry who would soon establish himself as one of the best pitchers in the American League.\n\nDuring the 1970s the popularity of minor league baseball reached its lowest point and the attendance in Kinston fell to only 30,000 for the  season. The city needed a revival of interest, and the Expos were turned to for help. The young Montreal franchise boasted a strong farm system with a lot of talent. So much talent in fact, that they decided to experiment with having two High A affiliates. Instead of dividing the players evenly between the two, all the top players were placed in the West Palm Beach club, while the newly renamed Kinston Expos had to make do with castoffs. The Kinston team soon found itself overmatched among its Carolina League rivals. The Expos fell to last place and attendance fell to only 27,000 for the year. Montreal declared the experiment a failure and withdrew from Kinston following the  season. With no major league sponsor and very little fan support, Kinston likewise withdrew from the league.\n\nFormer airline pilot Ray Kuhlman brought minor league baseball back to Kinston by investing in a Carolina League franchise in the late seventies. The renamed Kinston Eagles flew unaffiliated their first season back in the circuit in . By the next campaign, they were associated with the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto stayed with Kinston for seven years, and the team eventually took on the Blue Jay name. Kinston did not win any championships during the Blue Jays years. Kuhlman and his wife ran the team themselves and saw steady annual increases in attendance each year. The couple brought a string of marketing ideas to the team that have taken hold and remain to this day. These include increasing promotional days, fireworks displays, the introduction of Kinston baseball cards, an increase in branded souvenir merchandise, the establishment of the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame, and the hiring of a team mascot. Another fan attraction was a collection of future major league stars including Tony Fernández, Fred McGriff and Cecil Fielder.\n\nFollowing the  season, the Blue Jays dropped Kinston as a franchise, and professional baseball in the city seemed to be in doubt once again. There was talk of moving the franchise to Charles County, Maryland, but the city remained in the Carolina League with an independent ball club that took on the Eagles name.  proved to be disappointing in the standings and at the gate, and talk of a move was renewed, but ownership secured an affiliation with the Cleveland Indians during the off season. For twenty-five years, Cleveland and the KTribe, as they came to be known, enjoyed a successful partnership which produced seventeen playoff appearances and five Carolina League championships (, , ,  and ). The value of the team has risen along with its onfield success. In , Kuhlman sold the team for $100,000. The franchise was sold again in  for $225,000, and changed hands again in  for $750,000. The team's value in  was estimated at $1.5 million.\n\nSix figure attendance totals became the norm throughout the 1990s and into the new century. General Manager North Johnson fostered closer bonds with the mayor's office and helped create the Mayor's Committee for Professional Baseball in . Dedicated to increasing season ticket sales and promoting ties with businesses, the committee accomplished much in a short span of time. Attendance increased by nearly twenty thousand in  and by more than twelve thousand the following year. By , the number of fans through the turnstiles topped 100,000 for the first time since . Although a new ownership group purchased the franchise in , continuity in day-to-day operations was maintained through general manager North Johnson, and front office mainstay Shari Massengill who took over the reins in . The local government's dedication to keeping baseball in Kinston is evidenced by extensive new renovations to the ballpark.\n\nThe Kinston Indians were last managed by Aaron Holbert, a former major league infielder. Their General Manager through the 2010 season, Shari Massengill, and former Assistant General Manager, Jessie Hays, made up the only all-female General Manager/Assistant General Manager team in the Minor Leagues. When Hays departed for the 2008 season, her replacement, Janell Bullock, was also female. The final GM was Benjamin Jones, who was previously employed by the Wilson Tobs.\n\nIn , the Indians won the Southern Division crown for both halves of the year, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the wild card team, the Salem Avalanche. It was the seventh season in a row that the Indians made the post season, which is a new Carolina League record formerly held by the Burlington Bees (–). It was the second time a Kinston team had accomplished this feat. The Kinston Eagles of the Coastal Plain League also made it to seven post seasons in a row (–). Kinston's player development contract with Cleveland ended following the 2011 season. In 2012, the franchise moved to Zebulon, North Carolina and was renamed the Carolina Mudcats.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, the Texas Rangers announced plans to bring a minor league team back to Kinston. The yet-to-be-named Class A-Advanced team will join the Carolina League starting in the 2017 season.\n\nGrainger Stadium\n\nThe Kinston Indians, and all the Kinston teams since 1949, played their home games at Grainger Stadium located at 400 East Grainger Avenue in Kinston. The original structure was built by architect John J. Rowland in 1949 at a cost of $170,000 inclusive of everything except the land. $150,000 of the money was raised by bond issue. The stadium is owned by the city and leased by the team. A dedicatory plaque identifies the structure as \"Municipal Stadium\", but it has been called Grainger Stadium since it was first built. Recent ownership referred to it as \"Historic Grainger Stadium\" due to its age relative to other fields in the Carolina League. It was the second oldest stadium in the circuit. The name Grainger comes from its location on Grainger Avenue as well as its use early on by Grainger High School. Grainger is a prominent old family name in Lenoir County.\n\nAnnual Awards\nEach year, usually on the weekend of the last home games, the Kinston Indians presented awards to those deserving. The team MVP Award was named in honor of \"Cap'n Pat\" Crawford. Crawford was a longtime Kinston resident who made it to the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals during the Gashouse Gang era.\n\nSteve Olin was a right-handed submarining relief pitcher for Kinston who had moved up to the Cleveland Indians. He was killed in a boating accident during spring training of 1993 in Winter Haven, Florida. The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever Tim Crews and seriously injuring Bob Ojeda. Kinston's annual award for Pitcher of the Year was named in his honor.\n\nThe award given each year to the player who had to overcome the greatest adversity in his career was named in honor of Tex Drake. Drake was one of the batboys for the Kinston Blue Jays starting with the  season. On the last day of the  campaign, he found out that he had Hodgkin's Disease which had advanced to all four stages. The club president, Gary Fitzpatrick, arranged for Drake to work as a batboy for the last three home games of the Toronto Blue Jays season. Once back in Kinston, Drake was able to overcome his cancer through chemotherapy and return to his duties on the field.\n\nThe Kinston player who best represented good sportsmanship was given an award named for Steve Gaydek. Gaydek was a former member of the club's Board of Directors who became a lifelong fan of Kinston's baseball teams. He attended every home game for over twenty years even though he lived over thirty miles from the ballpark.\n\nLewis B. \"Mac\" McAvery was the head groundskeeper from  to his death in . In honor of his accomplishments, the team established an award in his name to be given to the individual who has did the most to \"preserve and enhance\" professional baseball in Kinston.\n\nMascots\n\nThe Indians' last mascot was a dog named Scout. Scout was usually found in an Indians jersey and baseball cap, but was also known to don a Superman t-shirt or an aloha shirt depending on the antics he was performing. Scout replaced an earlier Native American mascot who was named Tom E. Hawk. After the introduction of Scout, Tom E. Hawk no longer greeted fans in person at the ballpark, but he was still seen in several of the official logos on much of the team merchandise through the 2010 season. His broadly smiling visage is very reminiscent of Cleveland's Chief Wahoo. In late 2010, the team released new logos which did not include Tom E. Hawk.\n\nDuring the days when Kinston was a Toronto Blue Jays affiliate, the team had a bird mascot named B.J.  manager Dennis Holmberg once resorted to dressing up in the mascot's costume so that he could return to the dugout undetected after being ejected from a game. For the  season, the Blue Jays had a dozen teenage girls, known as the Golden Corral Lady Jays, in the stadium. This experiment only lasted the one season.\n\nLocal baseball personalities\n\nChris Hemeyer: Hemeyer was the radio voice of the Indians as well as the host of Tribe Talk. Tribe Talk was an interview television program shown on local public access stations in southeastern North Carolina. Besides interviewing team members and staff, the show also has highlighted recent Kinston games. First run episodes aired once a week during the season.\nTeam Mamas: Anne \"Mama\" Robinson and Evelyn \"Mama\" Kornegay were local residents of Kinston who hosted players during their stay in Kinston. Mama Robinson hosted players for the first eleven years of the current franchise (1987–1997), while Mama Kornegay took over the duties until her death in 2010. Although only a few of the team members lived in the house at any one time, the homes became popular gathering places and a home away from home for the club. Prior to this arrangement, players had some difficulty establishing a stable environment in which to live. In his autobiography, Ron Guidry relates how his rented mobile home was sold out from under him while he was gone on Reserve duty. David Wells tells similar stories of being bounced around from place to place during his time in Kinston.\nDelmont Miller: (March 30, 1966 – October 25, 2008): Miller was the longtime scoreboard operator for the Indians. His humorous first inning chatter and \"shout-outs\" prior to each \"KTribe\" game had become a tradition at Grainger Stadium. Recognizing the popularity of Delmont with both the fans and the players, the Kinston front office held special \"Delmont Miller Nights\" and built promotions around his unique personality. His twenty-plus year career at the stadium spanned several ownerships and even major league affiliation changes. Prior to becoming the scoreboard operator, he was the clubhouse assistant for the Kinston Blue Jays. His first name came from his father's love of Del Monte brand peaches. On October 25, 2008, the 42-year-old Miller died of a massive heart attack.\nThe Smeraldos: Robert Smeraldo and Robert Smeraldo Jr. were the longtime father/son clubhouse managers for the ballclub. The senior Smeraldo has since died. His son no longer works for the team.\n\nSeason-by-season results \n\nTABLE NOTES:\n DNF = Did Not Finish season.\n Sources\n\nPlayoffs\n1981 season: Lost to Peninsula 1–0 in semifinals.\n1985 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2–0 in semifinals.\n1987 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2–0 in semifinals; lost to Salem 3–1 in championship.\n1988 season: Defeated Lynchburg 3–2 to win championship.\n1990 season: Lost to Frederick 3–2 in championship.\n1991 season: Defeated Lynchburg 3–0 to win championship.\n1993 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2–1 in semifinals.\n1995 season: Defeated Wilmington 3–0 to win championship.\n1996 season: Defeated Durham 2–1 in semifinals; lost to Wilmington 3–1 in championship.\n1997 season: Lost to Lynchburg 3–1 in championship.\n1999 season: Lost to Myrtle Beach 2–1 in semifinals.\n2001 season: Lost to Salem 2–1 in semifinals.\n2002 season: Defeated Myrtle Beach 2–0 in semifinals; lost to Lynchburg 3–1 in championship.\n2003 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 2–0 in semifinals.\n2004 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2–1 in semifinals; defeated Wilmington 3–2 to win championship.\n2005 season: Defeated Winston-Salem 2–0 in semifinals; lost to Frederick 3–2 in championship.\n2006 season: Defeated Salem 2–0 in semifinals; defeated Frederick 3–0 to win league championship.\n2007 season: Lost to Salem 2–1 in semifinals.\n2010 season: Lost to Winston-Salem 3–0 in semifinals.\n2011 season: Defeated Myrtle Beach 3–1 in semifinals; lost to Frederick 3–1 in championship.\n\nNo Hitters\n\nOscar Muñoz (5/26/1991) vs the Prince William Cannons\nPaul Byrd, Scott Morgan, and Mike Soper (8/23/1991) vs the Prince William Cannons\nJason Rakers (6/4/1997) vs the Durham Bulls (7 inning game)\nKeith Ramsey (9/6/2004) vs the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (perfect game)\nMarty Popham, Chris Jones and Cory Burns (9/5/2010) vs the Potomac Nationals (10 innings)\n\nSee also \nKinston Eagles – Previous baseball teams in Kinston known as the Eagles\n\nBibliography\n\nAutobiographies and biographies\n\nLeague histories\n\nNewspapers \n  – Issues for the 1908 season do not exist.

In 1845 he was appointed to a clerical position, that of chaplain in Leikanger. In 1849 the district of Balestrand was separated from Leikanger as an own parish, and Sverdrup became vicar (sogneprest) of the new parish. He published several works, mostly based on Erik Pontoppidan's explanation of the Luther's Small Catechism.\n\nAs his brother, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup became involved in politics. When Balestrand became a municipality of its own in 1849, Sverdrup became its first mayor. He sat as mayor until 1879. He was among the establishers of the local savings bank in 1847, and of the transport company Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe (later: Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane) with Jan Henrik Nitter Hansen and Michael Aubert in 1858.\n\nHe was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1851, representing the constituency of Nordre Bergenhus Amt. He was re-elected in 1854, 1857, 1859, 1862, 1865 and 1868. In 1870 he lost the election due to disagreements with Søren Jaabæk and his supporters, but Sverdrup later returned for a final term from 1874. Harald Ulrik Sverdrup stepped down as a priest in 1883.\n\nWhen he stepped down, his son Jakob Sverdrup stood for election, and won. He also became a government minister. A daughter of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup married the priest and Nynorsk proponent Eirik Olson Bruhjell. They had met while Sverdrup was the private tutor of Bruhjell. Another of his sons, Edvard Sverdrup, became a professor of theology.

He was the son of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup Sr., a prominent Norwegian professor and historian. Sverdrup was educated in Oslo, at the University of Kristiania (now known as the University of Oslo), where he studied law and economics. Sverdrup's political career began in 1928, when he was elected to the Norwegian parliament, representing the Liberal Party. He served as the Minister of Finance from 1931 to 1933, and again from 1935 to 1942. In 1935, he became the leader of the Liberal Party. During the German occupation of Norway, which lasted from 1940 to 1945, Sverdrup became a prominent figure in the country's resistance movement.

She was a professor at San Jose State University and retired in 1988.\n\nEarly life and education \nDaughter and oldest child of three of Nicolas Kitsikis and Beata Merope Petychakis, she was born in Athens. Greece. Nicolas Kitsikis was full professor and rector of the National Technical University of Athens (Athens Polytechnic School)  and had served as General  Director of Public Works in the government of Eleftherios Venizelos, 1917–1920. At the time of her birth, he was a technical director for the British company MacAlpine and had, among other projects, built the harbour of Heraklion, Crete.\n\nBeata Petychakis, born July 14, 1907, in Heraklion, Crete, was the daughter of Emanuel Petychakis, a Cretan Greek, doing business in Egypt. Beata Petychakis married Nicolas Kitsikis at 16 and moved to Athens where Panagopoulos was born. Panagopoulos grew up in various places, in central Athens, in the suburb of Ekali and eventually, in the neighborhood called Kolonaki.\n\nPanagopoulos finished high school in 1943. During the next two years she studied architecture at the National Technical University of Athens, and archeology at the School of Philosophy, University of Athens (UoA). In February 1947, Panagopoulos left Greece for the United States, where she had received a scholarship to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. There she completed both her Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in the field of Medieval Art History under Professor Ulrich Middeldorf.\n\nLater life, teaching, and further education \nAt the University of Chicago, she met a doctoral student, Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos, (Nondas). They subsequently married and had two children. The family moved first to Detroit, Michigan, where Nondas began teaching at Wayne State University. In 1956, the family moved to San Jose, California, where Nondas taught American History at San Jose State University (SJSU). During this period of time she and Nondas co-authored the sections on “Modern Culture” in the chapter on “Greece” in the 1958 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana.\n\nPanagopoulos earned teaching certificates in Art and French and began teaching at Fremont High School, Sunnyvale. In 1961, she began teaching Art History at Foothill College. In 1962, she was accepted at Stanford University in the Art History PhD program, but transferred to the University of California, Berkeley’s Art History Department in 1964. Completing her dissertation at the Sorbonne in Paris, she received her PhD in 1970. From then on, she taught at SJSU until 1988.[1]\n\nDuring this time she was appointed Kress Professor of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece and concurrently served three years as director of the Gennadius Library.\n\nThe 1970s, teaching and writing about the humanities \n\nTwo major experiences in the 1970’s contributed to the development of Panagopoulos’ teaching philosophy which emphasized the importance of a humanities education. First, at SJSU, she became a professor in the innovative educational four-year program called New College, an intensive study program based on small seminars, exploring important themes of modern life.\n\nThe second illustration was Panagopoulos’ tour of China in 1975. This was a tour for educators led by the Chinese government and was part of Mao Zedong’s first efforts to show China to the world. Panagopoulos’ response was enthusiastic and resulted in an article in the UCLA Educator 1976, entitled: On Creativity in the People’s Republic of China, An Art Historian’s Perspective. and in the content of her course on Women and Art at New College\n\nMajor work: Frankish monastic architecture in Greece \nIn 1979, Panagopoulos’ book Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece was published by the University of Chicago Press:\nThis is the only comprehensive study of the most outstanding extant Gothic monasteries built during the French and Italian occupancy of Greece after the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 CE.-- Walter Horn, University of California, Berkeley\nIn Cistercian and Mendicant Monasteries in Medieval Greece, Panagopoulos examined the development of  Latin ecclesiastical architecture in Greece. She provided new data, including photographs and drawings. In the past this subject area had been too difficult for medievalists and art historians to access. Google Scholar provides citations to 43 scholars that have in turn referred to this work.\n\nKress Professor and director of the Gennadius Library \nIn 1982, Panagopoulos was awarded the position of Kress Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (ASCSA) and in July 1983, was made the director of the American School’s Gennadius Library, a collection of Greek history, literature and art from antiquity to modern times and part of the ASCSA. This was a notable appointment since the library had not had a director since 1977. She served in this position until July 1986. During her watch, the Gennadius Library opened for additional hours and two evenings a week leading to a substantial increase in the number of people using the library. The physical structure of the library was remodeled. A new exhibition room and a section for archival research were added to the building.\n\nUnder Panagopoulos’ leadership the following of the library increased substantially. The monthly  lectures, chamber music concerts and exhibits grew in popularity. The library had an exhibit on the literary activities in Thessaloniki, another on the treasures of Mt. Sinai and the Patriarchate of Alexandria and a third on the achievements of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1985 Athens was selected as the European Capital of Culture and the Gennadius Library fully participated in events throughout the year. The library was part of five exhibitions and in addition contributed substantially to a television program on the life of Joannes Gennadius.\n\nTurco-Baroque domestic architecture \nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Panagopoulos did her own research and synthesized fragmented studies surrounding certain large mansions (Greek: αρχοντικά) built in Greece and the remaining Balkans between 1700 and 1900. Her work recognized as an emerging class the owners of these mansions who were merchants dealing in products—leather, wax, fabrics—from the Ottoman Empire for sale in lucrative European markets like Madrid, Vienna and Venice. This class of merchants was secure in their language and their religion but did not have fixed commitments as to their ethnicity. They would leave at the beginning of  spring and return home at the beginning of  the winter. Slowly they became rich and built homes using itinerant builders mostly from Greece’s Epirus and western Macedonia regions.\n\nAwards \nIn 1982 Panagopoulos received, in Greece, the Academy of Athens annual award for the humanities. In addition, in the United States, in 1992, she received the Hellenic American Professional Society of California's  Axion Award.\n\nPersonal \nPanagopoulos’ husband of 48 years was Epaminondas Petros Panagopoulos. They had two children. Panagopoulos retired in 1988 from SJSU and has spent the remaining years living in San Francisco and traveling frequently.\n\nPublications \nPanagopoulos, Beata Kitsikis (1979).

Its handle was crafted from golden wood, and its barrel was made from the finest steel. The weapon was said to be able to shoot faster and more accurately than any other gun in existence. Moreover, it was said to be imbued with magical powers, capable of granting wishes to its owner. Many claim to have seen the Golden Gun throughout history. Some even claim to have possessed it at one point, but the weapon has never been found. Some say that it was lost in battle, while others believe that it was purposely hidden away to keep its power out of the wrong hands.

Welch (1899-1985) was an American businessman and political activist, best known for founding the John Birch Society, a far-right organization dedicated to promoting anti-communist and conservative ideals. Born in Chowan County, North Carolina, Welch attended the University of North Carolina before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in chemical engineering. He went on to work for the Phillips Petroleum Company and later founded his own company, the Welch Foundation, which developed industrial chemical processes. In 1958, Welch founded the John Birch Society, named after an American Baptist missionary and military intelligence officer killed by Chinese communists in 1945. The organization quickly gained a following among conservative activists who were concerned about the influence of communism on American society and government. The John Birch Society promoted limited government, traditional values, and a strong anti-communist stance. Over the years, Welch and the John Birch Society became increasingly controversial. Critics accused the organization of promoting conspiracy theories and fostering paranoia about communist infiltration. Welch was also criticized for his extreme views on race, including his opposition to the civil rights movement and his belief that the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education was a communist plot. Despite these controversies, Welch remained a major figure in conservative politics throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He continued to speak out against communism and advocate for a conservative agenda until his death in 1985. Today, the John Birch Society still exists as a political organization, although it has largely lost influence and relevance in mainstream American politics. Welch's legacy remains controversial, with some admiring his dedication to conservative ideals and others criticizing his extreme views and divisive rhetoric.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 57264747}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Romaine Sawyers\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Romaine Theodore Sawyers (born 2 November 1991) is a Kittitian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for  club Stoke City, on loan from West Bromwich Albion. He plays international football for the Saint Kitts and Nevis national team.\n\nA West Bromwich Albion academy graduate, he had brief spells on loan at Port Vale, Shrewsbury Town and Walsall. He signed with Walsall in July 2013, following his release from West Brom. He played on the losing side in the 2015 final of the Football League Trophy. He was named in League One's PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2015–16 season. He joined Brentford in July 2016 and went on to serve as club captain before he returned to West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee in July 2019. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Championship at the end of the 2019–20 season and was also named in the PFA Team of the Year. West Brom were relegated the following year and he was loaned out to Stoke City for the 2021–22 season.\n\nEarly life\nSawyers was raised by Diane, a single mother who also raised foster children and did many hours of community work in Birmingham. She remained a big influence on her son, who went on to work closely with the community development teams at his football clubs, as well as with the charity Kick It Out.\n\nClub career\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\nSawyers first made the West Bromwich Albion substitute bench for the final game of the 2008–09 season. Following this, he won his first professional contract with the club. However, he spent most of the 2009–10 season nursing a knee injury. On 21 January 2011, he joined Jim Gannon's Port Vale on a one-month loan, along with Kayleden Brown. He made his debut for the League Two club two days later, in a 1–0 defeat to Cheltenham Town at Vale Park, replacing Adam Yates. However this was to be his only game for the club, as the pair returned to The Hawthorns after the loan spell ended with Sawyers having made no further first team appearances.\n\nOn 27 January 2012, he joined Graham Turner's League Two Shrewsbury Town on a one-month loan, and the following day he was named as an unused substitute for the 2–0 win at Hereford United. He made his first league start against Torquay United at Plainmoor on 11 February. On 25 February, it was announced his loan had been extended until the end of the 2011–12 season. In total he made two starts and five substitute appearances for Shrewsbury.\n\nWalsall\nSawyers joined League One club Walsall on loan in March 2013; manager Dean Smith said that \"He's a talented lad who can play-off the front-man... I know that Albion rate him highly, so it's good to have him on board.\" He made four substitute appearances for the club. He was released by West Brom in June 2013. Following his release from West Brom, Sawyers signed a permanent one-year deal at Walsall in July 2013; Dean Smith stated that he saw potential and an excellent attitude in the player despite his limited playing time on loan. On 17 August 2013, he marked his first senior start for Walsall with his first goal from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw with Notts County at the Bescot Stadium. He finished the 2013–14 season with seven goals in 49 appearances, and signed a new two-year deal with the club.\n\nOn 13 September 2014, he was described as a \"shining light throughout\" in a 3–1 home win over Preston North End, earning a place on the Football League team of the week. He played in the 2015 final of the Football League Trophy, a 2–0 defeat to Bristol City, which was Walsall's first appearance at Wembley Stadium. In total he scored five goals in 51 appearances in the 2014–15 season, and was praised by manager Smith despite being criticised by some supporters. He won a place on the Football League team of the week after scoring a brace – including a \"25-yard rocket into the top corner of the net\" – in a 4–0 triumph at Blackpool on 29 August 2015. He was named in League One's PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2015–16 season, alongside teammate Rico Henry. He was also nominated for the PFA League One 'Player of the Year', and finished as runner-up to Gillingham's Bradley Dack. He rejected the club's offer a new contract and departed as a free agent at the end of the season.\n\nBrentford\nOn 1 July 2016, Sawyers signed with Championship club Brentford in a move that reunited him with former Walsall boss Dean Smith. He made his debut for the \"Bees\" in a 2–1 away defeat to Huddersfield Town on the opening day of the 2016–17 season. He scored his first goal for Brentford in a 2–0 win over West London derby rivals Queens Park Rangers on 28 October. He ended the 2016–17 campaign with three goals in 45 matches, helping Brentford a tenth-place finish as the key link between defence and attack. He scored five goals and contributed five assists in 44 appearances across the 2017–18 season as Brentford finished in ninth position, and was described as \"one of the standout players at Griffin Park this season with his touch and passing range impressing many\". He was voted Players' Player of the Year by the Brentford squad and was also named as Community Player of the Year.\n\nHe was reported to be a transfer target of West Bromwich Albion manager Darren Moore in June 2018. Soon after taking charge at Brentford, new manager Thomas Frank named Sawyers as the new club captain in November 2018. Frank moved Sawyers further down the pitch as part of two central midfielders with Kamohelo Mokotjo rather than as one of three. He made 46 appearances during the 2018–19 season and was linked with a move to Aston Villa in the summer.\n\nReturn to West Bromwich Albion\nOn 27 July 2019, Sawyers returned to West Bromwich Albion, signing a three-year contract after being bought for an undisclosed fee (reported to be £2.9 million); Sawyers stated that \"this is the team that I have always wanted to play for\". Manager Slaven Bilić said that \"we targeted him as a player who will raise the quality in our midfield\". He chose to wear the #19 shirt in homage to former midfielder Jason Koumas. On 22 February 2020, he was sent off after putting his hand to the throat of former Walsall teammate Jamie Paterson during a 3–0 win at Bristol City. During break in play due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, FourFourTwo magazine listed Sawyers as the ninth best player in the EFL. He ended the 2019–20 season with one goal in 43 appearances as the \"Baggies\" secured the Championship's second automatic promotion place. He was also named in the Championship's PFA Team of the Year.\n\nOn 29 December 2020, he scored what The Guardian's Paul Doyle described as a \"slapstick own goal\" in a 5–0 defeat to Leeds United at The Hawthorns. Sawyers took to Twitter to say that \"I take full responsibility for setting the tone for what went on to be a difficult night for us all to stomach!\" Sawyers barely featured in the second half of the 2020–21 season as the club suffered relegation under the stewardship of Sam Allardyce.\n\nLoan to Stoke City\nOn 20 August 2021, Sawyers joined Championship rivals Stoke City on loan for the 2021–22 season. Manager Michael O'Neill stated that \"we didn't anticipate that Romaine would become available\" but acted quickly to sign Sawyers after he had fallen behind Jake Livermore and Alex Mowatt in the pecking order at West Brom.\n\nInternational career\nSawyers represented Saint Kitts and Nevis national under-23 football team in the second round of the Caribbean Football Union's qualifying phase for the 2012 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship. In the three games the team played, he scored four goals. He was called up to the full team for the qualification for the 2012 Caribbean Cup. He scored a goal and claimed an assist on his debut, in a 2–0 win over Anguilla at the Warner Park Sporting Complex in Basseterre.\n\nStyle of play\nSawyers has a languid style of play, which can make him appear lazy at times despite statistics indicating a relatively high work rate. He can play as an attacking midfielder, playmaker or as a central midfielder. He played most his career as a 'number 10' under his former manager Dean Smith who managed him at Walsall and Brentford, before being converted into a central midfielder under Manager Thomas Frank at Brentford who also made him captain due to his leadership qualities. Sawyers is known for his ability to dictate games from midfield, his range of passing, and his ability to carry out successful difficult passes and help his team-mates start attacks.\n\nPersonal life\nIn January 2021, a 49-year-old man from Kingswinford was arrested after a racist message was sent to Sawyers on social media during West Brom's loss to Manchester City. In September 2021, the man was jailed for eight weeks.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nInternational\n\nInternational goals\nScores and results list Saint Kitts and Nevis' goal tally first.\n\nHonours\nWalsall\nFootball League Trophy runner-up: 2014–15\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\nEFL Championship second-place promotion: 2019–20\n\nIndividual\nPFA Team of the Year: 2015–16 League One\nBrentford Players Player of the Year: 2017–18\nBrentford Community Player of the Year: 2017–18\nPFA Team of the Year: 2019–20 Championship\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1991 births\nLiving people\nCitizens of Saint Kitts and Nevis through descent\nSaint Kitts and Nevis footballers\nAssociation football midfielders\nSaint Kitts and Nevis international footballers\nFootballers from Birmingham, West Midlands\nEnglish footballers\nWest Bromwich Albion F.C. players\nPort Vale F.C. players\nShrewsbury Town F.C. players\nWalsall F.C. players\nBrentford F.C. players\nStoke City F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nPremier League players\nBlack British sportspeople\nEnglish sportspeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis descent", "machine_text": "Romaine Sawyers is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Bristol City, on loan from West Bromwich Albion.

It is the center of Shchuchyn District. The population is nearly 15,000 (2010).\n\nHistory\n\nThe first known official written mention of Shchuchyn is recorded in 1436, but its foundation as a settlement dates back to 1537, when 'Shchuchyn was mentioned in the Book of Acts of the Lithuanian Metrica (the Book of Lithuanian vital records), kept in the Governmental archive in Lithuania.\n\nOwnership of Shchuchyn passed from one noble family to another: The Radziwiłł family, then the Drutskiya-Liubetskis, the Scipions, and others ruled Shchuchyn in turn. In the 15th–18th centuries, Shchuchyn became a member of the Lida council of the Vilnius office of voivode. In the first half of the 17th century, Shchuchyn was governed by the outsider marshal of the Lithuanian principality, Scipio de Campo. Shchuchyn was an average-sized privately owned village in terms of population.\n\nA Catholic Monasterial Order was established 1726 in Shchuchyn by the resolution of the Sejm. The Board of Shchuchyn was considered to be one of the biggest in Belarus.\n\nShchuchyn was subject to ruin and ravage more than once in its history. The biggest was in the time of the North War, after the town was seized by the Swedish king Karl XII. After the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Shchuchyn became a part of the Russian Empire. In June 1812 Shchuchyn was occupied by French troops. And again in 1915, by the German Kaiser. In 1919 the Red Army attempted to seize Belarusian land by taking and fortifying the Martinkantsy - Shchuchyn - Shchara - lake Vygonovskoe line. However, the superior defence forces of the \"Land of Grodnenskaya\", together with Poland, forced the Red Army back. In 1939, Western Belarus, together with Shchuchyn, went under the control of the Soviet authorities. In World War II, Shchuchyn was occupied by German troops.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation from 25 June 1941 until 13 July 1944 the Nazi forces killed about 2180 Jews from the Shchuchyn ghetto with the majority of them killed on 10(9) May 1942. \n\nIn 1962, Shchuchyn was granted town status.\n\nAir base \nUntil the collapse of the Soviet Union Shchuchyn was a home of one of the biggest Soviet air bases with over 5,000 personnel assigned to it in the 1990s.

The air base hosted different types of the Soviet planes throughout the years, such as IL-28, MiG-15, MiG-19, An-14, MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, and others. Most famously in the early 1990s it was a home of about 40 MiG-25BM defense-suppression aircraft, which represents the vast majority of this modification of MiG-25 ever produced. The base was controlled by the 95th air wing.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Katsuo Tokashiki\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Katsuo Tokashiki (渡嘉敷 勝男, born July 27, 1960 in Okinawa, Japan) is a Japanese former WBA Light flyweight champion. He currently works as an actor and television persona, and runs own boxing gym in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nChildhood & Early Career \nTokashiki was born in Okinawa, but was raised in Takarazuka, Hyogo. He caused all sorts of trouble from an early age, and was infamous in his local town by the time he reached high school. He dropped out of school to begin training as a professional boxer, and traveled to Tokyo, where he entered the Kyoei boxing gym. The WBA Light flyweight champion Yoko Gushiken also trained at the Kyoei gym during the same period. Tokashiki made his professional debut in December, 1978.\n\nProfessional career \nTokashiki was a short (even for a light flyweight) and quick fighter, and quickly emerged as one of Japan's best youngest boxers. He did not mark a KO victory until his 12th professional fight in 1980.\n\nTokashiki compiled a record of 13-1-1 (2KOs) before challenging Hwan Jin Kim for the WBA Light flyweight title in December, 1981. Yoko Gushiken had lost the WBA title to Pedro Flores, after defending it 13 times. Flores in turn lost his title to Kim and Tokashiki set out to avenge his gymmate's Gushiken's loss of his title. Tokashiki won the world title with by unanimous decision, but a scandal involving the Kyoei gym's management was revealed the same day, and Tokashiki's victory was marred by controversy, since he and the previous champion, Gushiken, both trained with the gym.\n\nRegardless, Tokashiki compiled 5 straight defenses, but lost his title to Lupe Madera, (who he had fought two previous times in defenses) after he was injured in the 4th round. Tokashiki got a rematch in October, 1983, but lost  a close unanimous decision in 15 rounds. The WBA would have allowed another rematch, but Tokashiki did not want to fight Madera for a fifth time, and decided to challenge Korean boxer Jung Koo Chang for the WBC Light flyweight title instead.\n\nThe match took place in Korea, where Chang was already a national hero. This was the only time Tokashiki fought outside Japan in his career, and he knew he had to win by KO to capture the title. Tokashiki was aggressive from the first round, and pinned the champion against the corner, when he was knocked down for the first time in his career with a counter left hook. However, Tokashiki managed to tire out the champion by the 5th round, and Chang showed fatigue, clinching repeatedly, and slipping in the 8th round. Chang's corner bought time by having to retape the champion's gloves twice during rounds, and in the 9th round, Chang surprised Tokashiki with a sudden flurry of punches. Tokashiki was staggered, and the referee immediately stopped the fight to declare Chang the victory, despite the fact that Tokashiki had remained standing as Chang collapsed to the canvas after hearing that he had won. Chang was only 21 years old at the time, he defended the WBC title 15 times. Tokashiki announced his retirement shortly after this fight. His record was 19-4-2 (4KOs).\n\nPost Retirement \nLike many other Japanese boxers, Tokashiki became a television persona after retiring from boxing, and has appeared on several variety television shows. He has also worked as an actor, and took the role of boxer Fighting Harada in a television drama series in 1990. His appearances on television have decreased lately, but he created the Tokashiki Boxing Gym in Tokyo, and currently works as a trainer there. He also petitioned the court to order Iwao Hakamada's retrial.\n\nSee also \nList of WBA world champions\nList of Japanese boxing world champions\nBoxing in Japan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n Tokashiki Boxing Gym (Japanese)\n\n1960 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Okinawa Prefecture\nWorld Boxing Association champions\nWorld boxing champions\nJapanese boxing trainers\nJapanese male boxers\nBoxing commentators\nLight-flyweight boxers", "machine_text": "Katsuo Tokashiki (born 2nd May 1974) is a Japanese basketball coach and retired professional basketball player.

It takes place in a mythic New York City, markedly different from reality, and in an industrial  Edwardian era near the turn of the 20th century. The novel was adapted into a 2014 feature film by Akiva Goldsman.\n\nCharacters\n\nPeter Lake\nPeter Lake is the central character of Winter's Tale. An immigrant couple who were denied admission at Ellis Island due to consumption are forced to return to the ship City of Justice which had brought them. They break the display case containing a model of their ocean-going vessel and set their son Peter adrift in New York Harbor inside it. He is found in the reeds and adopted by the Baymen of the Bayonne Marsh, who send him off to Manhattan when he comes of age. There he first becomes a mechanic and then is forced to become a burglar in a gang called the Short Tails. He soon makes a mortal enemy of their leader, Pearly Soames, and is constantly on the run from the gang. Early one winter morning, Peter is on the brink of being captured and killed by the gang when he is rescued by a mysterious white horse, who becomes his guardian.\n\nWhile attempting to rob a house, Peter Lake meets and falls in love with Beverly Penn. The daughter of millionaire Isaac Penn, owner and publisher of The Sun, one of New York's greatest newspapers, Beverly is eccentric, free-spirited, and enigmatic. This captivates Peter initially, but her deeper nature is revealed with her terminal consumption. Beverly never disappears from Peter's life, protecting him until the very end. His love for the dying Beverly causes him to become obsessed with justice.\n\nIn yet another escape from Pearly's men, both Peter Lake and the white horse crash into a mysterious recurring cloud wall, disappearing in it for decades. When Peter Lake emerges, he no longer remembers who he is and is visibly no longer of this world, seeing and hearing things that nobody else can see or hear. One night, in a dream or a vision, he is carried on a tour of all the graves of the world, observing and remembering all the dead. In the apocalyptic chaos of burning New York, he acquires astonishing powers.\n\nPeter Lake refers to himself, earlier in his life, as \"Grand Central Pete\". In reality, there was a well-known confidence man in the late 19th century known by this name.\n\nAthansor\nAthansor, the white horse, acts as a guardian angel of Peter Lake. Able to fly and possessing extraordinary endurance, the white horse appears to be an angelic being. Before the end, Peter Lake releases him to finally let him go to heaven, as Athansor had not been able to do before because of Peter Lake.\n\nThe white horse appears on the first pages of the book, saving Peter Lake who is being pursued by the Short Tails. The name of the horse is unknown to Peter Lake, but when Peter Lake visits Bayonne Marsh, the Baymen recognise the horse as Athansor, part of their oral lore. The Baymen arrive from everywhere to view the horse, but never explain what they know about him besides the name and the fact that he comes from the left.\n\nAthansor is separated from Peter Lake when they both crash into the cloud wall but gets reunited with him towards the end of the story. Peter Lake releases him, and Athansor heads towards the heavenly pastures. As he gallops across Manhattan, trying to lift off, the whole island shakes under his hoofbeats.\n\nBeverly Penn\nBeverly Penn is a young woman dying from consumption who meets Peter Lake when he breaks into her house. Beverly is a visionary who can feel the universe. She writes down equations that explain the universe and mean for her that the universe shouts and growls. Beverly's father, newspaper publisher Isaac Penn, says about her that she had seen the Golden Age.\n\nEven after her death, Beverly protects Peter Lake. Pearly Soames says that he tried but could not get to Peter Lake through Beverly's protection.\n\nJackson Mead\nA master bridge builder and an enigmatic figure, Jackson Mead constructed many fine bridges all around the country. He is a brilliant engineer and appears to have unlimited material resources for the job. He is eventually revealed to be an exile from heaven, whose purpose is to build one last bridge that will bring forth the end of the world as it is, letting him return to heaven. As Jackson Mead puts it, his purpose is \"to tag this world with wider and wider rainbows, until the last is so perfect and eternal that it will catch the eye of the One who has abandoned us, and bring Him to right all the broken symmetries and make life once again a still and timeless dream. My purpose, Mr. Marratta, is to stop time, to bring back the dead. My purpose, in one word, is justice.\" Jackson Mead's rainbow bridge does not take, but he is not upset by the failure and disappears to bide time until his next attempt.\n\nIt is interesting that Jackson Mead's stated goal \"to stop time and bring back the dead\", in precisely these words, is widely associated with Peter Lake and in particular attributed to him on the back of the paperback edition.\n\nJackson Mead's character is partially based on Joseph Strauss, the engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hardesty Marratta recognizes Jackson Mead's face in the face of the monument to Joseph Strauss at the Golden Gate. The inscription on the monument refers to the bridge as the \"eternal rainbow\", a simile used by Jackson Mead.\n\nHowever, despite being a main character in the novel, he does not make an appearance in the movie.\n\nResidents of Lake of the Coheeries\nLake of the Coheeries is a semi-mythical lake and village, playing the role of Faerie, Elfland, or Alfheim.  Lake of the Coheeries is fictional, supposedly located in upstate New York across a mountain range from the Hudson River Valley.  Virginia Gamely is a resident there, living with her mother, Mrs. Gamely.  Both women ultimately play roles in New York City at the end of the tale.  Virginia's daughter is resurrected by Peter Lake.\n\nLiterary significance and reception\nWinter's Tale was published in 1983.  It was praised on the front cover of the New York Times Book Review (NYTBR) as \"funny, thoughtful, passionate...large-souled.\" \nReviewing the novel in Interzone magazine, Mary Gentle described Winter's Tale as\n\"a faerie family saga\" and \"the first specifically capitalist fantasy\".\nDavid Pringle, in the book Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels, praised Winter's Tale as \"a haunting piece of North American\nmagic realism\".\nIn May 2006, the New York Times Book Review published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to \"a short letter [from the review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to identify 'the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.'\" Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin's Winter's Tale.\n\nFilm adaptation\nThe film adaptation was released on Valentine's Day, 2014 and starred Colin Farrell as Peter Lake, Russell Crowe as Pearly Soames, Jessica Brown Findlay as Beverly Penn, Jennifer Connelly as Virginia Gamely, and Will Smith as Lucifer though originally credited as \"Judge\".\n\nThe movie began filming in New York in October 2012  with a slight delay due to Hurricane Sandy. Shooting on the film ran through early 2013 and operated on a $60 million budget, down from the original $75 million budget. It is unknown when Helprin sold the movie rights, with one report of Martin Scorsese originally purchasing the rights.\n\nAkiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay adaptation for the movie and is also making this his directing debut. Warner Bros. Pictures approved the picture in February 2011. The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel; composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score.\n\nCharacters not appearing in the film include Jackson Mead, Virginia's son Martin, and both Vittorio and Hardesty Marratta.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1983 American novels\n1983 fantasy novels\nAmerican alternate history novels\nNovels by Mark Helprin\nAmerican magic realism novels\nNovels set in New York City\nAmerican fantasy novels adapted into films\nWeidenfeld & Nicolson books", "machine_text": "Winter's Tale is a novel by Mark Helprin, first published in 1983.

It was also a year of important developments in various fields such as science, literature, and arts. In Europe, the year began with the defeat of Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, which forced him to abdicate and go into exile on the island of Elba. However, in March 1814, Napoleon escaped and returned to France, where he regained power for a brief period known as the Hundred Days. Despite some victories, the Emperor was defeated again at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, which marked the end of his reign and the start of a new order in Europe. In the United States, the War of 1812 ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814. The treaty resolved the conflict between the US and Great Britain, which had erupted over issues such as trade, borders, and impressment of American sailors. In the field of science, the year saw the discovery of two chemical elements: cerium and thorium. Both were isolated by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who also introduced the concept of isomerism to organic chemistry. In literature, 1814 marked the publication of two notable novels. The first was Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, which explored the themes of morality, social status, and marriage in Regency England. The second was Waverley by Sir Walter Scott, which was the first of his many historical novels set in Scotland. In the arts, the year saw the premiere of the opera \"Fidelio\" by Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna, which became one of his most admired works. It also saw the opening of the British Institution in London, which promoted the works of contemporary artists such as William Turner and John Constable. Overall, 1814 was a year of transition and change, both politically and culturally, that set the stage for the rest of the 19th century.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 34948}

Meant not for use by the Army, but instead by security forces such as police, the helmet was of similar shape to the Model 1926 helmet in use by the army. The helmet would mainly see use by the Nationalists in the conflict.\n\nDesign \n\nWhile being of similar shape to the M26 helmet, the M34 has many unique design features to distinguish itself. The shell is made of inferior material, only having  thick steel and being lighter in overall weight to the M26, giving it worse ballistic and crash characteristics to the M26. The shell generally being painted in a sand color or light brown, with surviving examples being refurbished in the 1943 order with green paint and a frontal bracket. The liner is quite different from its army cousin, instead of being attached by seven rivets around the sides of the shell, the liner is affixed using sheet metal wire from the circumference band holding the pads to the very top of the shell by means of a single rivet. The liner features four smaller leather pads as opposed to the three on the M26. Behind said pads are four paltry sized felt pads to give cushioning between the pad and liner band. The chin strap is a simple belt and buckle system for wear. Post-Civil War the helmet would be held in reserve along with previous models until the 1970s with their total replacement by the M42 helmet.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Spain M34 at brendonshelmets.weebly.com\n\nCombat helmets of Spain\nMilitary equipment introduced in the 1930s", "machine_text": "The M1934 helmet, also known as the \"casco modelo 1934,\" is a steel combat helmet that was used by the Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War. It is considered the standard helmet of the Spanish Army during that period. Designed in 1934, it was first used by the Spanish army and later by the Nationalist forces led by General Franco during the Spanish Civil War. The M1934 helmet was designed to protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets. It was made of 1.4mm thick steel and had a distinctive shape with a high crown and a flared rim that covered the ears. The helmet weighed about 1.2kg and had a leather chin strap that was secured by two buttons on either side of the helmet. The helmet's design is reminiscent of other European helmets used during that period. It was based on the French Adrian helmet which was widely used during World War I. Despite being a copy of the Adrian helmet, it had several unique features that set it apart from the original design. The M1934 helmet had a more angular and elongated shape, a higher crown, and a flared rim for extra protection. It also used a simpler liner than the Adrian helmet. The M1934 helmet remained in use throughout the Spanish Civil War. It was also used by Spanish troops during World War II, and by some Latin American countries until the 1960s. However, the helmet was eventually replaced by the M1960 helmet, which was based on the American M1 helmet. Today, the M1934 helmet is a popular collector's item, and many replicas are available for purchase. It is also featured in several war museums and memorials throughout Spain.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 63082292}

His body remained nameless until December 9, 2015. Earlier in 2015, photographs of an unknown male surfaced on a Facebook page for the John Doe. DNA testing later confirmed Callahan to be the unidentified man.\n\nDeath\nCallahan was killed in a vehicle crash, along with the driver, Michael Hager, after the Vanagon in which they were riding crashed into a pair of trees on U.S. Route 58 West around 1:30 PM on June 26, 1995. Neither man was wearing a seat belt, which likely contributed to each of their deaths. Found with Callahan's body were two scalped Grateful Dead tickets, a dollar in quarters, and a yellow Bic lighter. A letter was found, depending on sources either in Callahan's pocket or near the crash site, reading: Jason, Sorry we had to go, see ya around, call me #914-XXXX. Caroline T. & Caroline O. Bye!!!!. The phone number on the letter lacked an area code and never led to any additional clues. The letter also contained a small drawing that some speculate may be of Jerry Garcia. The tickets were dated June 24, 1995, and June 25, 1995, respectively; the Grateful Dead performed at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on these dates. Authorities were able to trace the tickets to a Pennsylvania man, but the man turned out to be a ticket reseller and could not recall the details of who he sold them to. Neither of the 'Carolines' have ever been identified.\n\nPhysical description\n\nBefore he was identified, Callahan was estimated to be between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years old; he had brown eyes with long curly brown or dark blond hair that had been dyed a reddish color. There was a tattoo of a star on his upper-left arm and another possible tattoo, which was faded, on his right arm, both of which appeared to have been amateurishly executed. He was wearing a beaded necklace and his left ear had been pierced but he was not wearing an earring. There was a scar found on his back. He was a Caucasian, had no apparent dental work as his third molars were visible, and his teeth were fairly well cared for.  At the time of the accident he was wearing a red, tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirt, Levi's jeans, white socks and black Fila running shoes.\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe vehicle's driver was identified as Michael E. Hager, 21, who may have picked Callahan up as a hitchhiker. Neither of the decedents had drugs or alcohol in their bodies and there was no discernible external cause for the crash, so authorities hypothesized that Hager could have fallen asleep at the wheel. It has been suggested that Hager may have agreed to transport Callahan because of their similar styles of dress, as they both appeared to be fans of The Grateful Dead. Authorities attempted to identify Callahan through fingerprint analysis with the aid of national databases, but were unsuccessful.\n\nWhen interviewed, Hager's family could not identify the unknown passenger, who had been reported to have been riding in Hager's Volkswagen Vanagon when he stopped to give his father a letter in Williamsburg, Virginia. However, a detective from the area stated that this claim was not accurate, and that Hager was alone when he stopped to visit his father. It is speculated that Callahan had actually been picked up between Fairfax and Gloucester, Virginia.\n\nDue to the severity of the lacerations on Callahan's face, mortuary photographs were not released to the public, although a facial reconstruction was later released. In 2012, another facial reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The man who had originally bought the tickets found in Callahan's pocket did not remember the person to whom he had sold them. At least 221 missing people were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.\n\n2015 developments\n\nIn 2015, photographs surfaced of a young man wearing similar clothes to those worn by the then-unidentified Callahan, and who bore a strong resemblance to the reconstruction images. The person in these photographs was named Jason and was described to have been a fan of the Grateful Dead. He had not been heard from since 1995 and was known to have lived in both Illinois and South Carolina. It had not yet been verified whether this was indeed the John Doe as his former roommates and other friends did not recall Jason's last name.\nThe New York Post and BuzzFeed were some of the newspapers that covered the story.\n\nIn January 2015, law enforcement conducted a DNA test to see if the John Doe was the same man as Jason Patrick Callahan, the son of a 63-year-old woman who had not seen or heard from him since June 1995, when he left home to \"follow the Grateful Dead\". Callahan, who was identified as the young man in the photographs, is described as having been a white male with wavy blond hair and brown eyes, standing between  and  tall, and weighing about . Callahan, if he was alive, would have been 38 at the time. Callahan was not reported missing by his mother until 2015.\n\nLt. Joey Crosby, spokesman for Myrtle Beach police, stated that Callahan's mother failed to file a report with police due to the nomadic nature of Grateful Dead fans. \"She attempted to report it when he went missing but didn’t know which jurisdiction to report it to,\" he said. Callahan's family also stated that they presumed he had gone to \"live on his own, elsewhere.\"\n\nAfter initial tests proved inconclusive, additional DNA testing confirmed that the body was indeed that of Jason Callahan.\n\nSee also\n List of solved missing person cases\n\nReferences\n\n1990s missing person cases\n1995 in Virginia\nDeaths by person in the United States\nEmporia, Virginia\nFormerly missing people\nGrateful Dead\nMissing person cases in Virginia\nRoad incident deaths in Virginia", "machine_text": "The Death of Jason Callahan refers to the fatal shooting incident that occurred on June 15, 2016, in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Jason Callahan, a 23-year-old man, was shot and killed by police officers during an encounter. The incident sparked outrage and protests from the community, leading to an investigation and scrutiny of police conduct. Background Jason Callahan was an African-American man who lived in Memphis, Tennessee. He had no criminal record and was known as a quiet and respectful person. On the day of his death, Callahan was reportedly suffering from a mental health crisis and was wandering the streets with a knife. Residents in the area called 911 to report the situation, and police officers responded to the scene. Incident Upon arrival, the police officers found Callahan standing on a porch, holding a knife. They ordered him to drop the knife, but he refused and continued to advance towards them. The officers claimed that they felt threatened and opened fire, killing Callahan. He was shot multiple times and died at the scene. Investigation and aftermath The shooting of Jason Callahan sparked outrage and protests from the community. Many activists and community members criticized the police officers' actions, questioning why they did not use non-lethal force to subdue the man. The shooting also shed light on the issue of police brutality and the use of deadly force against unarmed or mentally ill individuals. Following the shooting, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into the incident. The officers involved were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The investigation concluded that the officers had acted within policy and the law, and they were cleared of any wrongdoing. The death of Jason Callahan led to renewed calls for police reform and accountability in Memphis and across the country. His death is remembered as a tragic example of the ongoing issue of police violence against marginalized communities, particularly those suffering from mental health issues.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43948817}

He currently plays second on Team Jason Gunnlaugson. Wozniak is the former second for the Mike McEwen team which curled out of the Assiniboine Memorial Curling Club in Winnipeg.\n\nCareer\n\n2005–2010\nIn 2005, Wozniak joined the new Mike McEwen rink that included Justin Richter and Andrew Melnuk. For the 2006-07 season, Richter and Melnuk left the team and were replaced with Geordie Hargreaves and Adam Guenther. The team disbanded after just one season together.\n\nWozniak and McEwen joined with brothers Denni and B. J. Neufeld in 2007. In their first season together, they were a semi-finalist at the 2008 Safeway Championship, Manitoba's provincial championship. Their first Grand Slam event as a team was at the end season, at the 2008 Players' Championships. The team won two games, before being eliminated.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2008-09 season the McEwen team was ranked 7th on the CCA rankings. They had made it to three Grand Slam playoffs, and finished 4th at the 2009 Safeway Championship.\n\nDuring the 'Road to the Roar' 2009 Olympic Qualifier, the McEwen team just lost out to fellow Manitobans the Jason Gunnlaugson team in the semi-finals. Team McEwen thus missed out on the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials final despite being the favourite in that particular matchup vs Gunnlaugson.\n\nMcEwen's rink made it to his first provincial final in 2010, when he lost to Jeff Stoughton in the 2010 Manitoba provincial final. The game was being played in Steinbach, Manitoba and as the Neufeld brothers and their father have roots in Steinbach, were treated very much as the home team and crowd favourites.\n\n2010-2015: Grand Slam success and perennial provincial runner-up\nTeam McEwen started the 2010-11 season off well by defeating provincial rival Jeff Stoughton to win the World Cup of Curling and his first ever Grand Slam title in November, 2010. In part of the teams runner-up result in the provincial finals of 2010 and in part because of his 4 victories and leading the overall money winnings in the World Curling Tour season as of November 2010, the McEwen team was named as a nominee for the provincial team of the year by the Manitoba Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association.\n\nThe team continued their strong season that year by defeating provincial rival Stoughton in the semi-final of the 2011 Canadian Open. They would then go on to beat the Glenn Howard team in the extra end of the final, thus winning their second career Grand Slam and their second of that season.\n\nWozniak's rink once again made it to the Manitoba provincial this time, being the top seed (also ranked 1st in Canada). However, once again lost to Stoughton in the final of the 2011 Safeway Championship, losing by one point in the final end. The McEwen team then lost their third straight provincial final game at the 2012 Safeway Championship, this time losing to Rob Fowler, thus tying a provincial record for consecutive final losses previous set by Kerry Burtnyk from 97-99. This dubious record was avoided in 2013, when the McEwen rink failed to reach the final, but again losing to the rival Stoughton rink in the 2013 Safeway Championship semi-final. Once again, at the 2014 Safeway Championship, the team lost the final to Stoughton.\n\nDespite being ranked first in the world on both the World Curling Tour Order of Merit rankings and on the WCT money list, Wozniak lost his fifth provincial final in six years in 2015, losing to Reid Carruthers.\n\nThree Briers and team breakup \nWozniak's rink won their first provincial title in 2016, sending them to their first Brier. The Matt Dunstone rink had committed themselves to the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships, which occurred at the same time as the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier, so when the Dunstone rink beat Reid Carruthers in the semi-final, McEwen's team would go to the Brier, even if they had lost to Dunstone.\n\nIn 2017, Wozniak defended his Manitoba Championship by beating Reid Carruthers in the final. He would then better his 2016 Brier showing, going 9–2 in the round robin to enter the playoffs in first place and with hammer and choice of rocks (Brad Gushue was also 9–2 but lost first place due to losing his round robin meeting with Manitoba). He then lost 7–5 to Brad Gushue in the 1 vs. 2 game. In the semi finals against reigning Brier and World Champion Kevin Koe, they were in control for most of the game, being up 5–3 with hammer in the eighth end, but Koe made a comeback with a steal in the eighth end, two points in the tenth end, and another steal in the extra end, dropping Manitoba to the bronze medal game. They recovered to win their first Brier medal, defeating Brad Jacobs in their rematch of the 2016 bronze medal game, 7–6 in an extra end.\n\nWhile competing at the 2018 Viterra Championship, skip McEwen came down with chickenpox and was unable to play after the first game. B. J. Neufeld skipped the team, until a surprise appearance by McEwen in the final, where they lost to Carruthers. Despite the setback, they still had a chance to qualify for the 2018 Tim Hortons Brier through the wildcard game, which they won over Jason Gunnlaugson. Team McEwen had a difficult Brier and alongside Carruthers was unable to qualify for the playoffs. Following the Brier, the McEwen team announced they would be breaking up at the end of the 2017–18 season. Just days after the announcement, the McEwen team won the 2018 Elite 10 Grand Slam of Curling event, winning the top $28,000 prize money, and was the first team to go through the entire event undefeated. The Grand Slam victory was the team's seventh overall.\n\nWozniak took a few years off from men's play after Team McEwen broke up. However, he played mixed doubles with his current girlfriend Marlene Albrecht and spared for McEwen's new team. After Alex Forrest stepped away from competitive curling after the 2019–20 season, Wozniak joined the Jason Gunnlaugson rink. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, the 2021 provincial championship was cancelled. As Team Gunnlaugson were the reigning provincial champions, they were chosen to represent Manitoba at the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, the 2021 provincial championship was cancelled. As the reigning provincial champions, Team Gunnlaugson was chosen to represent Manitoba at the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier.

The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary.\n\nHistory \nLittle is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time.\n\nAt a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and ‘several estates’ to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture.\n\nFollowing the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village.\n\nThroughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing.\n\nVillage today \nIn the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.\n\nSee also\nListed buildings in Norton and Askern\n\nReferences\n\n \nNorton\nCivil parishes in South Yorkshire", "machine_text": "Norton is a small village located in South Yorkshire, England.

The name \"Norton\" comes from the Old English words \"north\" and \"tun\", meaning \"northern farmstead\". The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was later granted to the Knights Hospitaller, who held the land until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, Norton grew as a center for coal mining and iron production. The village was located near several coal mines and had easy access to the River Don, which was used for transportation. Norton's iron production reached its peak in the mid-1800s, with several ironworks located around the village. Today, Norton is a quiet village that has retained much of its historic charm. The village is home to several pubs, a primary school, and a village hall that hosts community events. The nearby Norton Priory is a popular attraction for visitors, with its picturesque gardens and historic architecture. Norton is also known for its strong sporting traditions. The village is home to several football and cricket clubs, which compete in local leagues. The Norton Sportsman's Club is a popular destination for locals, with its bar, lounge, and function rooms. In recent years, Norton has experienced some growth, with new housing developments and increased infrastructure projects.

The landscape is dominated by flat, low-lying plains and coastal marshes, and is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, including subtropical and temperate forests, savannas, and wetlands. The Austroriparian region is important for its ecological diversity and serves as an important habitat for many species, including migratory birds, alligators, and sea turtles. The region also plays a key role in the economy of the southern states, with industries including agriculture, forestry, and tourism. However, the Austroriparian region has also been subject to environmental degradation and loss of habitat due to human activities, including land use changes, deforestation, and urbanization. Efforts are currently being made to protect and conserve the region's unique ecology and wildlife, through measures such as wetland restoration and conservation of endangered species. In conclusion, the Austroriparian biome is a vital and unique region in the southeastern United States, characterized by its warm and rainy climate and rich ecological diversity. Despite the challenges it faces, efforts are being made to preserve and protect this important natural resource for future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31917334}

Reserve-Division) was a formation of the Imperial German Army in World War I.  The division was formed in September 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in October. It was part of the first wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 43rd through 54th Reserve Divisions.  The division was initially part of XXV Reserve Corps.  It was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\n\nRecruitment\n\nThe division was relatively mixed in composition.  The 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Lower Silesia.  The 230th Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised throughout Silesia.  The 231st Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Thuringia, mainly in the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg and the Prussian Province of Saxony.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was raised in Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt.  The 232nd Reserve Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 107th Infantry Division in June 1915, and new replacements for the other regiments tended to come from the Prussian Province of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick, with the 229th being described in Allied intelligence documents as becoming a Brunswick regiment.\n\nCombat chronicle\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front, entering the line in mid-October. It fought in the Battle of Łódź in November–December 1914 and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura rivers.  In July and August 1915 it fought in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive and then participated in the follow-on battles and engagements until reaching the Berezina River at the end of September.  The division was then transferred to the Western Front.  It fought in the Second Battle of Champagne in October and November 1915 and remained in the line in the Champagne until late December, when it went to Flanders and the Artois, where it remained into 1916.  It saw action in the Battle of the Somme later that year, and remained in the Somme until April 1917. In 1917, it fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw action at Cambrai.  In 1918, it fought in the German spring offensive and the Second Battle of the Marne.  It resisted the various Allied counter-offensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive, and was fighting in the Champagne and on the Meuse when World War I ended.  In 1918, Allied intelligence rated the division as second class, and noted its tough fighting in numerous battles.\n\nOrder of battle on formation\n\nThe 50th Reserve Division was initially organized as a square division, with essentially the same organization as the reserve divisions formed on mobilization.

It was Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson first success and was the show that brought them to fame. The concept involved Filip and Fredrik making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups. The jokes were of a rather unusual, sometimes experimental, nature and some viewers took offense, feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people.\n\nThe show made the headlines due to a segment called \"the Swedish Nazi-reference championship\" where they fooled singer and former Expedition Robinson-star Emma Andersson into an interview where they made as many Nazi-references as possible and observed her reactions. This included jokes such as naming the show they claimed to work for \"Treblinka\", claiming that Leni Riefenstahl was a modern director of music-videos, that Joseph Goebbels was a DJ whose music resembled Andersson's, and dozens of other references to the Third Reich and the Holocaust. Throughout the interview, Andersson wore a T-shirt with the text \"Treblinka - Class of '45\". Andersson didn't seem to react at all on tape. She later claimed that her reactions were edited out in order to make fun of her - a claim Fredrik Wikingsson has later refuted.\n\nThis caused a major controversy as many felt that the whole concept was mean-spirited and in bad taste. Tabloids reported the segment as a scandal and painted Andersson as a violated victim. Filip and Fredrik defended the segment by claiming that it is important to expose ignorance among public persons who young people might look up to. In the end, TV4 was fined by the Granskningsnämnden för radio och TV, who argued that, since Andersson was not a political person, the segment was intrusive to her privacy and integrity.\n\nIn a similar vein, the pair staged an interview with an openly homophobic priest, only to kiss each other in front of him in the middle of the interview.\n\nReferences\n\nTV4 (Sweden) original programming\nSwedish comedy television series", "machine_text": "Ursäkta röran (vi bygger om) is a common phrase used in Sweden, which translates to \"Please excuse the mess (we're renovating).\" It is often seen on signs or printed on construction barriers to inform onlookers that a building or space is undergoing renovation.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Projective line\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, a projective line is, roughly speaking, the extension of a usual line by a point called a point at infinity. The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no \"parallel\" case).\n\nThere are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field K, commonly denoted P1(K), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional K-vector space. This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space.\n\nThe projective line over the reals is a manifold; see real projective line for details.\n\nHomogeneous coordinates\nAn arbitrary point in the projective line P1(K) may be represented by an equivalence class of homogeneous coordinates, which take the form of a pair\n\nof elements of K that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor λ:\n\nLine extended by a point at infinity \nThe projective line may be identified with the line K extended by a point at infinity. More precisely,\nthe line K may be identified with the subset of P1(K) given by\n\nThis subset covers all points in P1(K) except one, which is called the point at infinity:\n\nThis allows to extend the arithmetic on K to P1(K) by the formulas\n\nTranslating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when  does not occur:\n\nExamples\n\nReal projective line\n\nThe projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line.  It may also be thought of as the line K together with an idealised point at infinity ∞ ; the point connects to both ends of K creating a closed loop or topological circle. \n\nAn example is obtained by projecting points in R2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup \n\nCompare the extended real number line, which distinguishes ∞ and −∞.\n\nComplex projective line: the Riemann sphere\nAdding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere. Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the Gauss sphere). It is in constant use in complex analysis, algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface.\n\nFor a finite field\n\nThe projective line over a finite field Fq of q elements has  points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates , q of these points have the form:\n for each  in ,\n\nand the remaining point at infinity may be represented as [1 : 0].\n\nSymmetry group\nQuite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in K acts on the projective line P1(K). This group action is transitive, so that P1(K) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL2(K) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations. Transitivity says that there exists a homography that will transform any point Q to any other point R. The point at infinity on P1(K) is therefore an artifact of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates\n\nexpress a one-dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point  lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point  to any other, and it is in no way distinguished.\n\nMuch more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points Qi for  to any other 3-tuple Ri of distinct points (triple transitivity). This amount of specification 'uses up' the three dimensions of PGL2(K); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive. The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio. Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL2(K) action on a projective line, replacing \"field\" by \"KT-field\" (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and \"PGL\" by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.\n\nAs algebraic curve\nThe projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve. From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P1(K) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If K is algebraically closed, it is the unique such curve over K, up to rational equivalence. In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over K to a conic C, which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if C has a point defined over K; geometrically such a point P can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence..\n\nThe function field of the projective line is the field K(T) of rational functions over K, in a single indeterminate T. The field automorphisms of K(T) over K are precisely  the group PGL2(K) discussed above. \n\nAny function field K(V) of an algebraic variety V over K, other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with K(T). From the point of view of birational geometry, this means that there will be a rational map from V to P1(K), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P1(K), and the inverse image of a typical point P will be of dimension . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis, and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide.\n\nIf V is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve C presented 'over' P1(K). Assuming C is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with K(C)), it can be shown that such a rational map from C to P1(K) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a double point where a curve crosses itself may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification. \n\nMany curves, for example hyperelliptic curves, may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, the genus then depends only on the type of ramification.\n\nA rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space Pn is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence), given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as\n\n[1 : t : t2 : ... : tn].\n\nSee twisted cubic for the first interesting case.\n\nSee also\n\n Projectively extended real line\n Cross-ratio\n Projective range\n Möbius transformations\n Algebraic curve\n Projective line over a ring\n\nReferences\n\nAlgebraic curves\nProjective geometry", "machine_text": "The projective line is a fundamental concept in algebraic geometry, which is the study of geometric shapes and their underlying algebraic structure. It is a one-dimensional space that is obtained from the real number line by adding a point at infinity. This construction greatly enhances the power of geometric reasoning by allowing infinitely distant points to be considered as finite entities. The projective line has a number of interesting properties that make it a useful tool in many branches of mathematics, including topology, complex analysis, and number theory. For example, every two points on the projective line determine a unique line in a projective plane, and every three points determine a unique projective quadratic. The projective line can also be used to define the concept of homogeneity, which is a key idea in many areas of mathematics. A set of objects is said to be homogeneous if they can be transformed into one another by a certain group of transformations. In the case of the projective line, homogeneity means that any two points can be transformed into any other two points by a projective transformation. Projective geometry is closely related to projective algebra, which is the study of algebraic equations in terms of projective geometry. This involves representing algebraic equations as points and curves on the projective line or plane, and using geometric techniques to solve them. Overall, the projective line is a powerful and versatile tool that plays a central role in many areas of mathematics. Its ability to transform finite objects into infinite ones and bring distant points together into a common space makes it an indispensable tool for geometric reasoning.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 398578}

It was founded by Nimbarka, a Telugu Brahmin yogi and philosopher. It propounds the Vaishnava Bhedabheda theology of Dvaitadvaita (dvaita-advaita) or dualistic non-dualism. Dvaitadvaita states that humans are both different and non-different from Isvara, God or Supreme Being. Specifically, this Sampradaya is a part of Krishnaism—Krishna-centric traditions.\n\nGuru Parampara\n\nNimbarka Sampradaya is also known as Kumāra Sampradāya, Hamsa Sampradāya, and Sanakādi Sampradāya. According to tradition, the Nimbarka Sampradaya Dvaita-advaita philosophy was revealed by  to Sri Sanakadi Bhagawan, one of the Four Kumaras; who passed it to Sri Narada Muni; and then on to Nimbarka. The Four Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana, and Sanat Kumāra, are traditionally regarded as the four mind-born sons of Lord Brahmā. They were created by Brahmā in order to advance creation, but chose to undertake lifelong vows of celibacy (brahmacarya), becoming renowned yogis, who requested from Brahma the boon of remaining perpetually five years old. Śrī Sanat Kumāra Samhitā, a treatise on the worship of , is attributed to the brothers, just like the Śrī Sanat Kumāra Tantra, which is part of the Pancarātra literature.\n\nIn the creation of this universe as narrated by the  literature, Śrī Nārada Muni is the younger brother of the Four Kumāras, who took initiation from his older brothers. Their discussions as guru and disciple are recorded in the  with a famous conversation in the , and in the Śrī Nārada  and the Pañcarātra literature.\n\nNārada Muni is recorded as main teacher in all four of the  Sampradāyas. According to tradition, he initiated Śrī Nimbārkācārya into the sacred 18-syllabled Śrī Gopāla Mantra (Klim Krishnaya Govindaya Gopijanavallabhaya Svaha), and introduced him to the philosophy of the Yugala upāsana, the devotional worship of the divine couple . According to tradition, this was the first time that Śrī Rādhā  were worshipped together by anyone on earth other than the Gopis of . Śrī Nārada Muni then taught Nimbarka the essence of devotional service in the Śrī Nārada Bhakti Sūtras. Śrī Nimbārkācārya already knew the Vedas,  and the rest of the scriptures, but perfection was found in the teachings of Śrī Nārada Muni.\n\nNimbarka\n\nDating\nNimbarka is conventionally dated at the 12th or 13th century, but this dating has been questioned, suggesting that Nimbarka lived somewhat earlier than Shankara, in the 6th or 7th century CE.\n\nAccording to Roma Bose, Nimbarka lived in the 13th century, on the presupposition that Śrī Nimbārkāchārya was the author of the work Madhvamukhamardana. Bhandarkar has placed him after Ramanuja, suggesting 1162 AD as the date of his demise. S.N.Dasgupta dated Nimbarka to around middle of 14th century, while S. A. A. Rizvi assigns a date of c.1130–1200 AD.\n\nAccording to Satyanand, Bose's dating of the 13th century is an erroneous attribution. Malkovsky, following Satyanand, notes that in Bhandarkar's own work it is clearly stated that his dating of Nimbarka was an approximation based on an extremely flimsy calculation; yet most scholars chose to honour his suggested date, even until modern times. According to Malkovsky, Satyanand has convincingly demonstrated that Nimbarka and his immediate disciple Shrinivasa flourished well before Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE), arguing that Shrinivasa was a contemporary, or just after Sankaracarya (early 8th century). According to Ramnarace, summarising the available research, Nimbarka must be dated in the 7th century CE.\n\nTraditional accounts\nAccording to the Bhavishya Purana, and his eponymous tradition, the Nimbārka Sampradāya, Śrī Nimbārkāchārya appeared in the year 3096 BCE, when the grandson of Arjuna was on the throne. According to tradition, Nimbārka was born in Vaidūryapattanam, the present-day Mungi Village, Paithan in East Maharashtra. His parents were Aruṇa Ṛṣi and Jayantī Devī. Together, they migrated to Mathurā and settled at what is now known as Nimbagrāma (Neemgaon), situated between Barsānā and Govardhan.\n\nSri Hansa Bhagwan \nIn Hinduism, the first guru of the Nimbarka Sampradaya is Lord Sri Hansa Bhagwan, who himself is one of the twenty-four incarnations of Lord Vishnu. At the beginning of creation, in the Satya Yuga, Lord Vishnu Himself took the form of a quadrangle, joined conch shells, chakras, maces, and lotuses, and descended to the sage Sankadi, the son of Brahma, in the name of Hansabata.\n\nTeachings\n\nDvaita-advaita\nThe Nimbarka Sampradaya is based on Nimbarka's Bhedabheda philosophy, duality and nonduality at the same time, or dualistic non-dualism.\n\nAccording to Nimbarka, there are three categories of existence, namely Isvara (God, Divine Being); cit (jiva, the individual soul); and acit (lifeless matter). Cit and acit are different from Isvara, in the sense that they have attributes (Guna) and capacities (Swabhaava), which are different from those of Isvara. At the same time, cit and acit are not different from Isvara, because they cannot exist independently of him. Isvara is independent and exists by himself, while cit and acit exist in dependence upon him. Difference means a kind of existence which is separate but dependent, (para-tantra-satta-bhava); while non-difference means impossibility of separate existence (svatantra-satta-bhava).\n\nAccording to Nimbarka, the relation between Brahman, on the one hand, and the souls (cit) and universe (acit) on the other, is a relation of natural difference-non-difference (svabhavika-bhedabheda). Nimbarka equally emphasises both difference and non-difference, as against Ramanuja, who makes difference subordinate to non-difference, in as much as, for him cit and acit do not exist separately from Brahman, but are its body or attributes.\n\nNimbarka accepts parinamavada, the idea that the world is a real transformation (parinama) of Brahman, to explain the cause of animate and inanimate world, which he says exist in a subtle form in the various capacities (saktis), which belong to Brahman in its natural condition. Brahman is the material cause of the universe, in the sense that Brahman brings the subtle rudiments into the gross form, by manifesting these capacities.\n\nFor Nimbarka the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopi's, or cowherdesses, of the celestial Vrindavan. Devotion, according to Nimbarka, consists in prapatti, or self-surrender.\n\nSri Nimbarkacharya, on the  worship of the divine couple, in\nDasha Shloki (verse 6):\n\nCit (Jiva)\nThe cit or individual soul is of the nature of knowledge (jnana-svarupa); it is able to know without the help of the sense-organs and it is in this sense that words like prajnana-ghanah svayamjyotih jnanamayah etc. as applied to jiva are to be understood. The jiva is the knower also; and he can be both knowledge and the possessor of knowledge at the same time, just as the sun is both light and the source of light. Thus the soul, who is knowledge, and his attribute, knowledge, though they are both identical as knowledge, can be at the same time different and related as the qualified () and the quality (), just as the sun and his light, though identical as light (taijasa), are still different from each other. Thus there is both a difference and a non-difference between the  and ; and the extreme similarity between them implies, not necessarily their absolute identity, but only a non-perception of their difference.\n\nThe jiva is also ego (ahamarthah). This ego continues to persist not only in the state of deep sleep, (because our consciousness immediately after getting up from sleep has the form slept happily or knew nothing) but also in the state of liberation. It even belongs to the Parabrahman. Hence it is that Krishna refers to Himself so frequently in the first person in the Gita, of which the chief object is thus Purusottama, who is omniscient and at the same time non-different from the ego or asmadartha.\n\nThe jiva is also essentially active (kartr). This quality belongs to it in all its conditions, even after release. But the kartrtva is not independent. The jiva is also enjoyer (bhoktr) essentially in all its conditions.\n\nFor his knowledge and activity, however, the jiva depends on Hari; thus, though resembling Him in being intelligent and knower, he is at the same time distinguished from him by his dependence. This quality of dependence or of being controlled (niyamyatva) is the very nature of jiva even in the state of release, just as niyamyatva or the quality of being the controller, forms the eternal nature of Isvara.\n\nThe jiva is atomic in size; at the same time his attribute, knowledge, is omnipresent, which makes it possible that he can experience pleasure and pain in any part of the body, just as, for instance, the light of a lamp can spread far and wide and illumine objects away from the lamp. The Jivas are different and in different bodies, and so are infinite in number.\n\nAcit (the jagat)\nThe acit is of three different kinds: viz. prakrta, aprakrta, and kala. Prakrta, or what is derived from Prakrti, the primal matter, aprakrta is defined negatively as that which is not the product of prakrti, but its real nature is not clearly brought out. These three categories in their subtle forms are as eternal as the cit or the individual souls.\n\n[Nimbarka does not explain what exactly the aprakrta is, nor does he define kala more precisely, beyond noticing, as pointed out above, that the aprakrta and the kala are species of the acit. But, Purusottamacarya of the Nimbarka school has, in his Vedantaratna-manjusa, described acit aprakrta as the material cause of the dhama (celestial abode) of Brahman and the bodies and ornaments etc.of Brahman and his associates.]\n\nPrakrti, or the primal matter-the stuff of the entire universe is real and eternal like the individual souls, and like them, though eternal and unborn, has yet Brahman for its cause. It consists of the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, such as prakrit, mahat, ahankara etc. (just similar to 24 principles of the Sankhyas).\n\nPractices - the five sadhanas\nThe basic practice consists of the worship of Sri Radha Madhav, with Sri Radha being personified as the inseparable part of Sri Krishna. Nimbarka Sampradaya became the first Krishnaite tradition in late medieval time. Nimbarka refers to five methods to salvation, namely karma (ritual action); vidya (knowledge); upasana or dhyana (meditation); prapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion); Gurupasatti (devotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna).\n\nKarma (ritual action)\nPerformed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one's varna and asrama (phase of life) thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation).\n\nVidya (knowledge)\n\nNot as a subordinate factor of karma but also not as an independent means for everyone; only for those inclined to spending vast lengths of time in scriptural study and reflection on deeper meanings.\n\nUpasana or dhyana (meditation)\nIt is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, i.e. meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the sentient. Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non-sentient. Final one is meditation on Lord Himself, as different from the sentient and non-sentient. This is again not an independent means to Salvation for all, as only those qualified to perform the upasana (with Yajnopavitam) can perform this Sadhana.\n\nPrapatti (surrender to the Lord/devotion)\nDevotion and self-surrender to God as Shri Radha Krsna. This method of attaining Salvation, known as Prapatti Sadhana, contains elements of all the other means, and is most importantly, available to all. Men, women, foreigners, all classes and castes (or non-castes) are permitted to seek liberation through this, the most important Sadhana. It is referred to as Sadhana (or Apara) Bhakti – devotion through regulations. This in turn leads to Para Bhakti – the highest devotion characterised by Madhurya Rasa – the sweet emotions of devotion experienced by those perfected in Sadhana Bhakti.\n\nThe Maha-mantra Radhe Krishna of Nimbarka Sampradaya is as follows:\n\nGurupasatti\nDevotion and self-surrender to guru. Best realised as a part in Prapatti, and not as an independent means, although it can be so.\n\nSri Nimbarka made the \"Bhasya\"  (commentary in which alle the words of the verses are used, in contradistinction to a tika, which is a more free commentary) of the Brahmasutra on his Dvaitadvaita Vedanta (Principle of Dualism-Nondualism) in his famous book \"Vedanta Parijata Sourabha\".\n\nLiterature\nSri Nimbarkacharya wrote the following books:\n Vedanta Parijat Saurabh– Commentary on the Brahma Sutras\n Sadachar Prakasha– a treatise on karma kanda\n Commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita\n Rahasya Shodasi- Sri Gopala Mantra explained\n Prapanna Kalpa Valli-Sri Mukunda Mantra explained\n Prapatti Chintamani–  On Supreme surrender\n Pratah Smarana Stotram\n Dasa Shloki or Kama Dhenu– Ten Verses\n Savisesh Nirvisesh\n Sri Krishna Stavam\n\nNimbarka Sampradaya Devacāryas\n\nSri Bhatta\n\nAs themes of Radha and Krishna gained popularity, Keshava Kashmiri's disciple Sribhatta in the 15th century, amplified Nimbarka's insights and brought Radha Krishna once more into the theological forefront through the medium of brajbhasha. A range of poets and theologians who flourished in the milieu of Vrindavana, Vallabha, Surdas, rest of Vallabha's disciples, Svami Haridas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Six Goswamis of Vrindavana were influenced in some manner by Sribhatta. The theological insights by this particular teacher were developed by his disciple Harivyasa, whose works reveal not only the theology of Radha Krisna and the sakhis the nitya nikunja lilas of goloka vrindavana, but also embody a fairly developed vedantic theory propagating the unique branch of bedhaabedha philosophy, ultimately the legacy of Nimbarka's original re-envisaging role of Radha.\n\nSvāmī Harivyāsa Devacārya (c.1470-1540 CE)\nSvāmī Harivyāsa Devacārya (c.1470-1540 CE), the 35th leader, reformed the tradition. He was given the śālagrāma deity known as Śrī Sarveśvara that was handed down through time it is believed from Nimbārka himself. He anointed twelve of his senior disciples to lead missions throughout the land. The most famous are Svāmī Paraśurāma Devācārya (c.1525-1610 CE) and Svāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl. 16th century).\n\nSvāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl.16th century CE)\nSvāmī Svabhūrāma Devācārya (fl.16th century CE) was born in Budhiya Village, outside Jagadhri and Yamunanagar near Kurukshetra in modern Haryana, India. He established over 52 temples in Punjab, Haryana and Vraja during his lifetime; his current followers are found mostly in , Haryana, Punjab, Bengal, Rajasthan, Orissa, Assam, Sikkim, Bihar, other regions in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, also in significant numbers in Nepal.\n\nIn his sub-lineage, there are many branches. Notable saints of this sub-branch include:\n Saint Swami Chatur Chintamani Nagaji Maharaj, who started the Vraja Parikrama. This tradition has been continuously maintained over 528 years by the Acharyas of the Svabhurāma-Dwara (sub-lineage).\n\nRamdas Kathiababa  (fl.54th century CE)\nThat saint was the 53rd Acharya of our community, Sri Sri 108 Swami Devdasji Kathia Babaji Maharaj. Sri Sri Devdasji Maharaj was a great man of Yogishwar Siddha. He was buried in Ekasan for six months and had nothing to eat even though he was not in the grave. After taking sannyasa, Kathia's father was named \"Ramdas\". From the time of Guru's presence, he was fully engaged in Guruseva. His guru started teaching him astanga yoga, all kinds of mantras and their application method with Hatha Yoga. Gurudev, however, did not make the mistake of testing the disciple from time to time. Sometimes he would starve, sometimes he would have a very tasty meal, sometimes he would test Sri Sri Ramdasji with inaudible abuse or beatings for no reason. Once Sri Sri Devdasji showed him a seat and asked him to sit there, instructing him, \"You will sit here in this seat until I come back. Don't leave your seat and go anywhere else. \" Gurudev came eight days later. Sri Ramdasji sat in that seat for eight consecutive days, did not eat anything, nor did he defecate. When Gurudev returned on the eighth day, Sri Ramdasji got up from his seat and prostrated himself before Gurudev. Seeing this devotion and determination towards obeying his guru, Gurudev was very pleased and said, \"In this way one has to obey the guru's orders. God is pleased when the Guru's orders are obeyed wholeheartedly. \"came to Vrindavan and made his first monastery there. He was succeeded by Swami Santadas Kathiababa\n\nSantadas Kathiababa (fl.55th century CE)\nSantadas Kathiababa was a Nimbarka philosopher, Hindu religious guru, Nimbarka Vaishnava and chief mahanta, a spiritual leader and a leading disciple of Sri Sri 108 Ramdas Kathiababa of the Nimbarka Sampradaya.\nAt the place of Jagannath Ghat, Gangotri, the source of the Ganges, floated in front of him and Har-Parvati, who was present in it, visited himLord Shankara then gave him a monosyllabic seed mantra and by chanting that mantra he would gain Sadguru - with such an assurance they disappeared. Then the scene of that Gomukh Gangotri in the Himalayas also disappeared. He started chanting that seed mantra with great devotion. In search of a good guru, he went on various pilgrimages and gradually he arrived at the Prayag Kumbh Mela with a friend. Although his interview here was with his future Gurudev Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj, he was skeptical about whether he would take him seriously. He saw some miracles of Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj[4] but could not be completely without doubt. .Then he went to Vrindavan in the month of Chaitra and this time he was almost disappointed to see his work from very close to Kathia Babaji Maharaj. Far from considering Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj as a Brahmajna Mahapurusha, Sri Tarakishore Babu considered him to be an ordinary old village saint. But when his miraculous deeds came to mind, he could not understand exactly what was wrong with his decision. With this skeptical mind he returned to Calcutta. One night in Calcutta, when he was sleeping on the roof of his house, he suddenly woke up and sat up. He saw Sri Sri Ramdas Kathia Babaji Maharaj coming towards Akash Marg and in a short time he came down to him on that roof. After that, Kathia Babaji Maharaj gave a mantra in his ear and left again. There was no other doubt in the mind of Sri Tara Kishore Sharma Chowdhury about Sri Sri Kathia Babaji Maharaj. All his hesitations were immediately dispelled and he considered himself fortunate to have taken refuge in the desired Sadguru. Even after being miraculously initiated in this way, he formally took wife's initiation in Vrindavan on the day of Janmashtami in 1894.\n Swami Brindaban Bihari Das Mahanta Maharaj at Kathia Baba ka Ashram, Shivala, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh and Sukhchar, 24-Parganas (North), West Bengal, who has undertaken projects for orphans and aged persons, building schools and elderly care homes.

The sampradaya is based on the principles of Dvaitadvaita (dualism-nondualism), which holds that the absolute reality is both different and non-different from the individual souls. Nimbarka, also known as Bhaskara Acharya, was born in the 13th century in modern-day Rajasthan, India. He was a disciple of the great philosopher Ramanuja, who founded one of the other four Vaishnava sampradayas. Nimbarka's philosophical teachings were influenced by both Ramanuja's Vishistadvaita and Shankara's Advaita schools of thought. The Nimbarka Sampradaya is rooted in the devotion of Radha and Krishna, the divine couple who are worshipped as the ultimate reality. The sampradaya places great importance on the practice of bhakti yoga as a means of attaining union with the divine. Through devotion, the individual soul becomes one with the divine, experiencing the ultimate truth and liberation from the material world. In addition to the teachings of Nimbarka, the sampradaya also recognizes the contributions of other spiritual leaders and scholars, such as Sanaka, Sanandana, and Sanatana, who were believed to have received the knowledge of the sampradaya from Narada, the great sage and musician. The Nimbarka Sampradaya has a rich tradition of devotional poetry, music, and art. The famous poet and saint Surdas, who composed the Bhaktamala and the Sur Sagar, was a follower of the sampradaya. The sampradaya also has a number of temples and ashrams dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna. Today, the Nimbarka Sampradaya has followers in India and around the world. It continues to be an important tradition within the larger Vaishnava community, and its teachings of devotion and union with the divine remain as relevant today as they were centuries ago.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11310737}

England, Scotland, and Wales compete as three nations in bridge, Denmark and Faroe Islands compete as two, but they jointly constitute Great Britain and Denmark Olympic teams. Otherwise Andorra, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, and Moldova are in Olympic Europe but do not compete in world bridge. Lebanon is in bridge Europe and Olympic Asia.\n\nThe European \"Small Federations\" competition, established 2007, is restricted to national teams from federations with no more than 500 members. Twelve to sixteen teams have participated in the first three renditions. Nineteen of the 49 EBL nations appear to be eligible.\n\nAt the other extreme, France and Netherlands account for half of the 384,000 players. Five other nations constitute another 30%: Italy, Germany, England, Denmark, and Sweden. Thus the seven largest bridge nations have 80% of Europe's registered bridge players.\n\nForty of the 49 EBL nations entered at least one national team in the latest European Team Championships (2010): 38 in the Open category, 28 Women, and 23 Senior teams.\n\nChampionships\n\nPerhaps the primary EBL responsibility is to conduct those championships which accord the title European champion.\n\nNational teams\n\nThe marquee championships for national teams are now biennial in even years.

Previously and first in 1932 it was organized by the International Bridge League, predecessor of the World Bridge Federation (est. 1958).\n\nThe Open flight was first contested in 1932, the Women in 1935, and the Senior in 1995.\n\nOther\n\nThe European Open Bridge Championships are biennial in odd years since 2003.\n\nThe European Champions' Cup annually since 2002.\n\nThe EBL organizes youth events annually in July, for youth teams and pairs that represent EBL member countries.\n\nThe European Small Federations Trophy is contested by teams representing bridge nations with up to 500 members.\n\nControversy\n\nIn the 2021 European championships, Italy included Fulvio Fantoni on its team, a player previously sanctioned for cheating. In protest, the remaining national teams refused to play against the Italians and subsequently forfeited their games.\n\nSeveral national bridge associations indicated support for the forfeitures. The Italian Bridge Federation vigorously protested the actions of the forfeiting players and their National Bridge Organizations (NBO) urging that the European Bridge League expel them from the tournament.\n\nSee also\n American Contract Bridge League\n List of bridge governing bodies\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n European Bridge League\n\nContract bridge governing bodies\nSports organizations established in 1947\n1947 establishments in Denmark", "machine_text": "The European Bridge League (EBL) is a non-profit organization that oversees the game of bridge in Europe.

Vishnupant Damle's work as a filmmaker was revolutionary, especially in the context of Indian cinema during the 1930s. He was one of the first filmmakers in India to experiment with sound and sync sound, creating films such as \"Sant Tukaram\" (1936) and \"Duniya Na Mane\" (1937), which are still revered for their technical innovations. One of Vishnupant Damle's most famous films was \"Ayodhyecha Raja\" (1932), a retelling of the Ramayana epic which is considered a classic of early Indian cinema. The film's lavish sets, elaborate costumes and music made it a commercial and critical success, and it paved the way for many other mythological films in India. In addition to his work as a filmmaker, Vishnupant Damle was also a prolific producer, producing films such as \"Jeevan Naiya\" (1936) and \"Kangan\" (1939), which were both critical and commercial successes. He was also active in the Marathi theatre scene and directed a number of plays.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Open wagon\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Open wagons (trucks in the UK) form a large group of railway goods wagons designed primarily for the transportation of bulk goods that are not moisture-retentive and can usually be tipped, dumped or shovelled. The International Union of Railways (UIC) distinguishes between ordinary wagons (Class E/UIC-type 5) and special wagons (F/6). Open wagons often form a significant part of a railway company's goods wagon fleet; for example, forming just under 40% of the Deutsche Bahn's total goods wagon stock in Germany.\n\nUIC standard goods wagons\nSince the 1960s, the majority of goods wagons procured by European railway administrations have been built to standards laid down by, or based on, those established by the UIC. In addition to open wagons the table also shows wagons with opening roofs (Class T), whose design is based on open wagons.\n\nClass E – Ordinary open high-sided wagons\n\nThese wagons have a level floor and solid sides with at least one door on each side. They are mainly used for transporting bulk goods, coal, scrap, steel, wood and paper. The majority of wagons have folding sides and end walls, otherwise they are given the letters l (fixed sides) or o (fixed end walls). Wagons may have one or two folding end walls. \nSteel rings enable ropes, nets or covers to be attached to secure the load.\n\nSome of these wagons can also be completely tipped over, in other words, at certain places they can be lifted up and emptied by being turned about their longitudinal axis. This requires a very robust underframe. Sometimes the wagons are fitted with rotatable couplings so that they do not have to be individually uncoupled.\n\nIn 1998 the DB had about 16,000 four-axle Class E wagons. They have increasingly retired their twin-axled E wagons since the 1990s and they are now rarely seen.\n\nClass F – Special open high-sided wagons\nThe majority of these are self-discharging wagons which use gravity-unloading (hopper cars and saddle-bottomed wagons), but in addition there are also:\n Side-tipping wagons (box tip, trough-tip or side-tip wagon),\n Bucket wagon, other open wagons without side doors\n\nIn 1998, the Deutsche Bahn had about 12,000 hopper wagons, 10,000 saddle-bottomed wagons and 1,000 side-tipping wagons. In addition to hopper and saddle-bottomed wagons there were also wagons with opening roofs.\n\nTypical loads for these wagons are all sorts of bulk goods, like coal, coke, ore, sand or gravel. Because bulk goods are often moved in large quantities, these wagons are frequently used in so-called unit or block trains that only comprise one type of wagon and only shift one type of product from the dispatcher to the recipient.\n\nHopper wagons\n   \n\nHopper wagons can only be unloaded by gravity with no external assistance and are therefore also classed as self-discharging wagons. The majority may be filled, when at rail or road level, by high-level discharge chutes (whose ends are more than 70 cm above the top of the rails) or conveyor belts. Because a controlled amount of the load can be discharged at any place the wagons may be sent anywhere and are even used individually. Railway companies also use hoppers as departmental wagons in maintenance of way trains for ballasting the track.\n\nSince the 1990s there has been a trend for new hopper wagons to be built as bogie wagons which have not yet been standardised by the UIC.\n\nGallery\n\nSaddle-bottomed wagons\n\nSaddle-bottomed wagons are large-volume hoppers are exclusively unloaded by gravity and are therefore classed as self-discharging hoppers. Unlike normal hopper wagons, however, their discharge cannot be controlled and the entire load must be dropped. To unload the flaps on the side swing out allowing the load to empty. This is aided by the floor which slopes downwards on both sides like a gable roof. The discharging chutes on either side are relatively high up. These wagons are frequently seen in unit trains for transporting bulk goods such as coal or mineral ore from mines or ports to steelworks or power stations.\n\nThe most modern type of four axle saddle-bottomed wagon in the DB is the four axle Falns 121 with a loading volume of . It was built from 1992 in several batches. By February 2008 another 100 of these wagons were to have been delivered to the DB and another 300 by 2010. These latest wagons will have an axle load of  and an unladen weight of no more than , resulting in a load limit of .\n\nSide-tipping wagons\nSide-tipping wagons have hydraulic, pneumatic or electric tipping equipment, that enables the wagon body to be lifted on one side. Depending on the design, they may be tipped to both sides or just one side only. In order to prevent wagons from falling over during the tipping operation, some are equipped with track pinch bars with which they can be securely anchored to the trackbed. These wagons are often seen in unit trains being used to remove excavated material from major construction sites.\n\nSpecialized wagons\n\nLorry or mine car\n\nA lorry or mine car is an open railroad car (gondola) with a tipping trough, used in mining.  It is known in the UK as a tippler or chaldron wagon, and in the US as a mine car.\n\nChaldrons\n\nThe first railway bulk-cargo gondolas, the first freight wagons, were the chaldron cars of the early coal-carrying plateways.  These were relatively short in length and tall in proportion, with a tapered body that widened upwards, above the wheels.  Once locomotive haulage began, the unstable and top-heavy nature of this design became a problem with increasing speeds and later wagons became lower and longer.  The chaldron shape survived in a few cases, such as low-speed working around a large factory sites including steelworks.\n\nModalohr road trailer carriers\n\nModalohrs are specialized wagons for carrying road trailers and road tractors on the AFF route from France to Italy and Luxembourg to Spain and vice versa; there are plans to expand this service. A deck between the bogies (trucks) pivots (swings) 30°, allowing the trailers to be loaded from the sides. The cars are built by Lohr Industrie.\n\nIntermodal open wagons\n\nSee also\n\n Austauschbauart\n Class U special wagon\n German railway wagon classes\n German state railway norms\n Kangourou wagon\n Kriegsbauart\n Lowmac\n Pocket wagon\n Quarry tub\n Slate waggon\n Verbandsbauart\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Class Ua side-tippers in the Czech archives at parostroj.net\n DB goods wagon catalogue\n Flexiwaggon\n\nFreight rolling stock\nInternational Union of Railways", "machine_text": "Open wagon, also known as an open-top wagon or gondola wagon, is a type of railway freight wagon which has no roof, sides, or ends and is used to transport materials that do not require protection from the weather. It is one of the oldest types of railway wagons and has been in use since the early days of railways. Open wagons are typically large and sturdy and capable of carrying heavy loads of bulk goods such as ore, coal, or grain. Design and Construction Open wagons are usually constructed from steel or wood and are equipped with a floor made of wooden planks or steel plates. The sides of an open wagon are usually low and made of stakes or side panels to prevent the load from falling off the wagon during transit. The use of a tarpaulin to cover the load is common in some cases, especially when transporting goods that are sensitive to weather conditions. The size and carrying capacity of an open wagon vary depending upon its use and the type of goods transported. Uses Open wagons are primarily used for transporting bulk goods which do not require protection from the elements. The most common commodities transported in open wagons are coal, mineral ores, grains, and construction materials such as gravel and sand. The low sides of an open wagon make it easy to load and unload goods using cranes and other materials handling equipment. Types There are several types of open wagons designed for specific purposes. Flat wagons are used to transport long and heavy items such as steel girders and large pipes. Hopper wagons are used for transporting bulk goods such as sand, cement, and grains. Sliding wall wagons have sliding sidewalls that can be opened to make loading and unloading easier. Safety and regulations Open wagons are subject to strict safety regulations to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of railway workers and the public. The wagons must be inspected regularly to ensure that they are in good condition and can safely carry the load. The load must be secured properly to prevent it from falling off the wagon during transit. Operators must also follow safety guidelines when loading, unloading, and transporting goods in open wagons. Conclusion Open wagons play a vital role in the transportation of bulk goods worldwide. They are efficient and cost-effective as they can transport large quantities of goods in a single trip. The use of open wagons has been decreasing in recent times due to the increased use of specialized wagons and containers. However, they continue to remain an important part of the railway freight transport system.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18961310}

It received this conservation status because the waterbody has remained close to its natural state due to its steep river banks and is a habitat for a range of rare plants and animals. It covers an area of . In addition to the section of river it includes an oxbow lake, a tributary, hedgerows, wooded river banks and slopes, rich in herbs, and small ponds.\n\nThe Schwentine valley, in which the nature reserve lies, was formed from a chain of dead-icefields that were left behind after the last ice age. After they had melted a chain of dammed-up lakes was formed and, when the water forced its way out, the present river valley of the Schwentine emerged.\n\nFauna \nAmongst the animal species occurring in the nature reserve are fish such as the trout, bleak, burbot and stickleback. It is also home to the blue-tailed damselfly and the emerald dragonfly. Native bird species include the kingfisher, grey wagtail and white-throated dipper. The first two breed in the nature reserve, whilst the dipper only rests and overwinters. In the ponds amongst the grasslands there are amphibians like the common toad, smooth newt, water frog, common frog and moor frog as well as grass snakes. The hedgerows are used by many animals including the red-backed shrike, great spotted woodpecker and tawny owl.\n\nFlora \nIn the near-natural riparian woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring yellow wood anemone, bulbous corydalis and lesser celandine blossom in the woods. Opposite-leaved golden saxifrage and primrose grow on the wetter tracts of the nature reserve.

It is situated near the city of Kiel and is a popular tourist destination because of its scenic beauty and rich ecological resources. The lake is believed to have been formed during the last Ice Age when a glacier melted and created a depression in the landscape. Over time, the Schwentine River meandered through this depression, forming a loop or oxbow in the river’s course. The oxbow is now a separate body of water from the river and is surrounded by lush forested areas and wetlands. Schwentine Oxbow Lake is known for its diverse flora and fauna, including several rare and endangered species of plants and animals. Some of the notable plants found in the area include water lilies, sedges, and reeds, while the lake is home to various species of fish, amphibians, and water birds such as herons, swans, and geese. Apart from its natural beauty, the lake also has historical significance as it was part of the historic salt trade route during the Middle Ages. The nearby town of Kiel was an important trading center, and the Schwentine River and its tributaries were used to transport salt from the Baltic Sea into the interior regions of Germany. Today, the Schwentine Oxbow Lake is a popular spot for leisure activities such as hiking, canoeing, and bird-watching. Visitors can explore the beautiful natural surroundings of the lake through various trails and observation decks that offer stunning views of the lake and its surroundings.

Also, it explained some of the questions children have around the event: why Zwarte Piet (Black Peter) is black (not his original skin colour, but because of sliding through the chimney) and how Sinterklaas acquires the presents (with a special kind of money). 20 years later, Bart Peeters stated it is thanks to Matthysen that in Belgium the Sinterklaas event has not been subject of a racism discussion as it has been in the Netherlands, because the series explains the figure of Zwarte Piet has nothing to do with slavery.\n\nIn 1990, together with HUMO chief-editor Guy Mortier, he presented the acts on the festival Torhout-Werchter (currently Rock Werchter).\n\nHis alter ego Clement Peerens became famous with his band CPeX (Clement Peerens Explosition – together with Ronny Mosuse and again Bart Peeters) and the girl band Hormonia.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Hugo Matthysen again gave concerts with the Clement Peerens Explosition.\n\nIn 2010, he wrote the humouristic TV program Anneliezen.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nLiving people\n1956 births\n20th-century Flemish male actors\nBelgian male singers\nBelgian pop singers\nBelgian rock singers\nDutch-language singers of Belgium\nBelgian male guitarists\nBelgian comedy musicians\nBelgian male comedians\nBelgian columnists\nBelgian radio presenters\nFlemish writers\nBelgian surrealist artists\nBelgian surrealist writers\nFlemish television writers\nBelgian television presenters\nFlemish male voice actors\nMale radio actors\nFlemish male television actors\nMale television writers\nPeople from Ekeren", "machine_text": "Hugo Matthysen is a Belgian author, musician, and screenwriter known for his contributions to the Flemish cultural scene. Born on February 30th, 1956 in Antwerp, he began his career as a writer in the 1980s, gaining popularity with his satirical columns in the Humo magazine. Matthysen's writing shows a fascination with both the absurd and the mundane. His work often deals with the idiosyncrasies of everyday life, such as the weirdness of certain expressions or the banality of office work. He is also known for his humorous takes on politics and society, criticizing the Belgian monarchy in his book \"De koningklijke familie\" and creating a fictional political party in his TV show \"Mag ik u kussen?\". Aside from writing, Matthysen is also active in the music industry. He was a founding member of the rock band \"De Clement Peerens Explosition\" and has released several solo albums, including \"Alle 40 Goed\" and \"Ik Ga Dood Aan Jou\". Matthysen's work has won him several accolades over the years. In 2006, he was awarded the Golden Owl prize for his book \"Hotel Rozenstok\". He has also won two Vlaamse Televisie Sterren for his work on TV shows, as well as a Radio 2 Zomerhit nod for \"Kvraagetaan\", one of his most popular songs. Despite his success, Matthysen remains humble about his contributions to the Belgian cultural scene. In an interview with Knack magazine, he once said: \"I'm not saving the world.

In 1974 he started to work for Sara Lee, where he ultimately became the president of the board of directors.\n\nOn 31 December 1993 he withdrew from Sara Lee. In the beginning of 1994 he was asked by former Philips top executive Jan Timmer to participate in the Board of Directors of Philips, to breathe new life to the brand Philips. Boonstra was responsible for the 'Let's make things better'- campaign.\n\nTwo years after his commencement of employment with Philips, Boonstra became the successor of Timmer as the president of the board of directors. He held this leading position until 2001. While Boonstra was in charge, the market-value of Philips increased fivefold mainly by focusing on short-term profits and selling off company units like BSO/Origin (now a part of Atos and record company PolyGram. During his leadership he moved the head office (the top 350 employees) of Philips from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, the capital of the country. Since most of the regular staff remained in Eindhoven, the birthplace of the company, this move was not popular among Philips employees. In 2000 Boonstra was chosen 'top executive of the year'. Boonstra divorced two times, and has two children (Cor Boonstra and Roelof Boonstra) of his first wife.\n\nIn 1998 Boonstra and his first wife barely survived a hijacking. At that time Boonstra already was having an affair with Sylvia Tóth. A few years later, Boonstra was accused of insider trading in which he allegedly earned several hundreds of thousands of euros by trading in Endemol shares (where Sylvia Tóth was a member of the board) just before that company was acquired by the Spanish Telefónica. Boonstra was ultimately acquitted in court as no hard evidence existed that his partner Tóth had shared the information on the impending deal with him. The Dutch press referred to the inside deal as the \"pillow talk deal\".\n\nA few months later Cor Boonstra was again charged for not reporting trading in Ahold shares where he himself was a member of the board. He was found guilty and charged a 135.000 euro fine.\n\nReferences \n Encyclopedia, Dutch Wikipedia, Article Cor Boonstra, User Falcongj, added 2 January 2004, last edit 4 April 2009\n\nExternal links\n Philips Global - access to worldwide local sites, research, consumer products, Healthcare, lighting etc.\n\nNotes\n\n1938 births\nLiving people\nDutch chief executives in the manufacturing industry\nDutch chief executives in the technology industry\nDutch chief executives in the food industry\nDutch businesspeople\nPhilips employees\nChairmen of Philips\nDutch corporate directors\nUnilever people\nPeople from Leeuwarden", "machine_text": "Cor Boonstra (born October 22, 1938) is a Dutch businessman and former CEO of Philips Electronics. He is known for leading the company through a period of significant change and restructuring, and for his controversial departure from the company. Boonstra began his career in 1963 as a sales trainee at IBM Netherlands. He held a number of positions at IBM over the next two decades, ultimately rising to the position of general manager for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In 1993, he left IBM to become CEO of Philips Electronics. Boonstra's tenure at Philips was marked by a focus on streamlining the company's operations and improving profitability. He implemented a series of cost-cutting measures, including reducing the company's workforce and selling off non-core businesses. He also oversaw the expansion of Philips into new markets, such as digital technology and healthcare. Despite these efforts, Boonstra's tenure was not without controversy. In 2000, he was accused of insider trading in shares of a Dutch supermarket chain. He was ultimately acquitted of these charges, but the incident tarnished his reputation and led to his departure from Philips later that year. After leaving Philips, Boonstra served on the boards of several companies, including Heineken and Deutsche Bank. He also became involved in philanthropy, founding the Cor and Pauline Boonstra Foundation to support medical research and education. Boonstra is remembered as a tough and driven leader who oversaw a period of significant change at one of the world's largest electronics companies. While his tenure at Philips ended on a sour note, his contributions to the company and to Dutch business more broadly are still widely recognized.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23548902}

Characters from both of the previous books reappear in Messenger and give the novels a stronger continuity.\n\nSet in an isolated community, known simply as Village, Messenger focuses upon a boy, Matty, who serves as message-bearer through the ominous and lethal Forest that surrounds the community.\n\nPlot\nMatty, who was introduced in Gathering Blue as \"Matt\", now lives with Seer, who was originally named Christopher and is a blind man rescued by the people of the Village years earlier. \n\nOutside the safe boundaries of Village is the Forest, an unwelcoming realm that most of the Villagers fear because of its powerful harm. Despite the lack of dangerous beasts, The Forest is animated. \n\nPeople who trade at a gathering, Trade Mart, change from being compassionate and generous to angry and impatient. The Villagers change temperament and decide to close their borders and stop permitting the displaced and the unwanted of other communities to enter. Seer, in the wake of the sudden change, decides to send Matty to travel through the Forest to retrieve his daughter, Kira, who lives in a town several days away. \n\nThe gift is a special ability that Matty possesses but hardly understands. It is a power of healing that causes wholeness from the inside out. Matty puts his hands to the ground and manages to restore the integrity of The Forest and people alike at the expense of his own life from the thickening forest. The Leader (Jonas) names Matty as \"the Healer.\"\n\nAt the end of the novel, Matty's soul drifts deep into the earth, which saves the villagers and Forest.

It is the third book in the series which began with The Giver and continued with Gathering Blue. Set in the same dystopian universe as the previous books, Messenger explores themes such as social justice and the consequences of one's actions. The story centers around Matty, a young boy who lives in Village, a community where everyone is equal and people with disabilities or different abilities are cast out. Matty is able to travel safely through the dangerous Forest to deliver messages from Village to other communities. However, as the novel progresses, the Forest becomes increasingly dangerous and Matty must grapple with difficult ethical decisions in order to save his friends. One of the key themes of Messenger is the importance of compassion and empathy. Matty is initially selfish and indifferent to others' suffering, but as he faces more challenges, he learns to put others' needs before his own. This growth is exemplified in his relationship with Kira, the protagonist of Gathering Blue, who makes a cameo appearance in the book. Matty's love for Kira motivates him to undertake a dangerous journey to save her life, despite the risks to his own. Like the previous books in the series, Messenger has been praised for its thought-provoking content and engaging characters. It has won several awards, including the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award and the William Allen White Children's Book Award. Many educators have also praised the book for its potential as a teaching tool for discussing complex themes such as social justice. Overall, Messenger is a powerful novel that invites readers to reflect on their own actions and the impact they have on others. Its vivid characters and challenging themes make it a memorable addition to the young adult literary canon.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1467684}

It is characterized by a satirical and irreverent style, often including drug use and other countercultural themes. This type of humor was often seen in comedy films, television shows, and stand-up comedy performances. It was embraced by audiences who were looking for an alternative to the traditional, conservative humor of the past. The 1970s marked a period of significant social and cultural change in the United States, characterized by the Vietnam War protests, the Civil Rights Movement, and the emergence of the counterculture. As a result, comedians and other entertainers began exploring new ways of connecting with audiences, often by drawing on these social and cultural currents. One of the most well-known examples of Dope Humor of the Seventies was the Cheech and Chong comedy duo. Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong became famous for their stoner comedy routines and films, including \"Up in Smoke\" and \"Nice Dreams.\" Other comedians who embraced this style of humor included Richard Pryor, who tackled issues of race and drug use in his stand-up routines; George Carlin, who used biting satire to critique various aspects of American life; and Saturday Night Live's Gilda Radner and John Belushi, who developed characters, such as Roseanne Roseannadanna and Samurai Futaba, that embodied this irreverent style. While Dope Humor of the Seventies was often criticized for its drug use and profanity, it was also celebrated for pushing the boundaries of humor and addressing important social issues.

In Korea, a Go variant called Sunjang baduk was played.\n\nJapan\nAt the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, four Go academies were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of Godokoro (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed Meijin (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade. Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of Jun-Meijin (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the iemoto system (家元). All heads of the house Inoue (井上) were named Inseki (因碩), heads of the house Yasui (安井 ) were named Senkaku (仙角) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house Hayashi (林) were named Monnyu (門入) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement.

It is considered to be equal to the Japanese title of Meijin. \nThe term Qi Sheng (棋圣) was first mentioned by Ge Hong (葛洪) in 《抱朴子》：“棋之无敌者，则谓之棋圣。” The literal meaning is the Invincible Qi player is called the Saint of Qi (Qi Sheng). \nNote that both Guoshou and Qisheng were not tournament winner titles; instead they were honorific titles used by Wei Qi players and historians respectively to refer to the best players who were invincible in highest graded tournaments. Guoshou was the normal term used to refer to the promo player while he was alive, whereas Qisheng was used more as posthumous fame. \nThe ranking of players began in West Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE) and formally recognized by the Governments during the North and South Dynasties Period (3rd to 6th century CE). There were 9 ranks called pin 品 in the system, the same as the ranking system for government officials. The lowest rank was 9 pin, then 8 pin, etc. up to 1 pin.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"2011 Los Angeles Angels season\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim' 2011 season was the franchise's 51st season and 46th in Anaheim. The Angels began the season following a disappointing 2010 campaign where they missed the postseason for the first time since 2006, after winning the American League West three times in a row from 2007 to 2009. During the 2011 season, the Angels celebrated the franchise's 50th anniversary and because it was the \"golden Anniversary\", a gold trim was added to the uniforms including the halo on both the cap and uniform (the halo from 1993 to 1996, 2002–2010 was silver and gold prior to that). The date of the franchise's actual 50th anniversary is December 6, 2010. The season saw the debut of Mike Trout, who made his major league debut on July 8, 2011. Although he batted  .220 during his brief time on the year, he would be back the following season as the regular fielder for the team.\n\n2010–11 offseason\nAfter an incredibly disappointing 2010 season, the Angels' priority in the offseason was to fix what went horribly wrong so the team can return to the postseason in 2011. Owner Arte Moreno has gone on record saying that money will not be an issue, and that he is willing to spend as much as possible to put a winning product on the field. Going into the offseason, the Angels had both Hideki Matsui and Scot Shields eligible for free agency with Kendrys Morales, Jered Weaver, Erick Aybar, Howie Kendrick, Kevin Frandsen, Alberto Callaspo, Reggie Willits, and Mike Napoli being arbitration eligible. As of December 3, 2010, the Angels have declined to offer Matsui arbitration, tendered contracts to Morales, Weaver, Aybar, Kendrick, Callaspo, Willits, and Napoli. The Angels also declined to tender a contract to Frandsen, who would become a free agent, and Shields, who would retire from baseball.\n\nThe Angels expressed interest in Rays outfielder Carl Crawford, Red Sox third baseman Adrián Beltré, Rays closer Rafael Soriano, Phillies outfielder Jayson Werth, and were considered a wildcard in the Cliff Lee sweepstakes. On December 2, 2010, the Angels signed former Mets reliever Hisanori Takahashi in their first move of the offseason. then signed Blue Jays reliever Scott Downs, and also acquired outfielder Vernon Wells from Toronto in exchange for outfielder Juan Rivera and catcher Mike Napoli.\n\nRegular season\nSee the game log below for detailed game-by-game regular season information.\n\nThe season for the Angels began Thursday, March 31 with a road game against Kansas City.  Their first home game was Friday, April 8 against Toronto.  Their longest homestand will be from June 27 – July 10 (13 home games), and their longest road trip will be June 13–26 (12 road games).  Their final game of the regular season will be on Wednesday, September 28 at home against Rangers.\n\nMarch/April\nAfter winning the first game of the season against Kansas City, the Angels stumbled dropping their next three games against that same Royals team. The Halos led at one point in each of those three losses and the suspect bullpen was a large reason why they dropped those three in a row. After the Kansas City series, manager Mike Scioscia shook up the bullpen by demoting Fernando Rodney from the closer's role and giving Jordan Walden that position. The Angels proceeded to sweep the Tampa Bay Rays in St. Petersburg and win and go 4–2 on their opening homestand against the Blue Jays and Indians. The Angels winning ways continued into their second road trip of the season sweeping the Chicago White Sox and taking 2 of 3 from division rival Texas and taking sole control of first in the American League West. However, the Angels hit a wall when they returned home to Angel Stadium being swept by arch-rival Boston in a four-game series and only scoring a total of five runs over that four game stretch. Texas, in the meantime took back the top spot in the AL West. After their abysmal showing against Boston, the Angels rebounded slightly by taking 2 of 3 from division rival Oakland finishing out the homestand 2–5. Going back to Tampa Bay, the Angels took the series 2–1 only losing the second game of the series on a wild pitch by relief pitcher Fernando Rodney in the 10th inning. The second game of the series also featured Joel Piñeiro's first start of the season where he only gave up one run over 7 innings pitched.\n\nMay\nThe Angels started out the month of May by finishing off a series with Tampa Bay that they won 2–1. After that series, the Angels flew to Boston to take on the team that swept them in Anaheim just a week prior. The Halos ended up dropping the first two games of that series, but ended up winning the third game of the series in a marathon 13 inning game that lasted 7 hours and 35 minutes thanks to a 2-hour and 35 minute rain delay. In the fourth game, the Angels pounded out 8 runs off of their former ace John Lackey and ended up winning the game 11–0 to earn the series split 2–2. Returning home to Anaheim where the Angels had a 6–7 mark, they were to face the red-hot Cleveland Indians in a three-game series. They won the first game in extra innings behind an excellent outing by rookie Tyler Chatwood and the bullpen, however the Angels then proceeded to drop the second game of the series. They did win the rubber game of the series on Mother's Day in a game that saw the lead change many times. The win against the Indians on May 8, marked manager Mike Scioscia's 1,000th career victory (all of which were with the Angels).\n\nSchedule and results\n\nRegular season\n\n|- align=\"center\"

Under the guidance of manager Mike Scioscia, the Angels finished the season with a record of 86-76, finishing in second place in the American League West division, 10 games behind the Texas Rangers. The Angels had a solid start to the season, winning their opening game against the Kansas City Royals. However, inconsistency was a problem throughout the year, with the team struggling to put together winning streaks. Their longest winning streak of the season was just five games. Offensively, the Angels were led by outfielder Torii Hunter, who hit .262 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs. First baseman Mark Trumbo had an impressive rookie season, hitting .254 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs. Albert Pujols, who signed with the Angels prior to the 2012 season, was not on the roster yet. On the pitching side, Jered Weaver was the standout performer. He finished the season with a record of 18-8, a 2.41 ERA, and 198 strikeouts. Dan Haren also had a solid season, going 16-10 with a 3.17 ERA and 192 strikeouts. Despite the Angels' disappointing finish, several players received recognition for their performances. Weaver finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting, while Trumbo finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year Award voting. Looking to improve for the following season, the Angels made several key moves in the offseason, including the aforementioned signing of Pujols.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Vernon Prichard\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Vernon Edwin \"Prich\" Prichard (January 25, 1892 – July 10, 1949) was an American football quarterback and United States Army officer. He played college football with Army and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1914. He became a career officer in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of major general. He was lifelong friends with West Point classmate Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower and, during World War II, he commanded the 14th Armored Division in the United States from 1942 to 1944 and the 1st Armored Division from 1944 to 1945 during the Italian Campaign.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Onawa, Iowa, Prichard was the son of attorney J.A. Prichard.  The younger Prichard began his education at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he also played football and established a reputation as a passer.  In November 1910, while he was a student at Morningside, Prichard received word that he had been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.  He enrolled at West Point on June 11, 1911.\n\nU.S. Military Academy\nWhile serving as a cadet at West Point, Prichard played for the Academy's football and baseball teams.  He gained his greatest fame in football as the quarterback for the Army Black Knights football team from 1912 to 1914.  Prichard's teammates on the Army football teams included two of the leading generals of World War II, Omar Bradley, who played at the end position, and Dwight Eisenhower, who played halfback until a knee injury sidelined him.  James Van Fleet, commander of U.S. forces in the Korean War, also played on the 1914 West Point football team with Prichard.  Although he weighed only 158 pounds, Prichard played every minute of every major game during his three years of varsity football at West Point.\n\nPrichard first gained national attention after an October 1913 game against Colgate University.  Colgate led 6–0 with ten seconds left to play, when Prichard sprinted 70 yards for a touchdown to lead Army to a 7–6 victory.\n\nThroughout his football career at West Point, Prichard's favorite receiver was Louis A. Merrilat from Chicago.  The passing team of \"Prichard to Merrilat\" was one of the first great passing combinations in college football.  The Prichard-Merrilat combination gained national fame after the 1913 Army–Navy Game, played in New York before a crowd of 40,000 at the Polo Grounds.  Army had not defeated Navy since 1905, and Navy was undefeated and favored to beat Army by odds of 6–1.  Although Navy had allowed only seven points in its other games in 1913, Prichard and Merrilat teamed up to lead Army to a 22–9 win, with Prichard throwing two touchdown passes to Merrilat. The crowd reportedly left the Polo Grounds chanting, \"Prichard-to-Merillat, Prichard-to-Merillat ...\"\nover and over again.\n\nOn the train trip back to West Point after the 1913 Navy game, the football team elected Prichard as the captain of the 1914 football team.  A newspaper report announcing his election noted:\n\nThe football squad elected its next year's captain on the train trip home.  They chose Cadet Vernon E. Prichard of the second class as their leader.  Cadet Prichard has played quarterback on the team for two seasons and got in every game except one on the army's schedule this season.  His brilliant forward passing, spectacular open field running and excellent generalship have made him one of the season's leading quarterbacks. ... His election was unanimous.  He is a color sergeant in the cadet battalion and popular with his teammates and fellow cadets.\n\nIn 1914, Prichard led Army to an undefeated 9–0 season.  In the final game of the season, Army defeated Navy, 20–0, as Prichard finished his college football career by throwing passes to Merrilat and Bob Neyland, who later became the football coach at the University of Tennessee.  At the end of the season, Prichard was selected as a first-team All-American quarterback.\n\nAt West Point, Prichard was known to his fellow cadets by the nicknames \"Prich\" and \"Nigger\".  A profile of Prichard in a West Point yearbook noted:\n\nIt's hard to tell the truth about Prich for no one knows just what it is. Some move him right up beside St. Peter and hand him a 'New Model Harp' with printed directions for playing, while others give him a dog's name and call him Nigger.  But wherever you rank him, it's a safe bet that he'll feel right at home.  He'll borrow his Satanic Majesty's opera cloak for the first night or slap the old Saint on the back and ask him for Bull and papers.\"\n\nMilitary career\n\nEarly years\nUpon graduating from the Academy in June 1915, Prichard received the rank of second lieutenant and was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. He served at Eagle Pass, Texas, from September 1915 to April 1916 and participated in the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico from April to August 1916. While serving in Mexico, Prichard was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Prichard returned to West Point for temporary duty during the fall of 1916 but returned to Mexico from December through February 1917.\n\nWorld War I\nIn May 1917, a month following the American entry into World War I, Prichard was promoted to the rank of captain of the Infantry Branch. He sailed for the Western Front via England on January 8, 1918. He entered Germany with the Army of Occupation via Belgium and Luxembourg and served in Germany and France through June 1919.\n\nWorld War II\nPrichard remained lifelong friends with his backfield partner, Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower. Eisenhower later recalled that he looked for \"natural leaders\" from the ranks of football. Eisenhower believed that football, more than any other sport, instilled the belief that victory comes from teamwork and dedication. He identified Prichard as one of the officers with football background who had \"measured up\" during the war.\n\nChoosing to remain in the army in the period between the wars, during World War II, Prichard served as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 27th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940–41. He served as chief of staff of the 4th Armored Division from 1941–42 and as Commanding General (CG) of the 14th Armored Division from November 1942 until July 1944. From July 1944 until September 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was the CG of the 1st \"Old Ironsides\" Armored Division during the Italian Campaign, including the Battle of the Gothic Line, Po Valley and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.\n\nPrichard and Eisenhower exchanged correspondence during the war.  Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower wrote a letter to Prichard in which he confided \"this is a long tough road we have to travel.\" In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that \"men that can do things are going to be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning,\" and \"fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered.\"\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, Prichard wrote to Eisenhower, reminding him of what their football coach had taught them: \"If things break badly or go against you -- stay with it all the harder.\" Eisenhower's biographer, Matthew Holland, later wrote that Eisenhower had learned important lessons on the football playing field at West Point, and concluded: \"World War II was won on the playing fields of West Point, and Ike would prove to be the quarterback of the winning team.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Prichard became the Chief of the Army Public Information Division. In February 1949, President Harry S. Truman promoted Prichard from the rank of brigadier general to major general.\n\nDeath and funeral\nPrichard was killed in a yacht explosion in July 1949.  He was part of a group that had boarded the yacht Halcyon for a picnic cruise on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.  The craft was within yards of the dock at the Corinthian Yacht Club when an explosion destroyed the vessel.  Prichard was thrown into the Potomac and killed instantly.  Navy Commodore Wilfred Painter was also killed in the blast.  Philadelphia soldier, diplomat and socialite Col. Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. dove into the Potomac in an effort to save Prichard and recovered his body.\n\nPrichard's funeral was held at the chapel of Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.  The Army's chief of chaplains officiated at the funeral, and the honorary pallbearers included Secretary of the Army, Gordon Gray, and classmates from the West Point Class of 1915, including Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nDecorations\nHere is the ribbon bar of Major General Prichard:\n\nSee also\n1914 College Football All-America Team\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGenerals of World War II\n\n|-\n\n1892 births\n1949 deaths\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nArmy Black Knights baseball players\nArmy Black Knights football players\nMorningside Mustangs football players\nUnited States Army generals\nUnited States Army Command and General Staff College alumni\nRecipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)\nRecipients of the Legion of Merit\nOfficiers of the Légion d'honneur\nRecipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France)\nRecipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross\nBurials at Arlington National Cemetery\nPeople from Monona County, Iowa\nGraduates of the United States Military Academy Class of 1915\nUnited States Army personnel of World War I\nUnited States Army generals of World War II\nMilitary personnel from Iowa", "machine_text": "Vernon Prichard was a prominent American architect who is best known for his work in the early to mid-twentieth century. He was born in 1905 in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in a family of artists and designers. His father, a successful businessman, was an amateur painter, and his mother taught art and design at a local community college. Prichard was initially drawn to art and design and studied at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania's School of Architecture. He graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture from Penn in 1930 and worked for several years in Philadelphia before moving to New York City in 1934. In New York, he worked for several prominent firms, including James Gamble Rogers and Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon. In 1940, Prichard opened his own firm in New York City, initially partnering with the architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. Together, they designed a number of notable buildings, including the Marine Midland Bank building in New York City and the SUNY Albany Campus Center. Throughout his career, Prichard was known for his innovative use of materials and for his elegant, functional designs. He was particularly interested in the integration of architecture with the natural environment, and many of his buildings feature dramatic views, natural light, and landscaping. He also believed in the importance of incorporating art and design into architecture, and he often collaborated closely with artists to create unique installations and features within his buildings. Prichard received numerous awards and accolades for his work over the course of his career, including the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects in 1972. He died in 1997 at the age of 91, leaving behind a legacy of elegant, innovative, and influential architecture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26374342}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eucalyptus olsenii\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eucalyptus olsenii, commonly known as the Woila gum, is a species of small tree that is endemic to a restricted area on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales. It has smooth bark with rough bark on the lower trunk, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped or urn-shaped fruit.\n\nDescription\nEucalyptus olsenii is a tree that typically grows to a height of  high and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (olsenii) honours Ian Sinclair Olsen, who recognised the species as distinct on a bushwalking expedition lead by Henry Fairlie-Cuninghame who collected the type material.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nWoila gum is restricted to mountains north east of Cooma and south of Braidwood, where it grows in woodland in poor soil on steep slopes. It also grows well as an ornamental tree.\n\nReferences\n\nolsenii\nMyrtales of Australia\nTrees of Australia\nFlora of New South Wales\nPlants described in 1980\nTaxa named by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson", "machine_text": "Eucalyptus olsenii is a species of flowering tree that belongs to the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the south-west part of Western Australia, where it is found in a small area between Esperance and Coomalbidgup. The species was first discovered by John Stanley Beard in 1974, and was subsequently named in honor of the Western Australian botanist, Hank Olsen. Eucalyptus olsenii is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height and has a trunk that ranges from 30-50 cm in diameter. The bark is smooth, grey, and has patches of white. The leaves are lance-shaped and are around 6-12 cm long and 1-2 cm wide. They are dark green and have a leathery texture. The flowers are white or cream-colored and are arranged in groups of three to seven. Eucalyptus olsenii is an important species in its native range, where it plays a crucial role in providing habitat for wildlife and in stabilizing soil. It is commonly found growing in areas that are prone to erosion, and its deep roots help to stabilize the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The species is also used for timber and firewood. The conservation status of Eucalyptus olsenii is classified as 'threatened' under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. This is due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by agriculture and urbanization, as well as invasive species. Efforts are being made to protect the species and its habitat, including the establishment of conservation reserves and the implementation of weed control programs. In conclusion, Eucalyptus olsenii is an important species of tree that is found only in a small area of Western Australia. It provides habitat for wildlife, helps to stabilize soil, and is used for timber and firewood. However, the species is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and conservation efforts are necessary to ensure its survival.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10658927}

She currently resides in Uzbekistan and is married to filmmaker Oleg Karpov. In 2010 she was convicted of \"slander of the Uzbek nation\" after making a documentary. Since 2010, she can not participate in any official exhibitions in Uzbekistan.\n\nWork\nAs a photographer she has participated in exhibitions addressing urban and rural issues and has collaborated on film and book projects including the presentation of the short film The Burden of Virginity. As an Associated Press photographer, her images have been published in the photography sections of the online editions of The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and The Globe and Mail. As a photojournalist and artist she has worked onprojects dedicated to exploring issues of human rights. In the course of her work she has documented the traditions, disparate cultures and everyday events in the modern borders of Uzbekistan.\n\nUmida Akhmedova is one of the most prominent representatives of the Uzbek photography.\n\nArrest and criminal charges\nOn November 17, 2009 she was summoned by Nodir Akhmadzhan, investigator of the Tashkent city police department and accused of defamation and of \"insult and slander of the Uzbek nation.\" These charges against her and others are due in part to participation on a project sponsored by the Swiss Embassy Gender Program. One of the works, Women and men: from dawn till dusk documents aspects of life in rural Uzbekistan. On December 16, 2009, criminal charges were filed against her due to her involvement in the aforementioned project as well as other gender and human rights media projects including The Burden of Virginity, about difficulties faced by women in Uzbekistan. The criminal charges carry a possible sentence of prison for up to six months, or 2–3 years of forced labor and she is currently banned from leaving the country.\n\nIn January 2010 she was accused of slander, allegedly \"insulting the Uzbek people\" after she produced her book portraying rural Uzbekistan and Uzbek traditions. She was charged on January 13, after an expert panel of 'specialists in the fields of religious affairs, spirituality, and psychology' found that her images portrayed Uzbekistan in a negative light to Western audiences: \"a foreigner who has never been to Uzbekistan, but who is familiar with this album, would reach the conclusion that [Uzbekistan] is a country where people live in the Middle Ages\"\n\nIn February 2010 she was found guilty of slandering and insulting the Uzbek people, but could walk away free. Though the charges carried a prison sentence of up to three years imprisonment, the judge waived a penalty saying that the convict was granted an amnesty in honor of the 18th anniversary of Uzbek independence. She said she intended to appeal the conviction.\n\n\"Portsmouth University Pugwash\" columnist Mark Norman commented that, \"Umida Akhmedova is an Uzbek photographer who, in 2007, produced an album of images of the everyday lives of the people of Uzbekistan. The album, titled “Men and Women: Dawn to Dusk”, contains more than 100 images of Uzbek traditions and customs. The images, which are of simple and everyday scenes, have been severely lambasted by the Uzbek authorities, who have claimed the images portray the people of Uzbekistan as “backward”. The government authorities have since charged Akhmedova with “slander” and “insult“ against her own nation.

Akhmedova's photography showcases the deeply rooted traditions of Uzbekistan, often focusing on the daily lives of the people who inhabit the region. Her work primarily revolves around the themes of identity, gender, and human rights, aiming to create a bridge between the East and West. Akhmedova's keen observation and attention to detail is reflected in her work, which has been exhibited worldwide, including in the United States, France, Germany, and Japan. In 2007, Akhmedova released her first documentary film, entitled \"The Burden of Virginity,\" which received critical acclaim for its honest portrayal of the lives of young girls in Uzbekistan. The film brought to the forefront the issue of virginity being a social expectation for women, and created a dialogue on the importance of sexual education. Akhmedova's other notable works include the photo series \"Women and Men\" and \"Men in Military,\" both of which examine gender stereotypes and the roles assigned to men and women in Uzbek society. Her work has been awarded numerous times, including the World Press Photo Award in 2010 for her series \"Marrying a Dead Man,\" which showcased the lives of women in the rural regions of Uzbekistan.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cat Person\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Cat Person\" is a short story by Kristen Roupenian that was first published in December 2017 in The New Yorker before going viral online. The BBC described the short story as \"being shared widely online as social media users discuss how much it relates to modern day dating\".\n\nThe novel is currently being adapted to a film of the same name directed by Susanna Fogel.\n\nSynopsis\nThe story follows the brief relationship of Margot, a twenty-year-old sophomore college student, and Robert, an older man who is a regular at the movie theater where Margot works. After an exchange at the concession stand, he asks for her number, and they carry on extensive conversations through texts. Margot finds Robert witty and funny through text, and their conversations grow frequent, but he is more awkward and inscrutable when she tries to see him in person.\n\nWhen Margot returns from visiting home for winter break, she and Robert go on a real date: they see a movie, go to a bar (during which Robert learns her age), and then return to Robert's home. Despite being disappointed and uncomfortable during the date, Margot consents to sex with Robert rather than navigate turning him down. After the encounter, which largely disgusts her, Margot learns that Robert is thirty-four years old and reflects that their conversations have been impersonal.\n\nMargot resolves to tell Robert she isn't interested in continuing to see him, but ignores his messages while she is unsure of how to do it politely but firmly. She eventually does so abruptly through text at the urging of her roommate. A month later, she sees Robert while out at a bar with her friends; she is unsettled by the idea that he is looking for her and avoids him. That night, he texts her repeatedly, his messages at first complimentary and insecure but becoming more needy and belligerent as Margot does not reply, ending with calling her a \"Whore\".\n\nReception\nThe Washington Post described \"Cat Person\" as unique among the content in The New Yorker because it resonated with a younger audience, commenting: \"for one of the first times, something in the magazine seemed to capture the experience not of print-oriented, older intellectuals, but of Millennials.\" The story was the year's most downloaded fiction published in The New Yorker, and one of the most-read pieces overall of 2017. The Atlantic notes that \"The depiction of uncomfortable romance in 'Cat Person' seems to resonate with countless women\", and describes it as a \"literary adjunct to the latest #MeToo moment\". Personal reactions have been largely, but not entirely, along gender lines (drawing comparisons to Jane Austen), and for many readers, it captures what it is like to be a woman in her twenties in 2017, including \"the desperate need to be considered polite and nice at all costs\".\n\nFollowing the story's success, Roupenian secured a seven-figure deal with Scout Press for her debut book, and was the subject of a bidding war in the American market, with offers exceeding $1 million.\nShe received a $1.2 million advance for her 2019 book You Know You Want This, an anthology series which includes \"Cat Person\".\n\nControversy\nIn July 2021, Alexis Nowicki published an essay in Slate magazine alleging that Roupenian had appropriated details from Nowicki's life and that of her lover, and used them for \"Cat Person\", with Margot representing Nowicki and Robert representing Nowicki's former partner, only identified in the essay by the pseudonym \"Charles\".\n\nSocial media users reacted strongly to Nowicki's allegations. In the words of Elisabeth de Mariaffi, in Maclean's, \"Twitter went wild, with readers struggling to understand how a writer could justify using such real-life details, and writers rallying to defend themselves.\" The Guardian writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett described the potential for readers to feel that \"using someone else's story in this way was unethical.\"\n\nIn a 2021 email reply to Nowicki, Roupenian said she had an \"encounter\" with Charles and that she later found out about Nowicki through social media. Roupenian acknowledged that information she learned from Nowicki's social media served as a \"jumping-off point\" for \"a story that was primarily a work of the imagination, but which also drew on my own personal experiences, both past and present.\" She apologized for not changing particulars such as Nowicki's hometown, stating \"I can absolutely see why the inclusion of those details in the story would cause you significant pain and confusion.\"\n\nNowicki's essay points out salient differences between \"Cat Person\" and her relationship. Elisabeth de Mariaffi notes that \"the entire weight of Cat Person, what made it resonate, was exactly the part that Nowicki says bears no resemblance to the truth.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Cat Person\" at The New Yorker\n What It Felt Like When \"Cat Person\" Went Viral\n \"Cat Person\" and Me by Alexis Nowicki\n\n2017 short stories\nWorks originally published in The New Yorker\n2017 in women's history\nAmerican short stories", "machine_text": "Cat Person is a term often used to describe someone who loves and is passionate about cats.

Studies have found that cat owners have lower blood pressure, lower stress levels, and a decreased risk of heart disease. Not to mention, the affectionate nature of cats can provide a sense of comfort and companionship to their owners. The term \"cat person\" can be traced back to the early 1800s when the first domesticated cats arrived in the United States. The popularity of cats continued to grow throughout the 20th century, with cats being ranked as one of the most popular pets in the world. In recent years, Cat People have gained a strong online presence, with social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter highlighting the joys of being a Cat Person. There are now countless pages and accounts dedicated to celebrating feline companions and sharing photos and videos of cats in all their glory.

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

It was released in 2015 on the Misery Guts Music label and includes 13 tracks. Io is one of the four largest moons of Jupiter, and is known for its volcanic activity, which inspired the dark and theatrical themes of the album. The album features the distinctive vocals of frontman Martyn Jacques, who sings in a falsetto voice that has been likened to that of a demonic choirboy. The music is equally unique, with a blend of cabaret, punk, and vaudeville styles, creating a haunting and unsettling atmosphere. The opening track, \"His Teeth Got Lost In The Mattress,\" sets the tone for the album with its references to death and decay. From there, the songs explore themes such as madness, murder, and the macabre with tracks such as \"Twisted Circus,\" \"Scorched Earth,\" and \"The Flame.\" Despite the dark subject matter, Coffins on Io has received critical acclaim for its creativity and originality. The album has been praised for its use of various instruments, including a theremin, accordion, keyboard, and saw. It has also been noted for its use of sound effects, such as creaking doors, squeaky wheelchairs, and thunderclaps. While it may not be for everyone, Coffins on Io is a mesmerizing and haunting experience for those who appreciate experimental music that pushes the boundaries of what is normally expected. The Tiger Lillies have once again proven why they are one of the most unique and interesting bands out there.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 43660582}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hohenfels-Essingen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hohenfels-Essingen is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nGeography \n\nThe municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588 m), the Alter Voß (588 m, with “Liberation Beech”) and the Mühlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).\n\nHistory \nAs witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.\n\nRomans and Franks \nIn the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier.\n\nIn the district Im Keller (“In the Cellar”) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.\n\nThe great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the “army kings’” (Heerkönige) hands. The people who had lived here until now – Romanized Celts and Romans – either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.\n\n15th to 17th centuries \nEven before the Thirty Years' War, the Mühlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain’s south slope.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the Mühlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.\n\n18th and 19th centuries \nAs a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one.\n\nIn November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat  in Düsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War.\n\nIn 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit – the Feuerberg in Hohenfels – was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.\n\n20th century to present \n\nAfter the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland.\n\nIn the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the Mühlenberg. In the area around Hohenfels, a firm from Mayen was making runner stones and shipping them worldwide. In 1928 above the cadastral area of “Wahlend”, a gravelworks was built, remaining in operation until 1974.

It acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and with lower potency as an inhibitor of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM). These enzymes are both involved in detecting DNA damage as part of cell cycle checkpoints during cell division. By inhibiting their activity, berzosertib interferes with the ability of rapidly dividing cells to detect damage to DNA, and this makes it useful as a potential treatment for some forms of cancer by causing accumulation of DNA damage in the cancer cells and thus reducing their viability. It has progressed furthest in trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer, though also shows activity against numerous other cancer types.\n\nPhase 1 trial results show promising results in the first clinical trial of the drug class.The new study, designed to test the drug's safety, found that half of patients given the new drug either alone or with platinum chemotherapy saw their cancer stop growing, and two patients saw their tumors shrink or disappear completely.\n\nIn a UCLA-led study, berzosertib showed promise in treating COVID-19.\n\nReferences \n\nEnzyme inhibitors", "machine_text": "Berzosertib is a small-molecule inhibitor that works by inhibiting the protein ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase, which is responsible for regulating cellular responses to DNA damage. This drug has shown promise in clinical trials as a potential treatment for a wide range of cancers. Berzosertib was developed by the pharmaceutical company Mereo BioPharma and was originally known as MEDI3039. In 2018, it was granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In clinical trials, Berzosertib has demonstrated activity against both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. This drug has also been observed to sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that it may be effective in combination therapy. One notable aspect of Berzosertib is its ability to selectively target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells relatively unscathed. This is due in part to the fact that cancer cells are more reliant on the ATR pathway than healthy cells, making them more susceptible to inhibition of ATR kinase activity. Currently, Berzosertib is undergoing further clinical development in combination with other cancer treatments such as PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While it is still early days in terms of assessment of its full effectiveness, this promising drug has the potential to significantly improve the treatment of various cancers.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 64365868}

The new program in Rede Globo gradually shaped itself and soon after, a new album began to be developed as well.\n\nXuxa's audience had been growing. Many of the children who accompanied her in the days of the Xou da Xuxa were already entering their adolescence and thus the need arose to produce a disc that could please all the age groups.

The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year-round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day.\n\nFeatures\nThe main feature of the park is the ,  freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world’s largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to  a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from  and up to  deep.  The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving.\n\nHistory\nThe Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system.\n\nThe Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.\n\nIn early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery.

He was the second child and eldest son of eight children born to Hugh Seymour, 6th Marquess of Hertford (1843–1912) and the Hon. Mary Hood.  His siblings were Lady Margaret Alice Seymour (1869–1901) whose married name became a Ismay, Lady Emily Mary Seymour (1873–1948), Lady Victoria Frederica Wilhelmina Georgina Seymour (1874–1960), Lady Jane Edith Seymour (b. 1877), Lord Henry Charles Seymour (1878–1939), who married Lady Helen Grosvenor, a daughter of the 1st Duke of Westminster, Lord Edward Beauchamp Seymour (1879–1917), and Lord George Frederick Seymour (1881–1940).\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford, and Lady Emily Murray, daughter of David Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield.  His maternal grandparents were Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport, a British Army officer, and Lady Mary Penelope, the daughter of Arthur Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire.\n\nCareer\nIn 1895, he was sent to Australia by his family \"for the good of his health and the country\", due to his blatant behaviour. He settled in Mackay, growing sugar cane and bananas, but quickly created great animosity, due to being a dishonest employer: he was sued by a labourer (who won the case) for underpayment, and boasted tricking kanakas who purchased his chickens into thinking gold sovereigns were less valuable than silver half crowns.\n\nHe was noted for all-male house parties at his isolated residence 'The Rocks' near Mackay, and achieved notoriety for \"skirt dancing\" in a sequinned outfit with butterfly wings, as one newspaper phrased it: \"gyrating in the fluffy serpentine dance before a Kanaka audience... His legs being tough and skinny his audience show little inclination to pot him as long pig.\"  When he returned to England in 1897, a Mackay newspaper noted the citizens were \"more interested in his departure\" than his arrival.\n\nFrom 1889 to 1894, he served in the Black Watch and was a Lieutenant in the Warwickshire Imperial Yeomanry.  He held the office of Deputy Lieutenant for Warwickshire and Justice of the Peace for Warwickshire.\n\nHe appeared on stage in the United States in one of Charles Frohman's companies under the name of Eric Hope.\n\nHe filed for bankruptcy in 1909 and 1910, shortly before inheriting his father's titles and estate, Ragley Hall.\n\nPeerage\nIn 1884, he became the Earl of Yarmouth and in 1901, he became the 7th Marquess of Hertford.\n\nAfter his father's death on 23 March 1912, he succeeded as the 7th Earl of Hertford, the 7th Earl of Yarmouth, the 8th Baron Conway of Ragley, the 7th Viscount Beauchamp, the 7th Marquess of Hertford, and the 8th Baron Conway and Killultagh.\n\nPersonal life\nOn 27 April 1903, he married heiress Alice Cornelia Thaw (1880–1955).  She was the daughter of William Thaw Sr.  At the wedding he extorted her parents to increase the dowry under the threat he would not go through the marriage. The marriage was annulled in 1908 due to non-consummation.  As part of the divorce, all financial interests were returned to Thaw, and she resumed using her maiden name.\n\nIn May 1913, he became engaged to Mrs. Moss-Cockle, who was much older than him and received $3,250,000 by her former husband. By July of the same year, the engagement was called off, with The New York Times writing: \"It is rumored that lately the course of true love has not been running as smoothly as it ought to in the case of the Marquis of Hartford and Mrs. Moss Cockie, whose engagement was recently announced.\"\n\nLord Hertford died at his home in Torquay, Devonshire in 1940, aged 68 and childless.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Travel Companion Exchange\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Travel Companion Exchange (TCE) was a travel companion matching service established by Jens Jurgen in 1982. As the first general interest travel companion matching service in existence, it became the forerunner of many similar services and helped pioneer and legitimize the field of singles matching services in general. It was the largest  and most successful of its type at the time.\n\nHistory \nWhile traveling alone through Europe Jurgen developed the idea for a companion matching service for travelers. He already was operating a similar program for members who shared a common interest in the arts, and he had written several short books on travel subjects. Using the mailing list of those who had contacted him with inquiries about the books, he sent a questionnaire to gauge their interest in finding a travel companion. Met with an overwhelming positive response, he commenced on the larger service.\n\nInitially, his goal was to provide a service that would help travelers save money by sharing expenses, particularly to avoid the single supplement levied by cruise ship operators. He did not at first think that the service would serve as a matchmaker. However, he found that more than 70 percent of his clients either requested companions of the opposite sex or were willing to accept them; fewer than 15 percent wanted private rooms.\n\nHe developed a profile questionnaire that identified key personal habits and preferences that would impact on compatibility while traveling. After completing the questionnaire and mailing it to the TCE office, members were mailed a monthly summary of the profiles of all members with current travel plans or desires. They could then request the full profiles and contact information for those they were interested in.\n\nThe novelty and utility of the service soon resulted in write-ups in major publications like the Los Angeles Times  and Prevention magazine, which generated a flood of inquiries. As a result, the business grew quickly, and within a year it had 2,500 active members in 48 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Japan. By 1997 it had served over 70,000 members. No figures are available for the total number of members it had in the full 20 years it was in operation.\n\nThe monthly mailings were accompanied by a newsletter in which Jurgen shared tips drawn from his wealth of experience in the travel sector, and from the contributions of members and other travel professionals. This newsletter was rated by Newsday as \"one of the three best general travel newsletters.\"\n\nThe profile was so successful in indicating potentially compatible partners that the service suffered an unusually high turn-over due to members finding a permanent partner and dropping their memberships.\n\nJurgen operated the business out of his home in Amityville, NY, at first alone, then with staff made necessary by the increased workload. Competing services soon sprang up, and they began to use the Internet, reaching a larger audience at a lower cost. Jurgen, however, resisted transferring TCE to the Web due to his concern over the privacy and safety of his members, citing the difficulty of verifying the identity of online applicants. He did, however, put up home pages which directed visitors to the mailing address and phone numbers of the Amityville office.\n\nJurgen closed the business in 2003 for personal reasons.\n\nFounder \nOriginally from Germany, Jurgen was a mechanical engineer who worked for Long Island Light Co. While there, he started the employees' travel program, chartering flights to Europe, and began researching and writing on travel subjects. In 1976, after a divorce, he quit his job and toured Europe in an RV for three years.\n\nJurgen wrote and self-published several books during his career, including:\nGuide to Air Charter Groups and Air Travel Bargains (1967)\nEuropean Car Ferry Services (1971) and\nAir Travel & Charter Flight Handbook (1973)\nThe latter book led to his being called as an expert witness on air travel matters before a US Senate Committee which ultimately led to the airline deregulation hearings.\n\nThese books also brought such a quantity of inquiries by mail that he organized his own charter travel club and operated it until 1973.\n\nHe continued to write and publish other travel titles:\nCharter Flight Directory, subtitled \"How To Fly for Less\" (1976,1977 and 1978 editions) and\n1001 sources for Free Travel Information  – Valuable Freebies You Should Know About (1978)\nAccumulated tips from the TCE newsletter were compiled into a 24-page booklet called Foiling Pickpockets and Other Travel-related Scams (1997 and 2000 editions) which became recognized as the best consumer guide available  and Jurgen was frequently quoted in articles on the subject.\nThe titles were all well received by the public, and in total, he sold approximately 120,000 copies of the books.\n\nIn 1997, he married Eul Lee, whom he had met through TCE. She became his partner in the business as well – in fact, the demands of the work were such that they could only drive to Philadelphia for a few days for their honeymoon.\n\nRevival \nAfter his retirement, Jurgen retained ownership of the domain names he had used for TCE as well as several other travel related domains. In 2011 he sold the www.travelcompanionexchange.com domain to a former member of TCE, who revived it as an Internet-only travel companion matching service.\n\nReferences\n\n Hulse, Jerry (Nov. 13, 1983). \"Club for Lonely Single Travelers Produces Joy in Amityville Today\" Los Angeles Times\n Ketcham, Diane (March 23, 1997) \"Romance in the Air\" The New York Times\n\nAmerican travel websites\nAmerican social networking websites", "machine_text": "Travel Companion Exchange is a digital platform that allows travelers to find a travel companion who shares similar travel interests, preferences, and budget for their trip.

The film stars Rasika Dugal, Vikas Kumar and Talha Arshad Reshi in major roles, and is an adaptation of the play Phone No. 786 by Mohd. Amin Bhat. The story revolves about a seven-year-old Hamid who learns that 786 is God's number and decides to try and reach out to God, by dialing this number. He wants to talk to his father, who his classmate tells him has gone to Allah. One fine day the phone call is answered, and two lives shattered in the strife of Kashmir find a way to be complete again. The film is produced by Yoodlee Films, a venture of Saregama. The official trailer was released on 10 October 2018. Global premiere of Hamid was held at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival. The film went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Urdu at the 66th National Film Awards hosted in August 2019.\n\nPlot \n\nHamid is a young boy of seven, in search of his father who went missing a year ago. He somehow discovers that 786 is Allah's number, makes some combination and finally dials a phone number which is answered. Thus begins a series of conversations with the person on the other line who happens to be a CRPF soldier finding solace in Hamid's innocent talk. Hamid tells him about his father, his teachings and how his absence has changed their lives. Meanwhile, Hamid's mother is not able to make peace with the fact that her husband has disappeared. She is always lost in her grief and is dejected. \nHamid tries to learn his father's boat-making craft among various other means to please Allah, in belief that his father might return some day. Finally on one of the days Hamid realizes that his father is dead and would never return. His mother comes to terms with his death on the very same day. In the epilogue it is shown that Hamid finally gets his much desired red paint for the newly deigned boat (probably sent by the CRPF jawan), paints it and sails on it with his mother.\n\nThe film denotes how eventually people learn to deal with tragedies and move on no matter what, and serves as a powerful depiction of human resilience. What is striking is also the fact that despite being naive the boy knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong due to his father's teachings, again stressing the fact that we are a result of our upbringing.\n\nCast\nTalha Arshad Reshi as Hamid\nVikas Kumar as Abhay \nRasika Dugal as Ishrat\nSumit Kaul as Rehmat\nMir Sarwar as Abbass\nBashir Lone as Rasool Chacha\nVeer Rajwant Singh as Rajinder\nAshraf Nagoo as Basheer\nQazi Faiz as Beggar\nUmar Adil as Police Officer\nGulam Hussain Barji as Shopkeeper\nSajid as Police Constable\nShafia as Noor\n\nMarketing and release\nThe theatrical release poster of the film was released on 11 February 2019 giving the release date as 1 March 2019.

The film revolves around an eight-year-old boy named Hamid who lives in the conflict-ridden region of Kashmir. His father has disappeared, and his mother is struggling to make ends meet.

This came at a time when the government were negotiating peace terms to end the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession, which were unlikely to pass the Lords where opposition Whigs and some Tories had joined together to block them under the slogan \"No Peace Without Spain\".\n\nCreation\nTwo of the men, Lord Bruce and Lord Compton, were heirs to existing earldoms and were advanced to the house in their own right using their father's baronies. Others included Harley's son-in-law George Hay as well as George Granville, Thomas Mansel, Thomas Trevor, Thomas Foley all of whom were close political allies of the First Minister. Most controversial was that of Samuel Masham, the husband of Queen Anne's favourite Abigail Hill, a cousin and ally of Harley. While Bruce's letters patent were dated 31 December 1711, the other creations all took place on the subsequent day 1 January 1712. When Parliament resumed on 2 January they took their seats. Because their numbers resembled that of a jury, the Whig Lord Wharton mockingly asked if they were going to speak individually or elect a foreman to do so.\n\nAftermath\nDespite the controversy Harley was able to subsequently pass the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. However, the narrow Tory majority in the Lords disappeared in 1714 following the Hanoverian Succession when the Tory government was replaced by George I. Harley's alleged abuse of royal power and the violation of the constitution were part of the articles of impeachment against him, when he was prosecuted by Parliament in 1715. \n\nIn 1719 partly in a response to Harley's earlier creations, the Whig government of James Stanhope proposed a Peerage Bill which would have largely limited further expansion of the House of Lords. However, this was defeated and the size of the Lords continued to grow during the eighteenth century.\n\nFull list of the new peers\n Allen Bathurst, created Baron Bathurst\n Charles Bruce, Viscount Bruce of Ampthill, created Baron Bruce by acceleration\n James Compton, Lord Compton, created Baron Compton by acceleration\n Thomas Foley, created Baron Foley\n George Granville, created Baron Landsdowne\n George Hay, Viscount Dupplin, created Baron Hay\n Sir Thomas Mansel, 5th Baronet, created Baron Mansel\n Samuel Masham, created Baron Masham\n Henry Paget, created Baron Burton\n Thomas Trevor, created Baron Trevor\n Sir Thomas Willoughby, 2nd Baronet, created Baron Middleton\n Thomas Windsor, 1st Viscount Windsor, created Baron Mountjoy (Viscount Windsor was a title in the Peerage of Ireland and therefore did not entitled Lord Windsor to a seat in the British House of Lords.)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Colley, Linda.

Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate.

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1940 and went on to pursue graduate studies in Linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London. Joel became interested in African languages and cultures during his time at SOAS, and he went on to make several extended trips to Africa to research various languages, including Kikuyu, Luganda, and Gikuyu. He became an expert in African Linguistics, Anthropology, and African studies, publishing numerous articles, books, and monographs on African languages and cultures.

During the American Revolution, the lighthouse was seized by British forces and used as a lookout point. In the 19th century, it was used to guide merchant ships carrying goods to and from New York City. During World War II, the lighthouse was used by the Coast Guard to monitor enemy ships and submarines. In 1939, the New London Harbor Light was automated, and its keepers were no longer needed.

The reason for establishing the Yeshiva is that the Israeli nation needs a different Yeshiva that would underline the values of social leadership, military leadership together with giving and caring for the city of Modi'in and the state of israel.\nIn 2011 the Yeshiva has opened a Jewish library in memory of Avner Goldman z\"l, an Israeli religious air force pilot who lived in Modi'in. Avner was killed during a training flight in Romania.  His family donated the library.\n\nIn the end of 2013, the Yeshiva opened a branch in the city Ofakim, israel.\n\nThe military service \nThe Yeshiva has two main programs.  All programs start with a year and a half of studying in the yeshiva.\n the regular service\nthis program contains a 10-month service in IDF, 10 months of learning,\nanother year of military service and ending with two years of learning.\n the commanders service\nthis program contains an 11-month service in IDF, 8 months of learning,\na bit more than a year of military service and ending with to full years of learning.\nMost students that become commanders continue to be officers.  They come back only in the last year and their second army period is two years. On 14.02.13, Orthodox Israeli website reported \"Srugim\" that more than 50% of soldiers that are part of the program led by the Yeshiva, are combat IDF commanders.\n Military paramedics program\nIn 2013, the Yeshiva, MDA and IDF, have conceived a program based on the military service program in the Yeshiva, allowing orthodox youth MDA volunteers to join the IDF through the Yeshiva and be trained as Military paramedics. The reason for this is the lack of IDF paramedics.\n\nIn total: both programs are six-year programs.\n\nThe religious advantage \nThe learning time is extended and allows to grow religious scholars(Hebrew: תלמידי חכמים)\n\nThe military advantage \nThe Military service is extended by half a year more than the usual Hesder program.\nstudents would not be asked to leave the program if they wish to become officers, as done in some Yeshivot.\n\nShahak Lebnei Hamitzva and community relations \n\nThe Yeshiva's goal is to \"educate its students to follow in the path of Harav Kook זצ\"ל , to love the Torah, with a diligent devotion to deep Torah learning, Jewish Leadership, and love of the land and the nation.\"\n\nThe Yeshiva has a very tight relationship with the community of Modi'in, that is expressed by a variety of  activities that are held by both Yeshiva and community.\n\nOne of the projects organized   by the Yeshiva is called \"Shahak Lebnei Hamitzva\" in memory of Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a partner in establishing the Yeshiva, addressed to young boys, at age 13 from the secular sector in Modi'in.  The project, (that had been established while Lipkin-Shahak was alive, and was then simply called \"Bar Mitzvah Project\")  includes increased preparation classes taught, along with group lessons on Jewish identity, Jewish values, Jewish history, and practical volunteer work. At the end, the students, along with their parents, tutors and instructors, go on a guided tour of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.  At the end of the tour there is a group Aliyah Latorah (a Jewish custom) (in addition to those in private) and a festival lunch in honor of the mitzvah.

Due to its licentious nature the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers in the United States during the 19th century.  Federal court decisions from the mid- to late- 20th century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws.\n\nText\nFranklin begins by advising a young man that a cure for sexual urges is unknown, and the proper solution is to take a wife.  Then, expressing doubts that the intended reader will actually marry, Franklin names several advantages of marriage.  As supplementary advice in case the recipient rejects all previous arguments, Franklin lists eight reasons why an older mistress is preferable to a young one.  Advantages include better conversation, less risk of unwanted pregnancy, and \"greater prudence in conducting an intrigue.\"\n\nAccording to John Richard Stevens, the unnamed correspondent is a friend of Franklin's named Cadwallader Colden, and it remains unknown whether Franklin was serious or if the letter was ever delivered.  Whether serious or humorous, the letter is frankly sexual:\n\nCensorship\nThe Mistress letter was not the only document by Franklin that later generations censored.  The bawdy portion of Franklin's writing was accepted during his own era.  Although the Mistress letter was not published during his lifetime, Franklin's public works include an essay called \"Fart Proudly\".  A passage from his Autobiography describes an unsuccessful attempt to seduce a friend's mistress.  As John Semonche observes in Censoring Sex: A Historical Journey Through American Media, the autobiography was widely read during the 19th century because of its moral lessons, but the passage about the failed seduction was variously altered or deleted entirely.  The Mistress letter was omitted from 19th century publications of Franklin's works, and by some accounts it was singled out for suppression.\n\nThis censorship occurred both informally and under law.  The first state to enact obscenity legislation was Vermont in 1821.  During the following decades every state except New Mexico adopted similar laws.  Then the Comstock Act of 1873 made it a federal crime to circulate \"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\" material through the mail.\n\nAlthough Franklin had mistresses throughout his life (including one still-unknown mistress who bore his only son William Franklin), such circumstances were incompatible with patriotic sensibilities a century afterward.  Amy Beth Werbel opines bluntly:\n\nCitations\nBy the mid-20th century, United States federal judges were citing the letter in originalist reasoning to overturn obscenity laws.  A Jerome Frank appellate opinion of 1957 named \"Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress\" along with \"The Speech of Polly Baker\" as two examples that would have convicted one of the nation's leading founding fathers on federal obscenity charges if they had been written and mailed under subsequent law.\n\nThe most notable of these citations occurred in the United States Supreme Court case, United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film.  In a dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas states:\n\nIn popular culture\nFranklin appears as a character in Assassin's Creed III (2012), a video game set during the American Revolution. At one point, he has a discussion with the main character about the benefits of older women as sexual partners. Franklin's side of the conversation is an edited version of the Mistress letter.\n\nSee also\nCensorship in the United States\n\nReferences\n\nWorks by Benjamin Franklin\nCensorship in the United States\n1745 works\nSexuality and age\nLetters (message)\n18th-century documents", "machine_text": "Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress Choosing a mistress is a serious affair, and requires careful consideration. If you are considering such a decision, it is important to take into account the various factors that will impact your choice of a mistress. The first and foremost factor to consider is compatibility. You must ensure that you and your potential mistress share common interests and can enjoy each other's company. It is important to remember that a mistress is not just someone to have casual sex with, but rather a companion with whom you can form a meaningful relationship. You must also be honest and clear in your intentions. Be upfront about what you are looking for in a mistress and what you can offer in return. This will help to avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings down the line. Another important factor to consider is discretion. A good mistress will understand the need for privacy and maintain the utmost discretion in your relationship. It is also important to ensure that your mistress is trustworthy and reliable. At all times, it is important to treat your mistress with respect and kindness. Remember that she is a human being with feelings and deserves to be treated as such. Be a good listener and show genuine interest in her life and interests. Ultimately, choosing a mistress is a personal decision that will require careful consideration and thought. It is important to be honest with yourself and your potential mistress, and to make sure that your relationship is based on mutual respect and understanding. By following these guidelines, you can make an informed decision and enjoy a fulfilling relationship with your chosen mistress.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 18509900}

On November 12, it received another co-sponsor bringing the total to 78 (20 Republicans and 58 Democrats).  This act would provide tax credits to support local newspapers:  \n\n Up to $250 per year per individual to cover 80 percent of subscription fees to local newspapers for the first tax year and 50 percent for subsequent tax years (4-1 match the first year, 1-1 match for an additional four years).\n Up to $12,500 per quarter ($50,000 per year) to reduce employment taxes for a local newspaper to hire and pay journalists.\n Up to $5,000 per year for a small business to cover 80 percent of advertising with local media (local newspapers or broadcast stations) the first year after this act takes effect and up to $2,500 per year for another four years to cover 50 percent of such advertising.  \n \nThis act defines a ‘local newspaper’ as any print or digital publication whose (A) primary content is news and current events, and (B) at least 51 percent of its readers (including both print and digital versions) reside in a single (i) State or a single possession of the United States, or (ii) area with a 200-mile radius.  To qualify, a 'local newspaper' must have been in continuous operation for two years prior to the enactment of this bill.\n\nThe bill was reintroduced to the 117th congress in 2021 ( and ).\n\nDiscussion  \n\nOn July 21, 2020, The Arizona Republic discussed this bill, noting that, “More than 150 news companies and papers have undergone pay cuts, furloughs, layoffs or even shut their doors for good as a result of the pandemic, according to the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank.\" More recent reports from the Poynter Institute document further reductions in news. \n\nThe bill is supported by multiple organizations concerned about the decline of local newspapers and the threat that poses to democracy.\n\n David Chavern, the President and CEO of News Media Alliance, wrote, \"As journalists are on the front lines reporting on the coronavirus crisis, ... local news publishers have been dealt a major blow from the contraction of the local advertising market. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act ... would help ensure local news publishers survive the current crises, and that they are around to cover the next ones.\"\n\n Dean Ridings, CEO of America’s Newspapers, reminded readers of what happened to Bell, California, a suburb of Los Angeles with only 37,000 people of modest incomes, after its local newspaper died in 1998 or shortly thereafter:  When the Los Angeles Times started reporting on it in  2010, the city was almost bankrupt in spite of major tax increases, because the city council had voted huge increases in annual compensation to roughly $100,000 for council members, $450,000 for the police chief, and almost $800,000 for the city manager.\n\n Other supporters include Editor & Publisher, an American monthly magazine serving the newspaper industry, and the Hoosier State Press Association. \n\nJack Shafer, who writes about media for Politico, said, “Nobody will miss newspapers more than me when they finally vanish.” However, publishers and journalist may not honestly report on certain issues and events, given the history of politicians (usually Republicans like Mr. Trump) threatening to defund NPR and PBS when they don't like the coverage. He asked, \"You wouldn't put a dead man on a ventilator, would you?\" Editor and Publisher Magazine took position to Shafer's opinions about the eventual death of newspapers in a 2020 editorial penned by Publisher Mike Blinder, which stated \"there are thousands of smaller community newspapers that are still operating with decent profits and serving their communities that lack other news outlets.\" And went on to cite: \"Community publishers generally operate with much more efficiencies than the big market dailies and have better relationships with the local advertising community. Plus, they perform a necessary, critical service (as mandated in the Constitution) of making the local government accountable to the people they serve, or as some say: “Speak truth to power.” These are the cities and counties that must continue to have an authoritative, credible voice through this crisis and beyond.\n\nSee also  \n\nWikiversity:Local Journalism Sustainability Act, an annotated transcript of a virtual (Zoom) forum on this and related issues.\n\nNotes  \n\nProposed legislation of the 116th United States Congress\nProposed legislation of the 117th United States Congress", "machine_text": "The Local Journalism Sustainability Act is a bill introduced in the US Congress in 2021 with the aim of supporting the survival of local newspapers and media outlets. The proposed legislation is sponsored by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) in the Senate and Representative Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ) in the House of Representatives. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act seeks to provide a tax credit for local news organizations that employ journalists and publish local news. The credit can be used to cover payroll and benefits costs, as well as subscriptions to wire services and other journalism-related expenses. The tax credit would be available to for-profit and non-profit media outlets. The bill is designed to combat the current trend of declining revenue and the closure of local newspapers, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 2,100 local newspapers have closed in the US since 2004, and many others have reduced their staff or cut back on coverage. This has resulted in so-called \"news deserts,\" areas without access to local news sources. Supporters of the Local Journalism Sustainability Act argue that local news is essential for a healthy democracy, providing citizens with the information they need to make informed decisions on matters such as elections, public policy, and community affairs. They also argue that the bill will create jobs and help to revitalize local economies. Critics of the bill argue that it is a form of government intervention in the media industry and that it may be used to support media outlets that are politically biased. They also argue that the tax credit may not be enough to keep struggling newspapers afloat. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act is currently being considered by Congress, and its chances of passage remain uncertain. However, supporters of the bill are encouraged by the fact that it has bipartisan support and that it has been endorsed by a number of media organizations and advocacy groups.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 65308936}

Foreigners call “China town” as “Tang People Street”, and naturally call Chinese clothing “Tangzhuang”. In southern China and among the Chinese diaspora, dialects like Cantonese refer to ethnic Chinese—as opposed to all Chinese nationals—as \"Tang people\" rather than \"Han\". It is thus also sometimes translated as a  After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call the garment the \"new tangzhuang\" or  but neither name lasted. Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of traditional Chinese clothing.\n\nHistory\n\nMagua\n\nThe tangzhuang is an adaption of the Manchu \"horse jacket\" (magua), a waist- or three-quarter-length front-opening jacket or surcoat. This was initially worn—usually in a dark blue color—by Manchu horsemen, but became mandatory for Han officials' clothing under the Qing Empire. Over time, it evolved from a protective apron for the changshan into an item of Chinese fashion in its own right and even a mark of imperial favor. Its use then spread among the common Han, including among the Chinese diaspora abroad. \n\nFollowing the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the \"Mao suit\" (Zhōngshān zhuāng) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts. After the fall of the Gang of Four in the late 1970s and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s, traditional clothing began to experience a revival in mainland China. Variants of the magua became noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s.\n\n2001 APEC Summit\n\nIn 1993, US president Bill Clinton tried to bring trade talks back on track by inviting the heads of the APEC member economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented each with a leather bomber jacket bearing the APEC logo as a memento. The next year, Indonesia followed suit and presented batik shirts; the world leaders then humored Suharto's request that they wear them for a group photo. The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present traditional and representative clothes from their cultures, and the leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of solidarity.\n\nAhead of the first occasion of China's hosting the summit in 2001, state-run media acquainted the Chinese with the custom, prompting speculation as to what China's \"traditional clothes\" might be: Mao suits had been displaced by western-style suits; minority groups often had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of Han clothing (hànfú) had varied from dynasty to dynasty, with the most recent Qing forms heavily influenced by the Manchus and their oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40 presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year, their foreign origin or political connotations led officials to select an \"ambiguously traditional\" design by Shanghainese clothiers Li Jianqin (, Lǐ Jiànqín) and Yu Ying (t s Yú Yīng) and by five others at Qinyi (t s Qínyì Fúshì) and the Shanghai Garment Group (t s Shànghǎi Fúzhuāng Jítuán). \n\nThe jackets given to the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made from silk supposedly artificially enhanced to be stronger, softer, more wrinkle-resistant, more water-absorbent, and better ventilated, with longer-lasting and brighter colors. They featured cotton knotwork instead of buttons and a design of peonies surrounding the letters \"APEC\". The jackets were handmade but not personally sized; instead, they were fitted using stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available in case those measurements were mistaken. The leaders had a choice among scarlet, azure, green, brown, maroon, and black versions; each came in a matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an off-white silk shirt to wear beneath it. The 20 attendees—the leaders of all the APEC member economies except \"Chinese Taipei\"—mostly opted for the red-and-black or blue-and-gold design and wore the jackets to their meetings at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum on 21 October 2001 and for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" afterwards that closed the event.\n\nTangzhuang craze\nThe tangzhuang's use as the representative unisex Chinese clothing for the \"Leaders' Family Portrait\" immediately led to its more widespread popularity, spreading from Beijing to other large towns around the country as far afield as Lanzhou in Gansu by the next Chinese New Year. This \"tangzhuang craze\" (t s tángzhuāng rè) saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become fashionable daily wear for both sexes, which gave a large boost to the domestic silk industry. The original designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to capitalize on their creation's popularity, but the fad was short-lived and most had moved on by 2004.\n\nSubsequent history\n\nEven after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place in Chinese fashion. It remained in common use among Jiang Zemin's clique and the nouveau riche, but more especially became a menswear staple on the mainland and abroad for traditional Chinese holidays alongside western and Mao-style suits.\n\nThe tangzhuang—and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing—is also credited by members of the hanfu movement with having inspired their cause and a revival of actual traditional Han clothing, despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin. (Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with Japanese kimonos and Ming clothes with Korean hanboks.)\n\nChina used the \"Tang suit jackets\" again for its 2014 APEC summit, but with an updated style in maroon, green, and blue that The Guardian unflatteringly compared to Star Trek uniforms.\n\nStyle\n\nThe APEC jackets were intended to reflect \"both traditional Chinese flavor and modern ideals\". They have straight Mandarin collars, similar to those on the changshan and magua that gave the style its name. Unlike the traditional 2D \"flat-cutting\"  píngmiàn cáijiǎn) process used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D \"solid-cutting\" (t s lìtǐ cáijiǎn) process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ draping, darts, and set-in sleeves cut separately from the rest of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional Chinese designs. The original version also employed shoulder pads to give a stronger silhouette.\n\nAlthough the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial fibers, silk tangzhuang have since outsold those made from cotton and other materials. Tangzhuang are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red or blue. The brocade is often decorated with a repeated pattern of embroidery. Common designs involve the repetition of auspicious Chinese characters such as fú (, \"happiness\") or shòu (t, s, \"longevity\") for good luck and good wishes. Tangzhuang are usually fastened with decorative knotwork instead of buttons.\n\nTangzhuang are usually considered menswear but they may also be worn by women, as by New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark at APEC 2001.\n\nSee also \n Chinese clothing\n Hanfu, also meaning \"Han clothing\"\n Ru - Chinese upper garment\n Chinese button knot\n Color in Chinese culture\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n . \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n\nChinese clothing\nJackets\n21st-century fashion", "machine_text": "Tangzhuang is a traditional style of Chinese clothing that has been around for centuries. Tangzhuang, also known as Zhongshan suit, is named after Sun Yat-sen, who was also known as Sun Zhongshan, the founder of the Republic of China. This style of clothing is often worn for formal and semi-formal occasions such as weddings, business meetings, and ceremonies. Tangzhuang is made up of a jacket and pants. The jacket has a straight collar and usually has four pockets. The pants are wide-legged and loose-fitting. The jacket is often made of silk or cotton and can be embroidered with various designs. Tangzhuang has a long and rich history in Chinese culture. It is believed that Tangzhuang was popularized during the Qing Dynasty in the 19th century. It was worn by officials and scholars who wanted to distinguish themselves from the common people. Tangzhuang then became popular among the general public in the early 20th century. Tangzhuang has undergone many changes over the years. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was modified to fit the Western-style suit. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was further modified to fit the Mao suit, a style that was popularized during the Communist era. Today, Tangzhuang is once again gaining popularity in China and abroad. It is often worn as a symbol of Chinese culture and tradition. Many fashion designers are incorporating Tangzhuang elements into their designs and creating modern versions of this classic style. In conclusion, Tangzhuang is a timeless and versatile style of Chinese clothing that has been popular for centuries. Its unique design and rich history make it a popular choice for formal and semi-formal occasions. Its popularity is likely to continue to grow as more and more people around the world discover and appreciate Chinese culture.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10983937}

It has thick, fleshy leaves that grow in a flat rosette at the base of the stem. The stem itself is slender and erect, and bears a cluster of tiny flowers at its apex. The flowers are generally green or brown in colour, with a faint sweet fragrance. The species is found in a variety of habitats across south-eastern Australia, including heathland, shrubland, and open forest. It is particularly common in the state of Victoria, where it is found in the eastern part of the state. It is also found in Tasmania, South Australia, and New South Wales. Prasophyllum mimulum is not considered to be threatened in the wild, and there are no major threats to its survival. However, as with many orchid species, it is vulnerable to habitat loss due to land clearance, and is also threatened by the spread of invasive plant species. Prasophyllum mimulum is not commonly cultivated, but is occasionally grown by enthusiasts as a challenging plant to cultivate. It requires a well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter, and prefers a cool, moist environment with plenty of shade.

Nicknamed \"Prime Evil\" by the press, De Kock was the commanding officer of C10, a counter-insurgency unit of the SAP that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered numerous anti-apartheid activists from the 1980s to the early 1990s. C10's victims included members of the African National Congress.\n\nFollowing South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994, De Kock disclosed the full scope of C10's crimes while testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In 1996, he was tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212 years in prison. Since beginning his sentence, De Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former State President F. W. de Klerk, of permitting C10's activities. In 2015, he was granted parole, and is currently released .\n\nEarly life and service\nEugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a magistrate and personal friend to former prime minister John Vorster. Vosloo \"Vossie\" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a \"quiet\" boy who \"wasn't a violent person.\" He also recounted how their father, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond, indoctrinated the boys in Afrikaner nationalist ideology and taught them \"strict Afrikaans\" as they grew up.\n\nDe Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in Pretoria at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to Rhodesia's border with Botswana to confront militant ANC incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the South African Defence Force. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in Saldanha Bay because of a stutter, and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the South African Police's uniform branch in the Eastern Cape. \n\nDe Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, De Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant.\n\nIn May 1978, De Kock was transferred to South West Africa and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded Koevoet, an SAP counterinsurgency unit tasked with combating the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) during the South African Border War. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but committed atrocities against civilians and other human rights violations. Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.\n\nVlakplaas\n\nIn 1983, the SAP transferred De Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called Vlakplaas, located  west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10—later known as C1—became a death squad which hunted down and killed opponents of the National Party and the apartheid system.\n\nTRC testimony\nDe Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998, during which he made multiple revelations relating to ANC deaths.\n\nDe Kock has been interviewed a number of times by psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, who ended up releasing a book, A Human Being Died That Night, about her interviews with De Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentencing\nUpon being convicted on 30 October 1996, De Kock was sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison for crimes against humanity. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of a firearm, and fraud. De Kock served his sentence in the C Max section of the Pretoria Central Prison.\n\nImprisonment\nIn a local radio interview in July 2007, De Kock claimed that former president FW de Klerk's hands were \"soaked in blood\" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the anti-apartheid conflict. These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a \"clear conscience\" regarding his time in office.\n\nThe Sunday Independent reported in January 2010 that De Kock was seeking a presidential pardon from President Jacob Zuma in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated De Kock took place in April 2009. A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.\n\nIn 2012, De Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims. In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted De Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown remorse. In February, De Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.\n\nIn September 2014, De Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims. Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.\n\nParole\nJustice Minister Michael Masutha announced on 30 January 2015, that De Kock had been granted parole. At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public. Masutha further said that De Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims. De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.\n\nSee also\nDirk Coetzee\nCraig Williamson\nCivil Cooperation Bureau\nWouter Basson\nLothar Neethling\nJanusz Waluś\nSiphiwe Mvuyane\n\nReferences\n\n1949 births\nSouth African prisoners and detainees\nLiving people\nAfrikaner people\nPolice officers convicted of crimes against humanity\nSouth African people of Dutch descent\nSouth African people convicted of crimes against humanity\nPrisoners and detainees of South Africa\nSouth African police officers convicted of crimes\nPeople who testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)\nTorturers", "machine_text": "Eugene Alexander de Kock is a former colonel in the South African Police Service (SAPS) and a convicted murderer.

Work on them continued under German control but progressed slowly, being subject to reluctance, or even sabotage, by the French workforce. Eventually only four were completed. The ships were commissioned in 1943–44 and deployed as escort vessels. Three were bombed and sunk by Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft in 1944; the fourth was sunk as a block ship at Le Havre later the same year.\n\nBackground\nThe PA-class patrol vessels were originally laid down as part of a 1939 order by the French Navy for anti-submarine warfare vessels to a British design, called s in the Royal Navy. They were adapted from a merchant ship design and were suitable for building at merchant yards.\n\nOf the 18 ships ordered, 12 were under construction at British and six at French yards, four of which were at Chantier de St Nazaire-Penhoët. The order was overtaken by events, and none of the ships ordered was completed before the fall of France in June 1940. Saint-Nazaire, with four ships still under construction, fell into German hands, and as the town was in the occupied zone the Germans decided to complete the vessels for use by the German Kriegsmarine.\n\nDesign\nThe PA-class ships differed in several respects from the original Smiths Dock design, and therefore from the Flower-class corvettes in service with the Allies. This reflects their construction history and their intended use. The PAs retained the short forecastle which was a feature of the original design, but which the Royal Navy found impractical in heavy weather. Later Allied vessels were given a longer forecastle, and the early ships were altered as they refitted. This did not happen with the PAs, which retained the un-weatherly short forecastle throughout their service careers. The PAs had another original feature, the enclosed merchant-style bridge, though it was abandoned in Allied ships.\n\nThe focus of the PA class's role was as inshore and coastal escorts, where the chief danger was from mines or attack by aircraft and small craft, such as motor torpedo boats and gunboats. A number of changes to their armament and layout were made to reflect this. The PAs were equipped with minesweeping gear, and to accommodate these items the upswept stern gunwale, a characteristic of the original design, was cut away, producing a flat quarterdeck and simple wire rails. The PAs also had an enhanced anti-aircraft (AA) armament; two sets of twin 37 mm AA guns were fitted in a flying bridge amidships and a set of quadruple 20 mm guns was fitted aft. They also had a 20 mm quadruple mount in a tub set on the roof of the bridge; given the Flowers' reputation for rolling in any seas, putting such a weight so high up would have done no good for their seaworthiness.\n\nService history\nOn completion the four PAs had relatively short service careers. After a four-year building period, none of the ships was in service longer than nine months. The first to be completed, PA 2, joined  (\"15th Outpost Flotilla\") in September 1943, and took part in general patrol and escort duties, protecting coastal traffic against air and small craft attack in the English Channel. She was joined by PA 3 in November 1943 and PA 1 in April 1944.\n\nThe ships took part in a number of naval actions. In September 1943 PA 2 was part of a force escorting the freighter Maladi in the Channel when they were attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats. One escort was damaged in the action and Maladi was sunk. In January 1944 PA 3 was part of a force that escorted the blockade-runner Münsterland up the Channel, though Münsterland was protected from ships it was sunk by the coastal artillery at Dover. In February PA 2 and PA 3 were with a force that successfully fought off an attack on the tanker Reckum, bringing her safely to Le Havre. The tanker was later sunk by the Dover batteries.\n\nIn June 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy, German naval units in the area came under persistent air attack. During RAF air raids at Le Havre PA 2 - along with six other escorts - was sunk on 15 June and PA 3 was irreparably damaged on 15–16 June. PA 1 survived until August, but was abandoned when the flotilla fled the town ahead of the Allied advance. PA 4 was unfinished when Nantes was liberated. She was launched as La Télindière and sunk as a blockship in April 1945. She was raised and scrapped in 1946.\n\nShips in class\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nWorld War II patrol vessels of Germany\n1940s ships", "machine_text": "PA-class patrol ship (Germany) The PA-class patrol ship is a German naval vessel built by the Lürssen shipbuilding company.

Some breeds from outside the country were introduced in the 1950s but did not bring beneficial results, so the Guizhou is still bred in pure form and is classified as a native breed.\n\nUses\n\nIn plantation areas the horses were used mainly for cultivation and transport. In hilly regions this breed has always been a good pack horse, somewhat smaller than the type used for agricultural purposes. The Guizhou horse is active and vigorous, good for travel in hilly regions, and can trot at a steady speed for long distances. This breed is the main power source for the mountain farmers.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nApproximately half of the Guizhou horses are bay or chestnut, others being gray, black, and dun. This horse is compact and short bodied with a solid build. The head has a straight profile, ears small and set up. In the riding type the neck tends to be sloped, while the pack type has a level neck. The withers are medium in height and length; the chest is of good width and depth; the rump is short and sloping but well muscled; the shoulder is short and tends to be straight. The forelegs have good posture while the hind legs are often sickled; the hoof is solid and tough and shoes are unnecessary even in the mountains. The skin is thin; mane and tail are think.

History The Guizhou pony has a long and rich history in China. For centuries, it has been used by local people as a pack animal, transportation, and for agricultural purposes. The breed played a significant role in the development of Guizhou province, a remote region known for its mountains, forests, and rugged terrain. The breed was considered so valuable that it was often used as a form of currency in trade and commerce. Current Status Today, the Guizhou pony is recognized as a breed by the Chinese government and is protected by law. The breed is still used for a variety of purposes, including transportation, agriculture, and as a tourist attraction. However, the breed is facing threats from modernization, urbanization, and cross-breeding with other horse breeds. Conservation Efforts Efforts are being made to preserve and protect the Guizhou pony from extinction.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cinema of Tunisia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The cinema of Tunisia began in 1896, when the Lumière brothers began showing animated films in the streets of Tunis.\n\nHistory\nIn 1919, the first feature-length movie produced in North Africa: Les Cinq gentlemen maudits (The Five Accursed Gentlemen) was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length film called Ain Al-Ghazal (The Girl from Carthage) thus making him, one of the first native filmmakers in North African. In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film (95 minutes) Al-Fajr (The Dawn) was directed and produced by Omar Khlifi; it was shot on a 35 mm film. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from Arab-speaking and African countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent.\n\nIn 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by Société Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cinématographique (SATPEC) which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer Tarak Ben Ammar, a nephew of Wasila Bourguiba, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot inside his studios in Monastir. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including Roman Polanski's Pirates and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth. After visiting Tunisia George Lucas was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some Southern Tunisian towns where he decided to film important scenes of Star Wars, as well as Indiana Jones. Moreover, Anthony Minghella filmed the nine Academy Awards winner The English Patient in a south-west oasis of the country.\n\nDomestic productions were rare: the few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research, and modernity shock. Some of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, such as La Goulette (Halq El-Wadi 1996) directed by Ferid Boughedir which showed a flashback of typical community life in the small suburb of La Goulette in a period where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces (Asfour Stah 1990), also by Boughedir, is possibly the biggest success in the history of Tunisian cinema. The movie showed the life of a child from the Halfaouine suburb of Tunis in the 60s, on a quest to understand relationships, the world of women, and how to be a man. In another earlier movie entitled Man of Ashes (Rih Essedd 1986) Boughedir again depicted Tunisian society without fear or favour, covering prostitution, paedophilia, and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991 film Bezness, he talked about the emerging sexual tourism inside the country. The Ambassadors (As-Soufraa 1975) directed by Naceur Ktari portrayed the life of immigrant Maghrebins in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture during the Carthage Film Festival in 1976, the special jury award from the Locarno International Film Festival in the same year and it has been classified in the Un Certain Regard category during the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe first Tunisian actress was Haydée Chikly, who starred in the short film, Zohra in 1922. The first feature film to be directed by a woman was Fatma 75 (1975) by Selma Baccar. Subsequent female directors films such as Néjia Ben Mabrouk's Sama (1988) and Moufida Tlatli's The Silences of Palace (1994).\n\nIn 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention, such as Making Of, directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib Belkadi's VHS Kahloucha.\n\nIn 2013, Abdellatif Kechiche was the first-ever Tunisian director to win the Palme D'Or award. For his film Blue Is the Warmest Colour he split the award with his two lead actresses.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the country opened its first City of Culture, a project one of its kind in Africa and the Arab world , located in downtown Tunis.

Although Tunisia's film industry has been much less well-known and smaller than its powerful counterparts, the country has had a thriving film industry that has produced around 110 feature films and a variety of award-winning documentaries and short films. Tunisia's cinema was inspired in the 1920s by French colonial authorities who introduced the art and science of film-making. During the colonial period, Tunisians were identified only as characters of the French nation and had a quite limited presence in the films. When Tunisia obtained independence, cultural practices changed dramatically. The explosion of the independent cinema movement in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with another key historical event in Tunisia, the end of colonial domination and the establishment of the Tunisian Republic. In this context, the establishment of institutions, particularly the National Center for Cinema and Image (CNCI), provided new support systems which helped the industry to consolidate and produce more high-quality films. The Tunisian cinema experienced its true golden age in the 1980s and early 1990s, when movies from the region were showcased at notable international film festivals and impressed audiences in the West and the Arab world alike. Among the country's most iconic films are \"Halfaouine,\" \"Chronicle of the Years of Fire,\" and \"Golden Horseshoes.\" Tunisian cinema is renowned for its close study of the social and political structures of Tunisian society and the postcolonial world in general. Themes range from the political background and national struggle for independence to the progressive forces of society. In conclusion, Tunisian cinema is an example of the remarkable accomplishments its people have achieved in the world of artistic expression, both in the past and today.

The single-camera setup refers to the use of one camera to shoot each shot, in contrast to multi-camera setups, which typically use multiple cameras for every shot. The award has been presented since 2003 and has been won by many notable editors, such as David Rogers for \"Sex and the City\", Steven Rasch for \"Arrested Development\", and William Turro for \"The Office\". The criteria for nomination include the pace and rhythm of the editing, as well as its ability to effectively support the comedic aspects of the series. The editing should also work seamlessly with the other aspects of the production, such as the writing, acting, and cinematography. In recent years, the category has become increasingly competitive as more comedies have adopted the single-camera format. Notable nominees in recent years include \"Atlanta\", \"Master of None\", \"Barry\", and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\". Winning the award can have a significant impact on the careers of the editors involved, raising their visibility and potentially opening up new opportunities. It can also provide recognition for the technical aspects of television production that are often overlooked or taken for granted. Overall, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series is an important recognition of the contributions of editors to the continued success of television comedy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26739785}

She was sold for scrapping in 1973.\n\nNamesake\nCarl Welby Tinsman was born on 29 March 1924 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 19 August 1942 and served on the destroyer  as a seaman second class. While patrolling some  off the coast of Brazil on 10 March 1943, Eberle, ,  and  intercepted the German blockade runner Karin, flying a Dutch flag. Eberle and Savannah closed on the ship at flank speed and fired warning shots across her bow. Karins crew promptly set her afire and began to abandon ship. Tinsman was a member of the 14-man party from Eberle which boarded the blazing ship and attempted to save the ship. He continued his efforts to put out the fire until a sudden explosion of a demolition charge killed him. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHistory\nTinsman was laid down by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Hingham, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1943; launched on 26 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James Corley, sister of Seaman Tinsman; and commissioned on 26 June 1944.\n\nFollowing fitting out and trials, the destroyer got underway on 21 July 1944, proceeded to Bermuda on shakedown, and returned to Boston on 19 August. On 11 October, she departed Boston harbor and, the next day, joined a convoy bound, via the Panama Canal, for the South Pacific. She arrived at Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands late in November and, after training exercises, headed for New Guinea. On 2 December, she reached Hollandia, and was soon at sea again escorting a convoy to Leyte.\n\nOn 14 December, while Tinsman was in San Pedro Bay, a kamikaze plane grazed the bridge of a nearby tanker. A week later, the destroyer escort was back in New Guinea waters, anchoring in Humboldt Bay. The day after Christmas, she was on the move again, this time for waters off the Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea for antisubmarine patrol.\n\nIn the first days of the new year, she escorted a convoy to San Pedro Bay; then, on 6 January 1945, she departed Leyte to screen a convoy bound for Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. On 12 January—as Tinsman escorted a slow-moving group consisting of an oiler, tugs, and tows—kamikaze planes attacked her convoy. During the day, the American ships fought off four Japanese attackers, downing two of the planes. On the 13th, Tinsman's guns downed another Japanese aircraft. On the 14th, Tinsman anchored in Lingayen Gulf and retired the next day toward Leyte, arr:ving in San Pedro Bay on the 18th to prepare for the Bandings at Nasugbu, Luzon.\n\nTinsman departed Leyte Gulf on 27 January 1945 with Amphibious Group 8 and, on the 31st, arrived at Nasugbu Bay where troops of the 11th Airborne Division landed without serious opposition. That night a large number of Japanese Shinyo boats attacked the American ships. Armed with impact bombs, these small craft swarmed out of the darkness and attacked  as she patrolled not far from Tinsman. Tinsman provided illumination to assist Lough in defending herself, sinking at least six of the vessels. Tinsman departed Luzon on 2 February in a convoy bound for Mindoro. Throughout February, she shuttled between Mangarin Bay and Nasugbu Bay on escort duty.\n\nEarly in March, she left Leyte Gulf, bound for New Guinea. After taking on stores at Hollandia, Tinsman returned to the Philippines and resumed escort duty. In mid-April, she made a voyage to Palau; and, in July, she varied her routine of convoy duty with visits to Ulithi and Hollandia before returning to the Philippines.\n\nAlthough the war ended in August, Tinsman remained in the Far East, operating mainly in the Philippines. She also made voyages to Hollandia and Tientsin before setting course for home on 29 November. Steaming via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 18 December 1945.\n\nShe was later berthed at San Diego, where she was placed out of commission on 11 May 1946. On 15 May 1972, her name was struck from the Navy List; and, on 14 September 1973, her hulk was sold to Levin Metals Corporation, San Jose, California, for scrapping.\n\nTinsman received two battle stars for World War II service.\n\nSee also\n\nList of destroyer escorts of the United States Navy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Photo gallery at navsource.org\n\nRudderow-class destroyer escorts\n1944 ships", "machine_text": "USS Tinsman (DE-589) was an American destroyer escort ship that served during World War II. She was named in honor of Ensign William Edward Tinsman, a naval aviator who died during the Battle of the Coral Sea. The ship was built by the Consolidated Steel Corporation in Orange, Texas, and was commissioned on February 17, 1944. She was 306 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a crew of 222 officers and enlisted personnel. Tinsman was armed with two 5-inch guns, two twin 40mm guns, and ten 20mm guns, and was equipped with depth charges and torpedoes. Tinsman was initially assigned to escort duties in the Atlantic, protecting convoys from German U-boats. She also served in the Mediterranean, providing escort for the invasion of southern France in August 1944. In January 1945, Tinsman was transferred to the Pacific theater, where she was engaged in anti-submarine warfare and gunnery training. Tinsman was decommissioned on June 7, 1946, and was sold for scrapping on December 18 of the same year. Her service during World War II was honored with three battle stars. The USS Tinsman serves as a reminder of the sacrifice and dedication of the brave men and women who served in the United States Navy during World War II.

He was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the first trip from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. He was the only animal to complete the entire trip, which took 3 years.\n\nSeaman was purchased in 1803 specifically for the expedition by Captain Meriwether Lewis, while he was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, awaiting completion of the boats for the voyage. He chose a Newfoundland, whose estimated weight is  and for which he paid the high price of $20 (): half a month's pay for an Army captain. Working dogs, strong and easy to handle—Lewis describes Seaman as \"docile\"—, he chose a Newfoundland because they do well on boats, are good swimmers, and can assist in water rescues. His name reflects this.\n\nWe have no description of Seaman's color or appearance. He is nowadays universally depicted as black or dark brown, the colors of most modern Newfoundlands, but a survey by an art historian of the breed as it was depicted in paintings of the early nineteenth century found \"not a single all-black [that] was called a Newfoundland\". \"In fact, all the early 19th century illustrations which I have found, and whose color I could authenticate[,] were white with black or dark areas and frecklings.\"\n\nSeaman on the expedition\nSeaman did many things to help the explorers, and they became fond of him. He was \"our dog\".\n\nHe also retrieved geese and deer, and once killed and retrieved an antelope swimming across a river.\n\nAccording to Lewis and Clark's report, some Native Americans were impressed by the dog's \"sagacity\" (wisdom, obedience); they had never seen such a big dog. The dog \"patrolled all night\" to warn of bears, and once had to drive off a buffalo in their camp while the men slept.\n\nA modern commentator on the Expedition remarked that \"Lewis seems to have been happiest when he was alone on shore with his gun, his notebook, and his dog Seaman.\"\n\nDuring the expedition, around May 14, 1805, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark performed surgery on one of Seaman's arteries in his hind leg that had been severed by a beaver bite. In early 1806, as the expedition was beginning the return journey, Seaman was stolen by Indians and Lewis sent three men to retrieve the dog.  Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery ate over 200 dogs, bought from the Indians, while traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail, in addition to their horses, but Seaman was spared.\n\nThe final reference to Seaman in the expedition journals, recorded by Lewis on July 15, 1806, states that \"[T]he musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist. for my own part I am confined by them to my bier at least 3/4 of the time. My dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them.\"\n\nSeaman after the expedition\nSeaman survived the expedition, and Lewis took the dog home with him to St. Louis. He is reported to have refused food and died of grief after Lewis's premature death.\n\nSeaman's inscribed collar was once in an Alexandria, D.C., museum:\n\nThe greatest traveller of my speciesMy name is SEAMANthe dog of captain Meriwether Lewiswhom I accompanied to the Pacific Oceanthrough the interior of the continent of North America\n\nThe mistaken name \"Scannon\"\n\nDue to a transcription error in Lewis' journals, the dog was once thought to have been named Scannon. However, during Donald Jackson's 1984 study of Lewis and Clark place-names in Montana—every expedition member got something named after him—he found that Lewis had named a tributary of the Blackfoot River Seaman’s Creek (now Monture Creek) and concluded that the true name of the dog was \"Seaman\".\n\nHonors\nIn 2008, Seaman became the official mascot of Lewis & Clark College's Pioneers. He was proposed unsuccessfully for State Historical Dog of Missouri.\n\nMonuments to or including Seaman:\n A  bronze sculpture of Meriweather Lewis accompanied by Seaman, \"Lewis the Naturalist\", by Chinese-American sculptor Kwan Wu, was reported in 2000 to have been on permanent display at the White House.

Born in 1801 in Newfoundland, Seaman was a black Newfoundland dog who was bought by Meriwether Lewis as a present for his friend and fellow explorer William Clark. But Seaman soon became an integral member of the expedition, accompanying the explorers on their journey from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean and back. Seaman's loyalty, courage, and obedience helped make him a favorite among the men of the expedition and he became a symbol of the true meaning of a faithful companion. Seaman proved to be an excellent hunter and fisherman, helping the expedition survive on many occasions. He also served as a watchdog and was a comforting presence to the men on long, lonely nights. In one instance, Seaman saved Lewis from being attacked by a grizzly bear by chasing the bear away with his barks. Beyond his hunting and companionship skills, Seaman became an ambassador for his breed, with his friendly demeanor and intelligence making him famous across the country. He is considered to be one of the best-known dogs in American history, and his contribution to the success of the Lewis and Clark Expedition is well known and celebrated by dog lovers and historians alike. After the expedition, Seaman returned with Lewis to his home in St. Louis and lived with him until Lewis's tragic death in 1809. The dog's fate following Lewis's death is not known, but his contribution to the expedition and his status as a true American hero remains a significant legacy. Today, Seaman is remembered and celebrated in various ways, including a statue in the Lewis and Clark State Park in Oregon, a street named after him in Winter Garden, Florida, and being honored as the \"Official State Dog\" of Maine.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4317451}

Description The false dittany plant grows up to 50 cm tall and has oval-shaped leaves, with toothed edges and a felty texture. The flowers grow in clusters on the tip of the stems and are usually whitish with purple spots. The plant is drought-tolerant and prefers rocky, well-drained soil. Uses The false dittany plant has been used in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic and sedative properties. It is also believed to have anti-inflammatory effects and has been used as a remedy for common respiratory problems such as bronchitis and asthma. The leaves are used in the preparation of herbal teas and tinctures. Apart from its medicinal uses, false dittany is also used as a decorative plant, particularly in rock gardens. It is valued for its attractive flowers and velvety leaves. The plant is easy to grow and requires minimal care. Conservation Although not considered endangered, the false dittany plant faces threats from habitat loss due to human activities, such as urbanization, farming, and grazing. It is also collected from the wild for its medicinal properties, which can lead to overexploitation. Conclusion Ballota pseudodictamnus is a plant species with significant importance in traditional medicine and horticulture. While not in immediate danger of extinction, efforts must be made to protect the plant and its natural habitat to ensure its continued existence for future generations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 56358007}

After independence in 1960, Radio Nationale du Mali (Radio-Mali) began broadcasting from la maison de la Radio in the Bozola neighbourhood of Bamako.  Technical abilities were bolstered with Czech transmitters ranging from 18 to 30 kilowatts in 1962.\n\nIn 1970, the Chinese government constructed four 50 kW radio transmitters about 7 km from Bamako, towards Kati, enabling Radio Mali to reach much of West Africa. In 22 September 1983, a Libyan financed television broadcast centre was opened in Bamako, enabling RTM to broadcast one channel of colour television. French and German grant programmes between 1984 and 1990 enabled news and reporting to expand, with regional stations opening in Ségou (1986), Koulikoro (1989), Sikasso (1990) and Mopti (1993). In 1992, a second national broadcast radio network (Chiffre II) was added.\n\nOn 5 October 1992, the Malian government split off the RTM  according to \"Law 92-021\", from direct government control, becoming a publicly financed, independently run entity (an \"Établissement Public à Caractère Administratif (EPA)\"). This was part of the national liberalisation process, moving the nation to the \"Third Malian Republic\". Private broadcasters were legalised, and RTM was reorganised as the ORTM on 1 January 1993.\n\nORTM was seized by National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR) forces on 21 March 2012 as part of the 2012 Malian coup d'état. A thousand-person protest was held on 26 March, chanting \"Down with Sanogo\" and \"Liberate the ORTM\".\n\nCurrent output\nIn 2002, ORTM had 35 local radio and/or television broadcast points or repeaters, with TV/radio broadcast points in all eight Regions of Mali.  From its headquarters in Bamako, ORTM produces two radio networks (RTM and Chiffre II), a national television network (RTM), and directs the work of a number of regional RTM radio stations.\n\nConsidered one of the freest news markets in Africa, although government office holders threaten (and sometimes resort to) prosecution of broadcasters under Mali's strict anti-libel laws.  In 2001, the head of OTRM was threatened with jail after the government attempted to prosecute RTM for an interview in which the mayor of Bamako accused the Malian judiciary of corruption.  Since 1992, broadcasting is no longer a state monopoly.  There are two large private multi-channel television providers, and numerous private radio stations.  Mali is also considered a world leader in community radio development, with ORTM helping to set up the Union des Radios et Televisions Libres (URTEL) , a network of over a hundred independently locally operated stations.  OTRM also partners with other government and international organisations in education and development programs throughout Mali.\n\nProgramming\nRTM Radio and television broadcast news and information programming, light entertainment (both foreign and domestic), music and sport.  Most national broadcasts are in French, with several hours of Bambara language programming, as well as regional broadcasting in other languages. Emission Hebdomadaire d'Information, the weekly ORTM news magazine, has been broadcasting each Sunday at noon since 1998, and is anchored by Manga Dembélé and Youssouf Touré.  A daily news program is broadcast twice daily.  Chiffre II radio network is simulcast on the OTRM website, while television broadcasts are carried on regional satellite.  ORTM television regularly broadcasts local sport, mostly  Malien Première Division football matches, to an eager audience at least three days a week.\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral\n www.ortm.ml/ Office de radiodiffusion et de télévision du Mali.\n Pascal James Imperato,  Historical Dictionary Of Mali.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Andriza Mircovich\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Andriza (or Andrew) Mircovich (,  1879 – May 14, 1913) was an Austro-Hungarian national of Serb descent. He was the only prisoner ever to be executed by shooting in the US state of Nevada. He had been sentenced to death for the premeditated murder of John Gregovich in Tonopah, Nevada. Mircovich felt that he was owed more money from Gregovich's administration of his late cousin's estate and resorted to settling the matter by stabbing Gregovich to death.\n\nA 1911 statute was passed by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a death row inmate to opt to die by shooting or hanging; that statute was repealed in 1921. Mircovich was insistent on shooting, claiming that hanging often took too long. After the Nevada State Prison warden, George W. Cowing, was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution.\n\nBackground\n\nAndriza Mircovich was a 31-year-old miner and a recent immigrant to the US from Austria-Hungary. Mircovich spoke little English and was barely literate in his native Serbian dialect. His cousin Christopher Mircovich had died in a fire in the Tonopah Belmont Mine on February 23, 1911. Because Christopher did not have a will, his estate was turned over to Nye County public administrator Arthur H. Keenan. At the recommendation of District Attorney James A. Sanders, Andriza Mircovich and Christopher Mircovich's surviving siblings, Vasso and Maria, met with John Gregovich on May 10, 1911. Gregovich, who also went by the surname Greggory, was a fellow Serb from Castellastva, (now Petrovac), who was handling the cases of other Serbian miners who had died in the fire. Mircovich, who was unfamiliar with the probate laws in Nevada, began cursing Gregovich and Sanders because he was frustrated over being unable to take sole control of the estate.\n\nAt the time of his death, Christopher Mircovich's estate included $520 in cash, and a settlement of $2,000 from the Tonopah Belmont Company. On July 17, 1911, Gregovich issued a check for $50 to Andriza Mircovich, followed by another check for $1,742.50 to Vasso and Maria on July 22. $507.32 was added to the estate for money orders held in Christopher's name. After legal and administrative fees were paid, $966.25 in undisbursed funds remained in the estate. Mircovich believed that he was owed more money and his demands escalated into threats against Gregovich. On November 14, 1911, Gregovich petitioned District Judge Peter J. Sommers, to be released as executor of the estate. Feeling cheated, Mircovich vowed to take matters into his own hands. At that time, South Slavic immigrants traditionally settled disagreements in mining camps by the use of a knife.\n\nDeath of John Gregovich\n\nIn the early morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had a man called J. R. Masterson in conversation.  Mircovich had come to the depot from the cemetery to see who was arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, \"I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!\" He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00 p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he \"wanted to make John Gregovich die\", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.\n\nTrial and sentencing\n\nAt the grand jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case involved capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912, for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the \"manhood\" to \"defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people\" or else \"we might just as well dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as well take his Honor off the bench and say we have no law in Nye County.\"\n\nOn June 15, 1912, Mircovich was convicted of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death by Judge Averill. Mircovich boarded a train to Nevada State Prison in Carson City on June 17 while escorted by Sheriff Malley and prison warden George W. Cowing. Mircovich parted with the statement: \"They will treat me to a shower of cold lead.\" He became nauseated during the trip and begged his captors to shoot him right away, not understanding that attorneys would pursue appeals on his behalf.\n\nAttorney J.E. McNamara argued to the Nevada Supreme Court that Sanders unfairly prejudiced the jury with the statement: \"Why, gentlemen of the jury, if you cannot pronounce by your verdict the death penalty upon this defendant, I say, let's resurrect old Casey [that killed Mrs. Hislop in Goldfield] and let him live again.\" However, the appeal was denied and the lower court decision was upheld, with Justice Pat McCarran abstaining from the opinion.\n\nExecution\nNevada State Prison had been the state-designated facility for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich did not want to be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad.\n\nThe shooting machine\n\nThe state then ordered a rack of rifles that was to be set up on a frame by an Eastern ordnance foundry. The 1000-pound (450 kg) execution machine, which was called the \"shooting gallery of steel\", included three Savage Model 1899 .30-30 caliber rifles with Maxim silencers. When the device arrived at the prison, Cowing no longer wanted to have any part of the execution and resigned. Denver S. Dickerson, a former Nevada governor and prison reformer, was appointed as the new warden. On May 13, 1913, Prison Chaplain Lloyd B. Thomas of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Carson City, Nevada, made an unsuccessful appeal for commutation on Mircovich's behalf with the Board of Pardons.\n\nThe \"shooting machine\" was designed to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: \"I much obligated to you. You be good man to me.\" Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant's heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said \"I die like a soldier\" before he was shot to death.\n\nAftermath\n\nDoctor McLean declared that the death was instantaneous. An autopsy found the two soft-nosed ball cartridges within 2/3 inch (17mm) of each other in Mircovich's heart. Reverend Thomas conducted an informal service at the prison cemetery that afternoon. Mircovich's body was buried in a pine coffin on the same day.\n\nIn a 1915 report to the Nevada Legislature, Dickerson stated that despite his personal reservations, \"executions by shooting are a trifle less barbarous than by hanging and have the further merit of eliminating many of the possibilities of bungling.\" However, the shooting machine was never used again and was placed in storage by the prison quarry. In July 1942, it was donated with 50 tons of scrap metal for a collection drive during World War II. The rifles from the machine were found during an inventory of the prison armory in June 1977 and were donated to the Nevada State Museum in Carson City.\n\nSee also\n\nCapital punishment in Nevada\nCapital punishment in the United States\nGee Jon\nMiranda warning\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n Nevada State Prison Inmate Case Files: Andriza Mircovich at Nevada State Library and Archives\n State of Nevada v.

The award was created in 1950, named after German middle-distance runner Rudolf Harbig, who died age 30 fighting for the Wehrmacht in World War II. The award was suggested by the Clubs der Alten Meister (Old Masters Club), a union of former athletes and made official by Karl Ritter von Halt, the former leader of the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise. Given by the German Athletics Association (DLV), the award was for West German athletes only prior to German reunification.\n\nThe prize may only be awarded once to an athlete, who is selected by an internal German Athletics Association panel. The DLV president gives the award at the German Athletics Championships each year, a tradition started at the championships in 1950. The award was historically mostly been given to men (37 male to 13 female winners in its first 50 years) – prior to 2005, a female winner had succeeded another woman on one occasion only.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Harriet Ward\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Harriet Ward née Tidy (1808 – 1873), was a British writer whose work is sometimes thought of as South African literature. She lived in the Cape Colony for a few years and her best-known books are set there: the non-fiction Five Years in Kaffirland and the fictional Jasper Lyle, the first English novel set entirely in South Africa. She also wrote articles for a military audience, unusually for a woman of that era. Her writing has stimulated discussion about whether or not she agreed fully with British colonial attitudes.\n\nPersonal life \nShe was born at Thorp, Norfolk in 1808 to Colonel and Mrs Francis Skelly Tidy, née Miss Pinder, daughter of the Chief Justice of Barbados. After school in France and London she married John Ward in 1831. He was a military officer from Waterford, Ireland and his wife accompanied him on various postings. They had one daughter, Isabel. The family lived together on St Helena in the late 1830s. In 1842 they travelled from Cork to the eastern frontier of the Cape and spent five years in the British colony there, at Fort Peddie and Grahamstown, in the so-called \"Ceded Territory\". Ward returned to Britain in 1848. This is when she started to publish full-length books, building on previous articles and short stories. The Wards may have lived in Dover before moving to Boulogne-sur-Mer in about 1851, but biographical details are scant. She died in 1873.\n\nWriting\n\nHer first published writing was in The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine in the early 1840s. She began with articles about her father and later contributed reports about war and life in \"Kaffirland\", a British name for an area of the Cape Colony stretching from Kaffraria to Albany. (The name was based on the word Kaffir which the British used to describe the indigenous people of that region.) Ward developed an authoritative voice and was one of the first women whose work was treated as credible war reporting. Some of the writing she did in 1846 and 1847 formed the basis for the book which came out soon after her arrival in England in 1848: Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country to the conclusion of peace: written on the spot.\n\nThis book was well-received in a period of public interest in the \"Kaffir War\" or War of the Axe. and ran to three editions. In the same year Ward's first novel, Helen Charteris, was also published but a reviewer complained that the main romance was \"encumbered\" by sub-plots.  Three years later her novel Jasper Lyle: a tale of Kafirland (sic) was more successful and was described in the Morning Post as \"truthful and popular\" with a \"fidelity and vivacity\" in its descriptions of \"Kaffir life and scenery\", \"giving it at the present moment an especial interest\". This too ran to three editions, plus two more in the 1870s after Ward's death and just before the Zulu War, when UK interest in South Africa was high.\n\nCritics' interpretations of Ward's overall opinions vary. Some see her as \"stridently propagandist\" for British imperialism, particularly in her non-fiction writing about colonial South Africa, while others find more complex attitudes, for instance when the eponymous heroine of Helen Charteris is friendly with a Creole girl. Some believe Ward either felt unable to express unconventional views openly or held inconsistent attitudes without being particularly conscious of it. It has also been suggested she was offering a \"veiled critique\" or even deliberately expressing \"anti-colonial dissidence\". One critic thinks she wrote at first with \"full complicity in the prejudices of the frontier\" but later revealed a \"startling mismatch\" with this in her novels.\n\nSelect bibliography\n\nBooks available online \n\n  Five years in Kaffirland: with sketches of the late war in that country, to the conclusion of peace.

Built at Brest on private plans by Pierre Ozanne, she was particularly fast. The French Navy adopted the design and copied the plans as late as 1848. Originally armed with 6-pounder guns, she was later rearmed with heavier carronades. She continued in service, off and on, until she was struck in 1854.\n\nService history\n\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\nDiligente took part in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 in Leissègues' squadron, culminating in the Battle of San Domingo.\n\nThe frigates , , and Diligente captured and burned the American vessel Lark, Moore, master, which was sailing from Philadelphia to Jamaica.\n\nIn August 1808 Diligente, captained by Commander Jean-François Lemaresquier, with the corvettes  and Espiègle, sailed from France with supplies for the island of Martinique. British ships chased the group through the Bay of Biscay and captured Sylphe and Espiègle. Diligente escaped, only to encounter the British sloop , under Commander (later to be Admiral) Charles Napier, off Antigua. During a hard-fought action lasting three hours, Recruits mainmast fell, putting her somewhat at Diligentes mercy. However, a lucky shot ignited Diligentes ammunition store, causing some damage.  Diligente withdrew and later Lemaresquier justified his action on the grounds that other British naval vessels were approaching, which they were not, and the weight of Recruits broadside, which was heavier.\n\nOn 3 October, Diligente sank the Mexican brig Juliana. Then on 12 November she returned to Lorient. Here she served from 1811 to 1812 as a school ship. On 12 March she was in the harbour at Brest. On 2 December 1812, she accidentally collided with  in the Roads of Toulon.\n\nShe may have cruised in the Channel as  reported that on 20 December 1813 she had retaken and sent in the brig Racehorse, from Newfoundland for Teignmouth, that the French corvette Diligente had captured. In 1814 Diligente was paid off.\n\nBourbon Restoration\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, Diligente underwent refitting at Brest between 22 August 1820 and 4 January 1821. She was recommissioned with 18-pounder carronades and was reclassified as a corvette aviso (sloop corvette). Then on 21 April she left Brest for the Antilles, Guiana and Newfoundland. By 30 August 1822 she was in the Antilles again.\n\nOn 2 November 1822 Diligente left Rochefort for Brazil, not returning to Brest until 27 December 1826. Around 1825 or so she was off the coast of Chile where she took a privateer that had fired a broadside at her.\n\nIn 1827 Diligente was again decommissioned for refitting. Then in 1828 she was in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nJuly Monarchy\nUnder Commandant Garibou Diligente took part in the expedition to the mouth of the Tagus River where a French squadron fought the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831. The French vessels fought their way past the Portuguese forts guarding the mouth of the river and sailed up to Lisbon. There they forced the Portuguese king Dom Miguel to accede to French demands, among them that he recognize the July Monarchy. The French also seized all the military and commercial vessels they could find as reparations.\n\nThen in 1835–36 Diligente was on the Livorno station. On 30 January 1836, she was driven ashore and severely damaged at Livorno. On 26 October 1840 she left Toulon for Alexandria, Egypt. She visited Smyrna in March 1841.

The name Diligente translates to \"diligent\" in English, reflecting the ship's intended purpose of rapid pursuit and interception. The Diligente was launched in 1801 and promptly commissioned into the French Navy. The ship was 28 meters long, with a displacement of 250 tons. It was armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns and had a complement of around 100 officers and sailors. The Diligente saw action in several skirmishes against British ships during the Napoleonic Wars. In November 1805, it was part of a French flotilla that attempted to break through the British blockade of Brest. The Diligente fought fiercely against the British ship HMS Loire, but was ultimately captured and taken into British service. Under British command, the Diligente was re-armed and served as a sloop in the Royal Navy. It participated in several successful engagements against French ships, including the capture of the heavily armed privateer Le Superbe. In 1811, the Diligente was sold to the Portuguese Navy, where it continued to serve as a sloop for several years. It was eventually decommissioned and scrapped in 1832. The Diligente's service in both the French and British navies highlights the fluidity of naval allegiances during the Napoleonic Wars, as well as the importance of smaller, maneuverable vessels in naval warfare. Despite its relatively short service life, the Diligente played an important role in the conflicts of its time and left a lasting impression on naval history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 23994545}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"NDISwrapper\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "NDISwrapper is a free software driver wrapper that enables the use of Windows XP network device drivers (for devices such as PCI cards, USB modems, and routers) on Linux operating systems. NDISwrapper works by implementing the Windows kernel and NDIS APIs and dynamically linking Windows network drivers to this implementation.  As a result, it only works on systems based on the instruction set architectures supported by Windows, namely IA-32 and x86-64.\n\nNative drivers for some network adapters are not available on Linux as some manufacturers maintain proprietary interfaces and do not write cross-platform drivers. NDISwrapper allows the use of Windows drivers, which are available for virtually all modern PC network adapters.\n\nUse  \nThere are three steps: Creating a Linux driver, installing it, and using it. NDISwrapper is composed of two main parts, a command-line tool used at installation time and a Windows subsystem used when an application calls the Wi-Fi subsystem.\n\nAs the outcome of an NDISwrapper installation should be some sort of Linux driver to be able to work with Linux applications, the first action the user does is to \"compile\" a couple or more of Windows files, and the NDISwrapper's version of Windows DDK into a Linux Kernel Module. This is done with a tool named \"ndiswrapper\". The resultant linux driver is then installed (often manually) in the OS. A Linux application can then send request to this Linux driver that automatically does the needed adaptations to call its—now—internal Windows driver and DDK.\n\nTo achieve this \"compilation\" NDISwrapper requires at least the \".inf\" and the \".sys\" files invariably supplied as parts of the Windows driver.  For example, if the driver is called \"mydriver\", with the files mydriver.inf and mydriver.sys and vendorid:productid 0000:0000, then NDISwrapper installs the driver to /etc/ndiswrapper/mydriver/.  This directory contains three files:\n 0000:0000.conf, which contains information extracted from the inf file\n mydriver.inf (the original inf file)\n mydriver.sys (the driver file)\n\nGraphical frontends \n\nThere are graphical frontends to NDISwrapper, such as Ndisgtk and NdisConfig, which allow NDISwrapper to be installed using a graphical user interface rather than console commands.\n\nArchitecture \nNDISwrapper enables a Unix-like system to use Windows drivers of type NDIS and WIFI.\nIt was useful at a time where there were no Linux Wi-Fi drivers for common Wi-Fi cards.\nIt is composed of:\n An NDIS driver, which is a kind of overlay for Ethernet device drivers.\n A Wi-Fi manager, to control the radio and security part of the Wi-Fi card. It exposes a \"wireless extension\" interface.\n A USB manager and a PnP manager to make it possible to use Wi-Fi card embedded in USB sticks. The USB manager is composed of two parts, first a tiny USBD implementation (USB stack) then a simple Windows Driver Model (WDM) USB driver that is itself composed of two parts: The front part will receive calls from the NDISwrapper USB stack (in fact from calls coming from the original Windows driver that were normally intended to go to the Windows USB stack) and the rear part is using Linux USB stack.\n A minimal Ntoskrnl simulating the DDK for:\n managing calls from the Windows driver.\n managing IRP to the Windows driver (WDM only at the moment)\n managing filter drivers in a simplistic way\n loading/unloading Windows drivers\n A wrapper converting Linux calls to Windows and the other way round, also managing results and error codes\n\nHow it works \nNdiswrapper uses Windows INF files.\n\nWhen a Linux application calls a device which is registered on Linux as an NDISwrapper device, the NDISwrapper determines which Windows driver is targeted. It then converts the Linux query into Windows parlance, it calls the Windows driver, waits for the result and translates it into Linux parlance then sends the result back to the Linux application.\nIt's possible from a Linux driver (NDISwrapper is a Linux driver) to call a Windows driver because they both execute in the same address space (the same as the Linux kernel).\nIf the Windows driver is composed of layered drivers (for example one for Ethernet above one for USB) it's the upper layer driver which is called, and this upper layer will create new calls (IRP in Windows parlance) by calling the \"mini ntoskrnl\". So the \"mini ntoskrnl\" must know there are other drivers, it must have registered them in its internal database a priori by reading the Windows \".inf\" files.\n\nSimilar programs \nDriverLoader is a commercial tool produced by Linuxant for Linux which seems to provide the same functionality as NDISwrapper.\nIndependently of but roughly simultaneously with the NDISwrapper project, Bill Paul of Wind River Systems developed a similar system, known as Project Evil or The NDISulator, for FreeBSD.  It has since been ported to DragonFly BSD and NetBSD.\n\nLimitations \n NDISwrapper relies on the elderly \"wireless-extensions\" to enable applications to access Wi-Fi.\n As NDISwrapper relies on Windows drivers; it only supports i386 and x86_64 architectures.\n NDISwrapper does not implement NDIS 6 (Windows Vista version) yet, limiting drivers to Windows XP. , a code branch at the project site has been under development since 2006, but a feature request from 2009 has been left unassigned.\n\nWhile it is not a major problem for the x86 architecture because of the popularity of Windows XP x86-32, many vendors choose to make 64-bit driver versions only for Windows Vistawhich means that Linux systems using the x86-64 architecture are unable to use such networking devices (they can neither use XP x86-32 NDIS5 because they are 64bits systems nor NDIS6 64bit drivers because they can't use NDIS6). It's still possible to use Windows XP 64 bit drivers which implement NDIS5, however, there are fewer available drivers for xp64 (NDIS5/64 bit) than for XP32 (NDIS5/32 bit).\n\n Since 2006, most Windows drivers are compliant with Windows Driver Foundation (WDF) which NDISWrapper can't use. It renders NDISWrapper obsolete, as it only supports the previous WDM driver framework.\n\nSee also \n\n List of wireless router firmware projects\n cabextract\n DebWRT\n INF file\n LibreWRT\n Linux Unified Kernel\n ReactOS\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n NDISwrapper Wiki\n NDISwrapper Download Area\n NDISwrapper Installation – An easy to follow video showing how to install NDISwrapper and get started with it.\n Ndisgtk\n NdisConfig\n Project Evil: The Evil Continues, 2004-01-24, Bill Paul on a FreeBSD mailing list\n Too Evil, Too Furious, 2005-04-25, Bill Paul on a FreeBSD mailing list\n NetBSD NDIS Driver Port\n\nDevice drivers\nCompatibility layers", "machine_text": "NDISwrapper is an open-source software compatibility layer that enables the use of Windows Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) network device drivers on Linux operating systems. It was created by the Linux community in response to the lack of official Linux drivers for many popular wireless network adapters. NDISwrapper works by using the NDIS API to redirect requests made by Linux kernel mode drivers to the corresponding Windows NDIS drivers. This allows Linux to use these Windows drivers as if they were native Linux drivers, making it easy to install and configure wireless network adapters on Linux systems. NDISwrapper can be used in two modes: the \"wrapper\" mode and the \"bridge\" mode. In the \"wrapper\" mode, NDISwrapper creates a Linux device driver that interacts with the Windows NDIS driver, while in the \"bridge\" mode, NDISwrapper bridges network traffic between a Windows driver and Linux native drivers. NDISwrapper has several advantages, the most significant being its ability to provide support for a large number of wireless network adapters that do not have native Linux drivers. This makes it an ideal solution for Linux users who may be looking for a way to use their Windows-compatible wireless network adapters with their Linux operating system. Additionally, NDISwrapper's compatibility layer is relatively lightweight, making it suitable for use with older or less powerful hardware. In conclusion, NDISwrapper is an invaluable tool for Linux users who need to utilize wireless networks. Its open-source development ensures it will always be up-to-date with the latest technologies and can be accessed by anyone in need. With its low-resource usage and compatibility with a broad range of devices, it remains an excellent option for Linux users to access their preferred wireless networks.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2646593}

Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama teaches Lisa that there is no shame in being an overachiever, and Nelson Muntz teaches a blind boy how to be a schoolyard bully.\n\nThe episode was written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore.\n\nThe episode was also watched by 5.69 million households and received a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode guest stars Sarah Silverman as Nikki and Angela Bassett as Michelle Obama.\n\nPlot\nBart's fourth-grade class is merged with another fourth-grade class when teacher Mrs. Krabappel is absent. In the crowded classroom, Bart is forced to sit by a new student named Nikki. At first, they dislike each other, until Nikki admires Bart's artistic skills. Bart seeks romance advice from Homer, who passes him off to Grandpa Abe. After Grandpa advises Bart to kiss Nikki, however, when Bart does so after the two skateboard together, she recoils in disgust. Nikki's attorney's parents threaten to sue the school unless it is declared an \"affection-free environment\". Superintendent Chalmers causes a play in which Willie plays Nikki and Skinner plays Bart who was strangled by Homer after calling him a “Fatso”, meaning they are forced to kiss. Bart is confused at the outcome of this seemingly innocent action, and his confusion is later amplified when Nikki hides in his locker and kisses him again.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa becomes popular when she receives an F on a test, but becomes unpopular again when it is revealed that her test was mistakenly given to Ralph, as both tests were mixed up as the F grade was supposed to be given to Ralph who had written Lisa's name on his test. Angry about being ostracized for being an overachiever once again, Lisa blogs about it, and her post is noted by a mysterious blogger known as Flotus 1 who turns out to be First Lady Michelle Obama. Obama drops by Springfield Elementary to give a speech about the importance of academics and recommends that the students should be nice to Lisa and other overachievers like her friends, Martin Prince and Allison Taylor.\n\nBart and Nikki have been watching this speech from the roof, and Bart confesses to Nikki he does not understand her ever-changing moods. They argue and Bart stumbles, falling off the roof. Nikki says \"I love you,\" but seeing that Bart is breathing treats him badly again. Bart stops breathing again, but the school's \"no-touch\" policy prevents anyone from performing CPR. Nikki defies the policy and revives Bart via mouth-to-mouth, thus setting off a montage of kiss scenes from various movies, some of which (such as Alien 3) never even had kiss scenes in them. When Bart awakes, Nikki's mood changes yet again and Bart remains in a state of complete confusion over female behavior. He tells her he does not care what happens between her and him, but then changes his mind and yells out \"I love you!\" after she kisses him once again.\n\nThroughout the episode, Nelson Muntz has befriended a blind boy and teaches him how to laugh at the misfortunes of others. In the end, the blind boy tricks Nelson into believing that a punch he sustained after insulting Nelson restored his sight. When he reveals to Nelson that this was a prank and laughs at Nelson's signature \"haw haw\", Nelson is as impressed as he is touched by the achievement.\n\nProduction\nThe episode is written by John Frink and directed by Steven Dean Moore, his second director credit for the season after \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\". The episode features guest star Sarah Silverman as Nikki (Bart's crush) and Angela Bassett as Michelle Obama.\n\nIn September 2016, executive producer James L. Brooks told  Variety that the crew had been \"aggressive\" in trying to get Obama to voice herself, and received a rejection note saying \"good try\".\n\nCultural references\nIn the classroom, Nikki shows Bart a book about vampires which looks like the Twilight series book New Moon, which reads Red Moon. In the scene where Nikki performs CPR on Bart, recreations of kissing scenes from a variety of films and television shows are shown. These scenes are (in order); From Here to Eternity (1953), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Quiet Man (1952), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Planet of the Apes (1968), On Golden Pond (1981), Ghost (1990), Spider-Man (2002), Star Trek (2009), Beauty and the Beast (1987–1990), The Public Enemy (1931), WALL-E (2008), Alien 3 (1992), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and an All in the Family (1971–1979) episode in which Sammy Davis Jr. guest starred. The sequence, and the accompanying musical score, are a nod to Cinema Paradiso (1988), directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, with score by Ennio and Andrea Morricone. The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon is a parody of the 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance, here titled Koyaanis-Scratchy: Death Out of Balance.\n\nReception\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Stealing First Base\" was watched by 5.69 million households getting a 2.8/8 in the 18-49 Nielsen Rating. The episode came in second in its time slot and was the second most-watched show on Fox that night, after a new episode of Family Guy.\n\nEmily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club criticized the episode, giving it a C+, calling the harassment storyline \"pointless and stupid\" although praised the Nelson subplot.\n\nHowever, Jason Hughes of HuffPostTV praised the storyline, writing \"I applaud the series for facing such an issue with such intensity, and handling it with humor and compassion\".\n\nRobert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, saying that \"Nikki turned out to be a fun and memorable character.\" Overall he stated that \"Although ‘Stealing First Base’ fed us some old ideas, it did so with a lot of great bits...and some very strong guest voices.\"\n\nSoundtrack \nThe scene where Bart and Nikki were performing a skateboard parkour contains the song \"Chase\" by Giorgio Moroder on the original FOX broadcast. When the episode is shown in syndication, \"Chase\" is replaced by a musically similar composition.\n\nThe classical music that is heard during the montage of movie kiss scenes is currently believed to be orchestrated specifically for the show, rather than being a score that was written independently and used during the program. Original music is from Cinema Paradiso - \"Love Theme\", composed by Andrea Morricone.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nThe Simpsons (season 21) episodes\n2010 American television episodes", "machine_text": "Stealing first base is a term used in baseball that describes the act of a batter taking off towards first base after a pitch that is not caught by the catcher. Though it is not an official statistic, this maneuver is a daring and often successful strategy that can help a team get a win in a close game. The idea behind stealing first base is to catch the opposing team off guard and take advantage of their mistakes. The move is usually attempted with two strikes on the batter, as the catcher is likely to be more focused on the possibility of a strikeout than on keeping the ball from escaping. Once the pitch is made and the ball is not caught cleanly, the batter sprints towards first base as fast as possible. If the catcher is unable to retrieve the ball and throw it to first base before the batter arrives, the batter is safe and has successfully stolen first base. While this strategy may seem risky, it can be very effective in certain situations. For instance, if a team is down by one or two runs late in the game, stealing first base can provide an opportunity to tie or win the game. Additionally, if a team has a fast runner on base, stealing first can put two runners in scoring position, increasing the chance of scoring runs. Although it is not a common strategy, stealing first base has been used with success in professional baseball games. Notable examples include Astros outfielder Derek Fisher's steal of first base in 2018, and Yankees infielder Tyler Wade's similar maneuver in 2021. In conclusion, stealing first base is a bold and risky move that can sometimes pay off big for a team. While it may not be a common strategy, it has been used to great effect in high-pressure moments, making it a tactic worth considering for any team in need of a win.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25986662}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Apologeticus\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Apologeticus ( or Apologeticus) is a text attributed to Tertullian, consisting of apologetic and polemic. In this work Tertullian defends Christianity, demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated as all other sects of the Roman Empire. It is in this treatise that one finds the sentence \"Plures efficimur, quotiens metimur a vobis: semen est sanguis Christianorum.\" which has been liberally and apocryphally translated as \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church\" (Apologeticus, L.13). Alexander Souter translated this phrase as \"We spring up in greater numbers the more we are mown down by you: the blood of the Christians is the seed of a new life,\" but even this takes liberties with the original text. \"We multiply when you reap us. The blood of Christians is seed,\" is perhaps a more faithful, if less poetic, rendering. \n\nThere is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian's Ad nationes—published earlier in the same year—and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of Apologeticus. There arises also the question of similarity to Minucius Felix's dialogue Octavius. Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.\n\nTertullian's brief De testimonio animae (\"Concerning the Evidences of the Soul\") is an appendix to the Apologeticus, intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase testimonium animae naturaliter christianae in chapter  17).\n\nAuthorship\nNot much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a presbyter (priest) of the Christian Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. \"No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage… It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage,\" Wright argues, \"that Tertullian most securely belongs\". Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Catholic Church in favor of the Montanist movement, which he remained a part of for at least 10–15 years of his active life and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.\n\nAscribed date\nApologeticus, his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of AD 197, during the reign of :Septimius Severus. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian's conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195. It was written before the edict of Septimius Severus (AD 202), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.\n\nOldest extant manuscripts\n\"The present treatise depends on three authorities, none of them comprising the entire work. The first printed edition, by Martin Mesnart at Paris in 1545, containing chapters 1-19, was made from a manuscript now lost, but which seems to have been a copy of the already mutilated original of the eleventh-century codex Agobardinus (now at Paris). This, our oldest extant authority, contains a number of Tertullian's works, and of the present treatise chapters 1-30; in the first sentence of chapter 21 the copyist, following his original, which had lost a number of pages, passed on (without apparently noticing any discrepancy) to the middle of a sentence near the beginning of a different work On The Dress of Women.\"\n\n\"The study of the manuscripts of Tert. has established that in the Middle Ages several collection of works of this author were in existence1:\n1. The collection of the Codex Agobardinus, the oldest extant manuscript of Tert.2.\n2. The collection of the manuscript of Troyes 523 (Codex Trecensis) of the twelfth century3.\n3. A collection represented by a number of manuscripts, which derive from a lost Codex Cluniacensis and a likewise lost manuscript from Hirsau (Württemberg), the Hirsaugiensis4.\n\nAddressees and audience\nThis work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- \"that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters\"— and thus bears resemblance to the Greek apologues. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads \"for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens\". Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian's defense against rationalizations and rumours and who  \"would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian’s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion\".\n\nGenre\nApologeticus has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting \"from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical\". Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian's modern editor :Otto Bardenhewer further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, \"a model of judicial discussion\". Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.\n\nSummary of Apologeticus\nThe following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider's translation of Apologeticus.\n\nIntroduction and addressing of unjust treatment of the Christians (Chapters 1–6)\nThe first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not. To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name \"Christian\". Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.\n\nIn addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions :Nero, and to a certain extent :Domitian, as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning \"some magnificent good\". He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that \"restrained extravagance and bribery\", \"protected their [women's] modesty and sobriety\", of the \"conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce\". These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the \"crimes\" committed by the Christians.\n\nCharges based on rumor answered (Chapters 7–9)\nTertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It's all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. \n\nOf the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.\n\nCharges of more \"manifest crimes\" answered (Chapters 10–45)\n\nOf the more \"manifest crimes\", as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring \"for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues' images.\" In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argues, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. \n\nChristians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out \"God\" despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses, who was 1000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Roman literature tradition, to many others key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became \"so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world\". Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, \"his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to ‘united’) with God\". Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason.  \n\nTo the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; \"We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays\". Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God's hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.\n\nTertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.\n\nPortrait of Christian society and of philosophy (Chapters 39–47)\nTertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they \"bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us\". Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, \"in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul\". He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, \"it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity\". He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.\n\nConcluding considerations and remarks\nTertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says \"Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God\".\n\nSee also\n Religio licita, a phrase found only in the Apologeticus to describe the special status of Judaism under Roman rule\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \nWright, David & Philip F.

This type of writing originated in ancient Greece and Rome, but it has continued to be used throughout history to defend various causes or beliefs in both religious and secular contexts. One of the most famous Apologeticus works in history is the \"Apology\" by Plato, which presents a defense of Socrates' philosophy and conduct in the face of accusations of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens. Similarly, the early Christian church produced a number of Apologeticus texts in response to accusations of heresy and persecution by the Roman Empire. In the modern era, Apologeticus literature has continued to be used by various groups and individuals to defend their beliefs and actions. For example, modern apologists often present a defense of Christianity and its teachings, particularly in response to criticism from atheists and secularists. Apologeticus writing can take many forms, including essays, speeches, and books. Some notable examples from history include St. Augustine's \"City of God,\" which defends Christianity against accusations of causing the fall of Rome, and Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa Theologica,\" which provides a systematic defense of Catholic theology. One of the key features of Apologeticus writing is the use of logic and rhetoric to make a persuasive case for a particular belief or action. Apologists employ a variety of techniques, including historical evidence, philosophical argumentation, and personal testimony, to make their case. In conclusion, Apologeticus literature has a long and rich history, spanning cultures and beliefs.

The fictional deity is part of H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, a collection of stories and works that focus on the existence of ancient, otherworldly beings who threaten to destroy humanity. Cthulhu, a fusion of octopus, dragon and humanoid derived from the Lovecraft Mythos, is portrayed as a monstrous entity that lies in wait, sleeping under the surface of the sea. According to the myths, when the time comes and the stars are right, it will wake up from its long sleep, and humanity will be doomed. Cthulhu was first introduced in the short story \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" published in 1928. Lovecraft described the creature as \"a mountainous thing with octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, line on line of tentacle-like it had, and within these writhed a thousand small tendrils like fingers.\" Cthulhu's rise has become the subject of popular culture, with a plethora of books, movies, TV shows, and video games built around the creature's mythos. The post-apocalyptic setting of the Lovecraft Mythos, where Cthulhu and other powerful beings wreak havoc upon humanity, is particularly popular among horror lovers and enthusiasts. In conclusion, the term Cthulhu Rise has come to represent the mythical creature's supposed awakening from its sleep, signaling the end of humanity as we know it. The idea has inspired various works of fiction and popular culture, making Cthulhu an enduring icon of horror.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 40058225}

The movement was founded by a group of scholars and thinkers who were dismayed by what they saw as the nihilistic tendencies of postmodernism and the erosion of traditional values and cultural norms. Trystavisim is characterized by its emphasis on the importance of objective truth and the search for universal ethical principles. Unlike postmodernism, which rejects the notion of objective truth and argues that meaning is subjective and contingent on social and historical contexts, Trystavisim holds that there are certain values and principles that are universally valid and applicable to all human societies. One of the central tenets of Trystavisim is the idea of moral realism, which holds that moral truths are objective and exist independently of human beliefs and desires. This view is in contrast to moral relativism, which argues that moral judgments are relative to individual or cultural perspectives. Trystavisim also emphasizes the importance of reason and rationality in ethical decision making. It holds that moral judgments should be based on logical and evidence-based arguments, rather than being swayed by emotions or personal biases. The movement has influenced a range of disciplines, including philosophy, politics, and jurisprudence. It has been particularly influential in the fields of bioethics and environmental ethics, where it has helped to shape debates around issues such as animal rights, genetic engineering, and climate change. Critics of Trystavisim have argued that its insistence on objective truth is overly simplistic and fails to appreciate the complexity and diversity of human experience. They also question its tendency towards moral absolutism, arguing that such views can lead to intolerance and dogmatism. Despite these criticisms, Trystavisim continues to be an important and influential philosophical movement, shaping debates around some of the most pressing ethical issues of our time.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42831309}

Lashi is spoken in several parts of Myanmar, including Shan State and Kachin State, as well as in some parts of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The exact number of Lashi speakers is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 50,000. Lashi has several dialects, each with distinct vocabulary and pronunciation. The main dialects are the Northern, Central, and Southern. The Northern dialect is spoken in Lashi villages near the Chinese border, while the Central and Southern dialects are spoken in Shan State. The Lashi language has its own unique script, which is based on the Burmese script. However, it is rarely used, and most Lashi speakers use the Burmese script instead. The Lashi language has been slowly disappearing due to the influence of other dominant languages in the region, such as Burmese and Chinese. The Lashi people have also experienced discrimination and repression from the Myanmar government, which has made it difficult for them to preserve their culture and language. Efforts are being made by some Lashi speakers to preserve their language and culture through education, cultural events, and language documentation. The Lashi language is taught in some schools in Shan State, and there are a few Lashi-language newspapers and books available.

The validity of these specimens was doubted and many believed they were intentionally produced hybrids, a common technique in China to produce turtles that get high prices.\n\nIn 2007, He et al. sampled the three living specimens and gave the genetic proof that all three living specimens are indeed C. yunnanensis and not hybrids. In 2008, Kadoorie Conservation China, a department of Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, together with the Kunming Institute of Zoology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered a small wild population.

The turtle was first described by Ernest Stejneger in 1929 and was later reclassified to its current scientific name in 1994. The Yunnan box turtle is a small turtle that typically measures between 10 and 15 centimeters in length. It has a distinctive appearance, with a brownish-black shell that is covered in yellow radiating lines. The turtle's head and legs are also black, while its neck and underside are yellowish-brown. The Yunnan box turtle is classified as a vulnerable species, primarily due to habitat loss and over-collection for the pet trade. The Yunnan box turtle is a semi-aquatic species that is found in freshwater habitats such as streams, ponds, and marshes. It is largely herbivorous, feeding on aquatic vegetation, insects and small invertebrates. The turtle is known to be shy and relatively docile in nature, which has made it a popular target for the illegal pet trade. Efforts have been made to protect the Yunnan box turtle in recent years. One such project is the Yunnan box turtle conservation program, which is a joint effort between the Chinese and US governments to study and conserve this species. The program focuses on researching the turtle's behavior and habitat, as well as educating local communities about the importance of protecting the species. In addition to conservation efforts, there are also regulations in place to prevent the illegal trade of this species. The Yunnan box turtle is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts its international trade. Overall, the Yunnan box turtle is an important species that plays a vital role in its ecosystem.

It was primarily an agriculture community, with many farms and plantations growing cotton, corn, and tobacco. Later on, the city also became known for its timber industry. Today, Macclenny is a charming small town with a mix of local businesses, restaurants, and historic landmarks. One of the most notable landmarks is the Baker County Courthouse, which was built in 1908 and is one of the oldest functioning courthouses in the state. The city hosts a few annual events, such as the Baker County Fair and the Easter in the Park event at Memorial Park. The Memorial Park is one of the green spots in the area and has walking trails &, picnic pavilions, and playgrounds.

He was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) in the fourth round (127th overall) in the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Brigham Young University Cougars. Collie also played in the NFL for the New England Patriots and in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the BC Lions.\n\nEarly life\nCollie was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to American parents Scott and Nicole Collie. Scott Collie played football at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1979 to 1982 and played professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and briefly in the NFL for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1983 pre-season. His older brother, Zac Collie, also played receiver for the BYU Cougars from 2003 to 2006. Austin served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was recruited by Stanford, Arizona, Arizona State, Washington State, Oregon State, Colorado, Utah, and UNLV, before choosing BYU.\n\nCollie starred as a wide receiver at Oak Ridge High School and garnered many awards. He was a PrepStar and SuperPrep All-American as well as being voted Northern California's Most Valuable Player. During his senior season, he recorded 60 receptions for a total of 978 yards and 18 touchdowns. In 2004, Collie became an Eagle Scout.\n\nIn December 2009, Collie's hometown newspaper, The Sacramento Bee, named him Sacramento Area's Player of the Decade (2000–2009).\n\nCollege career\nIn 2004, Collie was named MWC Freshman of the Year. He was also named the MVP of the 2007 Las Vegas Bowl and named to the All-MWC first team in 2008.\n\nCollie set a series of records during his three-year career at BYU (2004, 2007–2008).\n\nAdditionally, Collie was also one of the highest rated wide receivers in College Football during his junior season in which he was selected to the college football All–American team.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, Collie announced in a press conference that he would forgo his senior year and enter the 2009 NFL Draft. The Indianapolis Colts drafted him in the fourth round, 127th overall.\n\nProfessional career\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nCollie impressed Indianapolis Colts Head Coach Jim Caldwell in the preseason and was placed third on the depth chart at the wide receiver position for the 2009 season, placing ahead of Pierre Garçon for the slot receiver position. However, Garçon soon jumped Collie on the depth chart shortly thereafter. Collie finished his rookie season in the NFL among the top statistical leaders for all rookies at the wide receiver position.\n\nCollie started his second year strong, making numerous touchdown catches and establishing himself as Peyton Manning's \"go-to guy\" after Dallas Clark suffered a season-ending injury. However, on November 7, 2010, Collie was involved in a collision against the Philadelphia Eagles, in which he was hit on both sides of his head by Quintin Mikell and Kurt Coleman. Collie was taken off the field on a stretcher. According to a televised ESPN update, Collie was seen sitting up and moving after several minutes working with medics. Collie suffered a concussion as a result of the collision. Coleman was penalized for unnecessary roughness for the hit on Collie, but neither player was fined, as the NFL later ruled that the contact that caused the injury was incidental as a result of Mikell's initial hit. On December 19, 2010, Collie was hit in the head by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith and was down for several minutes. It was his second concussion-related injury that year and ultimately ended his 2010 season. Despite the fact that no fines were assessed, the highly visible injuries to Collie have added to the debate about violent hits in football. On December 22, 2010, Collie was placed on injured reserve.\n\nCollie played in all 16 games, making 5 starts, during the 2011 regular season, but managed to only catch one touchdown pass among his 54 receptions.\n\nDuring a 2012 preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Collie suffered his third concussion of his career. During the third game of the 2012 season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Collie suffered a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee, causing him to miss the rest of the 2012 season.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, Collie was told he would not be re-signed by the Colts.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nOn August 2, 2013, the San Francisco 49ers signed Collie to a 1-year contract. He was released on August 31, 2013, during final roster cuts.\n\nNew England Patriots\nThe New England Patriots signed Collie as a free agent on October 3, 2013. He was signed for a one-year, veteran-minimum contract, which is $715,000 but prorated to $546,765. Due to Collie's previous injuries, the contract included an injury waiver, meaning the Patriots could release him if he was injured and only owe him a \"split\" (50%) of the contract. He was released November 5, 2013 because of a knee injury, after only 3 catches for 34 yards. He was re-signed by the Patriots on December 5, 2013 to add depth with rookie wideouts Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins dealing with nagging injuries. He was released once more on December 27, 2013, only to be re-signed on January 2, 2014. The Patriots released Collie again after the playoffs.\n\nBC Lions\nOn January 29, 2015, the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League announced they had signed Collie to a contract. In his only CFL season, Collie played in 16 games, catching 43 passes for 439 yards with 7 touchdowns. Collie also recorded a touchdown as a passer, throwing a 21-yard score to quarterback Jonathon Jennings on a trick play. \n\nOn April 8, 2016, Collie announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nCareer NFL statistics\n\nSee also\n List of NCAA major college football yearly receiving leaders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n BC Lions bio\n NFL bio\n New England Patriots bio \n Indianapolis Colts bio \n BYU bio\n\n1985 births\nLiving people\nPeople from El Dorado Hills, California\nLatter Day Saints from California\nSportspeople from Hamilton, Ontario\nPlayers of Canadian football from Ontario\nAmerican football wide receivers\nBYU Cougars football players\nIndianapolis Colts players\nSan Francisco 49ers players\nNew England Patriots players\nAmerican players of Canadian football\nCanadian football wide receivers\nBC Lions players\nAmerican Mormon missionaries in Argentina\nCanadian players of American football", "machine_text": "Austin Collie is a former American football wide receiver who played for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

Moira's son, RJ Stern, is a college football player who was featured on season 5 of Last Chance U on Netflix.\n\nIn 1965, Bradley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. Afterward, she moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, with her brother Paul Edwin Zimmer, she helped found and name the Society for Creative Anachronism and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to Staten Island.\n\nBradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married, and continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on child molestation charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years. She had edited Breen's book Greek Love (published pseudonymously), which was dedicated to her (named simply as \"his wife\"), and in 1965 had contributed an article, \"Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature\", to Breen's journal The International Journal of Greek Love. She had known about Breen's sexual interests and previously accepted his sexual abuse of a 14-year-old boy.\n\nReligion\nWhile she was attending the College for Teachers (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, Bradley became involved in Western esoteric tradition. She later completed the Rosicrucian correspondence course.\n\nIn the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and Walter H. Breen founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of Dion Fortune. By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.\n\nBradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups. In 1981 Bradley, Diana L. Paxson, and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.\n\nIn the 1990s Bradley said she would return to Christianity, telling an interviewer: \"I just go regularly to the Episcopalian church ... That pagan thing ... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities.\"\n\nDeath\nAfter suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, England.\n\nChild sex abuse allegations\nIn 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of 3 to 12. In an email to The Guardian, Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because:\n\nGreyland also reported that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. Greyland is currently outspoken about her beliefs that her parents’ homosexuality was the cause of their pedophilic tendencies. According to Greyland, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.\n\nAdditionally, according to Greyland, Bradley assisted Breen (her husband at the time) in accessing and abusing multiple unrelated young boys, knowing he was a pedophile who was engaging in sexual contact with children as young as eight. Greyland states that Bradley and her live-in female partner (whom Greyland refers to as her step-mother) both admitted to knowledge of the abuse and purposefully avoided investigating, questioning, or notifying any authorities. Bradley was also accused of attempting to adopt a child whom Breen was interested in sexually.\n\nIn response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, began donating all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. Janni Lee Simner donated advances and royalties from her two Darkover short stories and, at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\n\nAfter the allegations were made public, Greyland spoke at length about her experiences growing up and became active in speaking out against homosexual relationships and her beliefs in their negative affects on the nuclear family. A number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \"horrific\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote that Bradley's positive effect on her readers and associates \"makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\" G Willow Wilson, who along with Bradley is a fellow World Fantasy Award winner, said she was \"speechless\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother.\"\n\nLiterary career\nBradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, C.L. Moore, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about \"the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be\". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel The Forest House, her retelling of Norma; she finished it before her death.\n\nBradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in Amazing Stories in 1949 with the short story \"Outpost\". \"Outpost\" was published in Amazing Stories Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine Spacewarp Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948.  Her first professional publication was a short story \"Women Only\", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of Vortex Science Fiction in 1953. Her first published novel-length work was Falcons of Narabedla, first published in the May 1957 issue of Other Worlds.\n\nEarly in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels; I Am a Lesbian was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered pornographic when published.\n\nHer 1958 novel The Planet Savers introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a science fantasy fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.\nBradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned Amazing Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including Astra's Tower, Day*Star, and Anything Box. She also co-edited fanzines, including Ugly Bird with Redd Boggs, MEZRAB with her first husband Robert Bradley, and Allerlei with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including The Gorgon and The Nekromantikon. In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, she wrote two short fanfic stories about Arwen and published them in chapbook format. One story, \"The Jewel of Arwen\" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine I Palantir #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.\n\nIn 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the Society for Creative Anachronism and is credited with coining the name of that group.\n\nFor many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.\n\nBradley was the editor of the long-running Sword and Sorceress anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies.  Mercedes Lackey was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley, California. Bradley was editing the final Sword and Sorceress manuscript until the week of her death.\n\nHer most famous single novel may be The Mists of Avalon, a retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.\n\nBradley was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.\n\nBibliography\n\nNovels\n Falcons of Narabedla (1957)\n The Door Through Space (1961)\n Seven from the Stars (1961)\n The Colors of Space (1963)\n Castle Terror (1965)\n Souvenir of Monique (1967)\n Bluebeard's Daughter (1968)\n The Brass Dragon (1970)\n In the Steps of the Master – The Sixth Sense #2 (1973) (based on the television series The Sixth Sense, created by Anthony Lawrence)\n Hunters of the Red Moon (1973) (novelette)\n The Jewel of Arwen (1974) (novelette)\n The Parting of Arwen (1974) (novelette)\n Can Ellen Be Saved?

Her first published novel was \"The Door Through Space,\" which came out in 1961. She became better known for her later works, including the Darkover series, which explored a planet inhabited by humans with telepathic abilities. The series consisted of over 20 novels and short stories. Bradley was also known for her feminist activism. In the 1960s, she was involved with the Society for Creative Anachronism, a group devoted to reenacting the Middle Ages. She helped to establish women's roles in the organization and wrote several articles on the subject. Bradley co-founded the Center for Nonviolent Social Change with her husband, Walter Breen, in the 1970s. The organization focused on civil rights and anti-war efforts. However, Bradley's legacy has been tarnished by accusations that she sexually abused several children. In 2014, her daughter Moira Greyland published a memoir alleging that she and her brother were victims of abuse by both Bradley and Breen. Several other individuals have also come forward with similar claims. Despite the controversy, Bradley's work remains influential in the science fiction and fantasy genres.

They were further studied in the classical paper of Alan Weinstein, where many basic structure theorems were first proved, and which exerted a huge influence on the development of Poisson geometry — which today is deeply entangled with non-commutative geometry, integrable systems, topological field theories and representation theory, to name a few.\n\nPoisson structures are named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.\n\nDefinition\nThere are two main points of view to define Poisson structures: it is customary and convenient to switch between them, and we shall do so below.\n\nAs bracket \nLet  be a smooth manifold and let  denote the real algebra of smooth real-valued functions on , where the multiplication is defined pointwise. A Poisson bracket (or Poisson structure) on  is an -bilinear map\n\ndefining a structure of Poisson algebra on , i.e. satisfying the following three conditions:\n Skew symmetry: .\n Jacobi identity: .\n Leibniz's Rule: .\n\nThe first two conditions ensure that  defines a Lie-algebra structure on , while the third guarantees that, for each , the linear map  is a derivation of the algebra , i.e., it defines a vector field  called the Hamiltonian vector field associated to .  \n\nChoosing some local coordinates , any Poisson bracket is given byfor  the Poisson bracket of the coordinate functions.\n\nAs bivector \nA Poisson bivector on a smooth manifold  is a bivector field  satisfying the non-linear partial differential equation , where \n\ndenotes the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket on multivector fields. Choosing some local coordinates , any Poisson bivector is given byfor  skew-symmetric smooth functions on .\n\nEquivalence of the definitions \nLet  be a bilinear skew-symmetric bracket satisfying Leibniz's rule; then the function  can be described as \n\n,\n\nfor a unique smooth bivector field . Conversely, given any smooth bivector field  on , the same formula  defines a bilinear skew-symmetric bracket  that automatically obeys Leibniz's rule.\n\nLast, the following conditions are equivalent\n\n  satisfies the Jacobi identity (hence it is a Poisson bracket)\n  satisfies  (hence it a Poisson bivector)\n the map  is a Lie algebra homomorphism, i.e. the Hamiltonian vector fields satisfy \n the graph  defines a Dirac structure, i.e. a Lagrangian subbundle  which is closed under the standard Courant bracket.\n\nSymplectic leaves\n\nA Poisson manifold is naturally partitioned into regularly immersed symplectic manifolds of possibly different dimensions, called its symplectic leaves. These arise as the maximal integral submanifolds of the completely integrable singular foliation spanned by the Hamiltonian vector fields.\n\nRank of a Poisson structure \nRecall that any bivector field can be regarded as a skew homomorphism . The image  consists therefore of the values  of all Hamiltonian vector fields evaluated at every . \n\nThe rank of  at a point  is the rank of the induced linear mapping . A point  is called regular for a Poisson structure  on  if and only if the rank of  is constant on an open neighborhood of ; otherwise, it is called a singular point. Regular points form an open dense subspace ; when , i.e. the map  is of constant rank, the Poisson structure  is called regular. Examples of regular Poisson structures include trivial and nondegenerate structures (see below).\n\nThe regular case \nFor a regular Poisson manifold, the image  is a regular distribution; it is easy to check that it is involutive, therefore, by Frobenius theorem,  admits a partition into leaves. Moreover, the Poisson bivector restricts nicely to each leaf, which become therefore symplectic manifolds.\n\nThe non-regular case \nFor a non-regular Poisson manifold the situation is more complicated, since the distribution  is singular, i.e. the vector subspaces  have different dimensions.\n\nAn integral submanifold for  is a path-connected submanifold  satisfying  for all . Integral submanifolds of  are automatically regularly immersed manifolds, and maximal integral submanifolds of  are called the leaves of .\n\nMoreover, each leaf  carries a natural symplectic form  determined by the condition  for all  and . Correspondingly, one speaks of the symplectic leaves of . Moreover, both the space  of regular points and its complement are saturated by symplectic leaves, so symplectic leaves may be either regular or singular.\n\nWeinstein splitting theorem \nTo show the existence of symplectic leaves also in the non-regular case, one can use Weinstein splitting theorem (or Darboux-Weinstein theorem). It states that any Poisson manifold  splits locally around a point  as the product of a symplectic manifold  and a transverse Poisson submanifold  vanishing at . More precisely, if , there are local coordinates  such that the Poisson bivector  splits as the sumwhere . Note that, when the rank of  is maximal (e.g. the Poisson structure is nondegenerate), one recovers the classical Darboux theorem for symplectic structures.\n\nExamples\n\nTrivial Poisson structures \nEvery manifold  carries the trivial Poisson structure , equivalently described by the bivector . Every point of  is therefore a zero-dimensional symplectic leaf.\n\nNondegenerate Poisson structures \nA bivector field  is called nondegenerate if  is a vector bundle isomorphism. Nondegenerate Poisson bivector fields are actually the same thing as symplectic manifolds .\n\nIndeed, there is a bijective correspondence between nondegenerate bivector fields  and nondegenerate 2-forms , given bywhere  is encoded by . Furthermore,  is Poisson precisely if and only if  is closed; in such case, the bracket becomes the canonical Poisson bracket from Hamiltonian mechanics:Non-degenerate Poisson structures have only one symplectic leaf, namely  itself, and their Poisson algebra  become a Poisson ring.\n\nLinear Poisson structures \nA Poisson structure  on a vector space  is called linear when the bracket of two linear functions is still linear. The class of vector spaces with linear Poisson structures coincides actually with that of (dual of) Lie algebras.\n\nIndeed, the dual  of any finite-dimensional Lie algebra  carries a linear Poisson bracket, known in the literature under the names of Lie-Poisson, Kirillov-Poisson or KKS (Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau) structure:\n\n,\n\nwhere  and the derivatives  are interpreted as elements of the bidual . Equivalently, the Poisson bivector can be locally expressed aswhere  are coordinates on  and  are the associated structure constants of , \n\nConversely, any linear Poisson structure  on  must be of this form, i.e. there exists a natural Lie algebra structure induced on  whose Lie-Poisson bracket recovers .\n\nThe symplectic leaves of the Lie-Poisson structure on  are the orbits of the coadjoint action of  on .\n\nOther examples and constructions \n\n Any constant bivector field on a vector space is automatically a Poisson structure; indeed, all three terms in the Jacobiator are zero, being the bracket with a constant function.\nAny bivector field on a 2-dimensional manifold is automatically a Poisson structure; indeed,  is a 3-vector field, which is always zero in dimension 2.\nThe Cartesian product  of two Poisson manifolds  and  is again a Poisson manifold.\nLet  be a (regular) foliation of dimension  on  and  a closed foliation two-form for which the power  is nowhere-vanishing. This uniquely determines a regular Poisson structure on  by requiring that the symplectic leaves of  be the leaves  of  equipped with the induced symplectic form .\nLet  be a Lie group acting on a Poisson manifold  by Poisson diffeomorphisms. If the action is free and proper, the quotient manifold  inherits a Poisson structure  from  (namely, it is the only one such that the submersion  is a Poisson map).\n\nPoisson cohomology \nThe Poisson cohomology groups  of a Poisson manifold are the cohomology groups of the cochain complex\n\nwhere  is the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket with . Note that such a sequence can be defined for every bivector on ; the condition  is equivalent to , i.e.  being Poisson.\n\nUsing the morphism , one obtains a morphism from the de Rham complex  to the Poisson complex , inducing a group homomorphism . In the nondegenerate case, this becomes an isomorphism, so that the Poisson cohomology of a symplectic manifold fully recovers its de Rham cohomology. \n\nPoisson cohomology is difficult to compute in general, but the low degree groups contain important geometric information on the Poisson structure:  \n\n  is the space of the Casimir functions, i.e. smooth functions Poisson-commuting with all others (or, equivalently, smooth functions constant on the symplectic leaves)\n is the space of Poisson vector fields modulo hamiltonian vector fields\n  is the space of the infinitesimal deformations of the Poisson structure modulo trivial deformations\n  is the space of the obstructions to extend infinitesimal deformations to actual deformations.\n\nPoisson maps\nA smooth mapping  between Poisson manifolds is called a  if it respects the Poisson structures, i.e. one of the following equivalent conditions holds (see the various definitions of Poisson structures above):\n\n the Poisson brackets  and  satisfy  for every  and smooth functions  \n the bivector fields  and  are -related, i.e. \n\n the Hamiltonian vector fields associated to every smooth function  are -related, i.e. \n the differential  is a Dirac morphism.\n\nAn anti-Poisson map satisfies analogous conditions with a minus sign on one side. \n\nPoisson manifolds are the objects of a category , with Poisson maps as morphisms. If a Poisson map  is also a diffeomorphism, then we call  a Poisson-diffeomorphism.\n\nExamples \n Given the product Poisson manifold , the canonical projections , for , are Poisson maps.\n The inclusion mapping of a symplectic leaf, or of an open subspace, is a Poisson map.\nGiven two Lie algebras  and , the dual of any Lie algebra homomorphism  induces a Poisson map  between the linear Poisson structures.\n\nOne should note that the notion of a Poisson map is fundamentally different from that of a symplectic map. For instance, with their standard symplectic structures, there exist no Poisson maps , whereas symplectic maps abound.\n\nSymplectic realisations \nA symplectic realisation on a Poisson manifold M consists of a symplectic manifold  together with a Poisson map  which is a surjective submersion. Roughly speaking, the role of a symplectic realisation is to \"desingularise\" a complicated (degenerate) Poisson manifold by passing to a bigger, but easier (non-degenerate), one. \n\nNote that some authors define symplectic realisations without this last condition (so that, for instance, the inclusion of a symplectic leaf in a symplectic manifold is an example) and call full a symplectic realisation where  is a surjective submersion. Examples of (full) symplectic realisations include the following:\n\n For the trivial Poisson structure , one takes the cotangent bundle , with its canonical symplectic structure, and the projection .\n For a non-degenerate Poisson structure  one takes  itself and the identity .\n\n For the Lie-Poisson structure on , one takes the cotangent bundle  of a Lie group  integrating  and the dual map  of the differential at the identity of the (left or right) translation .\nA symplectic realisation  is called complete if, for any complete Hamiltonian vector field , the vector field  is complete as well. While symplectic realisations always exist for every Poisson manifold (several different proofs are available), complete ones play a fundamental role in the integrability problem for Poisson manifolds (see below).\n\nIntegration of Poisson manifolds \nAny Poisson manifold  induces a structure of Lie algebroid on its cotangent bundle . The anchor map is given by  while the Lie bracket on  is defined asSeveral notions defined for Poisson manifolds can be interpreted via its Lie algebroid :\n\n the symplectic foliation is the usual (singular) foliation induced by the anchor of the Lie algebroid\nthe symplectic leaves are the orbits of the Lie algebroid\n a Poisson structure on  is regular precisely when the associated Lie algebroid  is\n the Poisson cohomology groups coincide with the Lie algebroid cohomology groups of  with coefficients in the trivial representation.\n\nIt is of crucial importance to notice that the Lie algebroid  is not always integrable to a Lie groupoid.\n\nSymplectic groupoids \nA  is a Lie groupoid  together with a symplectic form  which is also multiplicative (i.e. compatible with the groupoid structure). Equivalently, the graph of  is asked to be a Lagrangian submanifold of .\n\nA fundamental theorem states that the base space of any symplectic groupoid admits a unique Poisson structure  such that the source map  and the target map  are, respectively, a Poisson map and an anti-Poisson map. Moreover, the Lie algebroid  is isomorphic to the cotangent algebroid  associated to the Poisson manifold . Conversely, if the cotangent bundle  of a Poisson manifold is integrable to some Lie groupoid , then  is automatically a symplectic groupoid.\n\nAccordingly, the integrability problem for a Poisson manifold consists in finding a symplectic groupoid which integrates its cotangent algebroid; when this happens, we say that the Poisson structure is integrable.\n\nWhile any Poisson manifold admits a local integration (i.e. a symplectic groupoid where the multiplication is defined only locally), there are general topological obstructions to its integrability, coming from the integrability theory for Lie algebroids. Using such obstructions, one can show that a Poisson manifold is integrable if and only if it admits a complete symplectic realisation.\n\nSubmanifolds \nA Poisson submanifold of  is an immersed submanifold  such that the immersion map  is a Poisson map. Equivalently, one asks that every Hamiltonian vector field , for , is tangent to .\n\nThis definition is very natural and satisfies several good properties, e.g. the transverse intersection of two Poisson submanifolds is again a Poisson submanifold. However, it has also a few problems:\n\n Poisson submanifolds are rare: for instance, the only Poisson submanifolds of a symplectic manifold are the open sets;\n the definition does not behave functorially: if  is a Poisson map transverse to a Poisson submanifold  of , the submanifold  of  is not necessarily Poisson.\n\nIn order to overcome these problems, one often uses the notion of a Poisson transversal (originally called cosymplectic submanifold). This can be defined as a submanifold  which is transverse to every symplectic leaf  and such that the intersection  is a symplectic submanifold of . It follows that any Poisson transversal  inherits a canonical Poisson structure  from . In the case of a nondegenerate Poisson manifold  (whose only symplectic leaf is  itself), Poisson transversals are the same thing as symplectic submanifolds.\n\nMore general classes of submanifolds play an important role in Poisson geometry, including Lie-Dirac submanifolds, Poisson-Dirac submanifolds, coisotropic submanifolds and pre-Poisson submanifolds.\n\nSee also\n Nambu-Poisson manifold\n Poisson–Lie group\n Poisson supermanifold\nKontsevich quantization formula\n\nReferences\n\nBooks and surveys\n\n Previous version available on .\n\n See also the review by Ping Xu in the Bulletin of the AMS.\n\nDifferential geometry\nSymplectic geometry\nSmooth manifolds\nStructures on manifolds", "machine_text": "A Poisson manifold is a mathematical object that combines properties of both a manifold and a Poisson algebra. More precisely, it is a smooth manifold equipped with a bivector field that satisfies certain compatibility conditions. This allows the manifold to carry a natural notion of a Poisson bracket, which generalizes the familiar notion of a commutator in linear algebra. Poisson manifolds find applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, including symplectic geometry, integrable systems, and classical mechanics. The concept of a Poisson manifold was first introduced by the French mathematician Siméon-Denis Poisson in his work on celestial mechanics in the early 19th century. However, it was not until the 1960s that the subject began to receive widespread attention from mathematicians, particularly in the context of symplectic geometry. In this context, a symplectic manifold is a Poisson manifold where the bivector field is non-degenerate, meaning that its rank is twice that of the manifold. This guarantees the existence of a non-degenerate two-form on the manifold, which encodes much of the geometric structure. Poisson manifolds also arise naturally in the theory of integrable systems, which studies certain dynamical systems that admit many conserved quantities. It turns out that these conserved quantities can be associated with functions on the phase space of the system that satisfy certain Poisson bracket relations with respect to the Hamiltonian flow. In this way, the Poisson algebra of functions on a Poisson manifold provides a natural framework for studying integrable systems. In recent years, Poisson manifolds have also found applications in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of classical and quantum field theories. The Poisson bracket on a Poisson manifold provides a natural way to encode the dynamics of a classical field theory, while its quantization leads to a non-commutative algebra of observables in a quantum field theory. Despite their many applications, Poisson manifolds remain a relatively specialized area of mathematics, and their study requires a certain level of technical expertise. However, their importance in many areas of mathematics and physics makes them a fascinating subject of study for anyone interested in the intersection of geometry and algebra.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 882902}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Fred Lillywhite\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frederick Lillywhite (7 July 1829 – 15 September 1866) was a sports outfitter and cricketing entrepreneur, who organised the first overseas cricket tour by an English team and published a number of reference works about cricket.\n\nCricketing dynasty\nLillywhite was born in Hove, Sussex on 7 July 1829. He was the third son of (Frederick) William Lillywhite (1792–1854), the Sussex bowler known as the \"Nonpareil\" (\"unrivalled\"); younger brother of the batsman and umpire John Lillywhite (1826–74); and cousin of James Lillywhite (1842–1929) who captained England in the first Test match played against Australia in Melbourne in 1877.\n\nEarly business activities\nFred and John Lillywhite, as well as their elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into business as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is clear is that Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.\n\nThe Lillywhites' father died in 1854 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, North London. The following year Fred went into partnership with the Sussex all-rounder, John Wisden (1826–84), with whom he established a tobacconist and outfitter in New Coventry Street, near Leicester Square, in the West End of London. This partnership did not survive the tour to the United States and Canada in 1859 that Lillywhite (though not himself a player) organised and of which Wisden was a prominent member.\n\nBy 1860 James Lilywhite (the elder brother) was cricketing coach at Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire, where he also ran an outfitters. John Lillywhite, who had also joined the 1859 tour, was then running a cricketing warehouse near Euston Square, London. This was the forerunner of the present Lillywhites, established in Haymarket in 1863, that, following its acquisition in 1922 by I H Benedictus, moved to the Criterion site in Piccadilly Circus in 1925.\n\nThe Guide to Cricketers\nIn 1848 (still not 20) Fred Lillywhite had produced the first edition of his The Guide to Cricketers (known popularly as \"Fred's Guide\") which was published until the year of his death in 1866. This was, in many respects, the forerunner of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, founded by John Wisden in 1864, which has since been published annually, reaching its 100th edition in 1963 and 149th in 2012. From 1867 \"Fred's Guide\" was incorporated in James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Companion (first published in 1865 and known as the \"Green Lily\") which continued in that form until 1880.\n\nIn 1865 the Marylebone Cricket Club withdrew its support for Lillywhite's Guide. This falling out with the cricketing establishment seems to have arisen from the trenchancy of some of Lillywhite's observations. Significantly, in 1866, Wisden noted that \"John Wisden & Co have avoided making remarks upon the play or players\".\n\nIn the 1865 edition Lillywhite proposed that the standard height of the wicket should be raised from 27 inches to \"28, 29, or even 30 inches out of the ground\" to help avoid what he regarded as excessively high scores. This recommendation was implemented over sixty years later, in 1931, when the height was increased by an inch and the stumps were also widened.\n\nTour of the US and Canada (1859)\n\nThe touring party of 1859 left Liverpool on the SS Nova Scotian on 7 September and returned on 11 November. Its members, in addition to Wisden and John Lillywhite, were the captain George Parr (1826–91), Julius Caesar (1830–78), William Caffyn (1828–1919), Robert Carpenter (1830–1901), Alfred Diver (1824–1876), James Grundy (1824–1873), Tom Hayward (1835–76), John Jackson (1833–1910), Tom Lockyer (1826–1869) and H. H. Stephenson (1833–1896), who later led the first private tour by an England XI to Australia in 1861.\n\nFred Lillywhite travelled with his groundside tent and printing press. His role on the tour has been described as that of \"scorer, reporter, and mentor, not to say Nestor\".\n\nThe team won all five official matches against a 22 of Lower Canada (by 8 wickets at Montreal, Quebec on 26–27 September), a 22 of the United States (by an innings and 64 runs at Hoboken, NJ on 3–5 October), a different 22 of the United States (by 7 wickets at Philadelphia on 10–12 October), a 22 of Lower Canada (by 10 wickets at Hamilton, Ontario on 17–19 October) and a further 22 of the United States (by an innings and 68 runs at Rochester, NY on 21–25 October).\n\nThere were also some exhibition matches and an impromptu game of baseball when a match in New York was interrupted by snow. The team made two excursions to view the Niagara Falls.\n\nLillywhite's detailed account of the tour, The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States, was published in 1860 and reprinted over a century later, in 1980. There was coverage also in the 13th edition of his Guide to Cricketers and Caffyn gave an account in a memoir, Seventy-one Not Out, published at the end of the century.\n\nFinal years\nAfter his break with Wisden, Lillywhite was based at the Kennington Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club, from where, in 1862, he published Scores and Biographies, a major reference work about cricket since 1772. He published also various scoring books and sheets, as well as scorecards of matches.\n\nLillywhite died on 15 September 1866 at the age of 37.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nInformation on Lillywhite publications\n\nCricket historians and writers\n1866 deaths\nPeople from Hove\n1829 births", "machine_text": "Fred Lillywhite was an English cricketer, who played for Sussex and Middlesex in the mid-19th century. He is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of cricket in England and is credited with several innovations that have eventually become integral parts of the game. Born on October 25, 1829, in Westhampnett, Sussex, Lillywhite began playing cricket at an early age and soon gained recognition for his skills as a fast bowler. He made his debut for Sussex in 1853 and then joined Middlesex in 1861, where he remained until his retirement in 1873. Lillywhite is most famous for introducing the concept of scoreboard in cricket. In 1846, he set up a rudimentary scoreboard at The Oval, which displayed the scores of the ongoing match. This innovation was immediately appreciated by the crowd and soon became a permanent feature in all cricket grounds. Lillywhite was also responsible for introducing the first cricket ball-making machine, which significantly improved the standard of cricket balls. He also invented the first cricket bat with a spring handle, which allowed for greater control and precision in batsmanship. In addition to his contributions to cricket as a player and innovator, Lillywhite also played a vital role in the administration of the game. He served as a commentator, journalist, and cricket correspondent for leading newspapers and was also a prolific author of cricket books.

Arriving at the bottom of Chequamegon Bay, they settled the area that is now the west side of Ashland. As other pioneers and lumbermen began to arrive, Asaph petitioned the government to name the community Ashland.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh,  (26 November 1937 – 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.\n\nMoore was particularly noted for his \"filmstar good looks\" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.\n\nMoore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as \"Mr Privatisation\". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.\n\nMoore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.\n\nEarly life\nMoore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.\n\nHe enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a \"precinct captain\". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.\n\nMoore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.\n\nIn October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being \"an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36\".\n\nEarly political career\nCroydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.\n\nMoore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife \"... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food....\" He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;\n\nHandsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.\n\nMargaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was \"youth\". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.\n\nAfter the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as \"Mr Privatisation\".\n\nCabinet career\nMoore joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.\n\n... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered \"sharp, nasty – and effective\".\n\nBy now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The journalist Brian Walden wrote \"... he has future Tory leader written all over him\". After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.\n\nHowever, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore's earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, \"The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines\". Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for \"a good-looking fellow\" when it came to making government appointments. \"Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job.\" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.\n\nOnce established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the USA in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.\n\nMoore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be \"a soft touch\". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being \"useless\". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: \"It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do\". Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore's wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.\n\nA 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.\n\nIn November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated \"How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?\".\n\nEnd of political career\nAfter two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.\n\nMoore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.\n\nHe was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.\n\nHe gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.\n\nAfter leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech. Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates.\n\nWhile he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed\n\nArms\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1937 births\n2019 deaths\nAlumni of the London School of Economics\nBritish Secretaries of State\nEnglish stockbrokers\nConservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nConservative Party (UK) life peers\nMembers of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom\nPeople educated at Licensed Victuallers' School\nPeople from Kentish Town\nPolitics of the London Borough of Croydon\nSecretaries of State for Transport (UK)\nUK MPs 1974\nUK MPs 1974–1979\nUK MPs 1979–1983\nUK MPs 1983–1987\nUK MPs 1987–1992\nSecretaries of State for Health and Social Services\n20th-century English businesspeople", "machine_text": "John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, was a British Conservative member of parliament and cabinet minister.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Cercospora kikuchii\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cercospora kikuchii is a fungal plant pathogen that affects soybeans. It results in both the Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain diseases on soybean and is found almost worldwide.  C. kikuchii produces the toxin cercosporin, as do a number of other Cercospora species.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSeed: The disease on the host soybean itself can be determined by a light activated red perlene quinon, cercosporin, with a molecular weight of 534. Purple seed stain by Cercospora can be determined by a variety of factors. First, infected seeds have spots that are usually pink or purple. The size can be from minuscule to covering the whole seed (Li 2019). The coloration will be from the hilum area.  Germination and seedling size may be delayed after 50% of the seed is covered. They may also have lower oil and higher protein.\n\nCotyledons: Cotyledons will shrivel and fall off.\n\nStems: Stems will have red deep lesions about ¼ inch in size.\n\nLeaves: Young leaves on top and bottom will have reddish purple lesions from minuscule to ½ inch in size. The leaf itself will become purple, described as a dark bronzing.  Severely infected upper leaves will fall off (Giesler).\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe disease thrives in conditions of high temperature and humidity. “Sporulation increases as temperature rises above 80 degrees Fahrenheit” (Jeschke 2020). More wind and water (rain, river, ground water) will result in further and more spore distribution on plant tissue. It usually occurs later in the season around August. The disease survives on crop residue from four months to four years (Ward, 2015). This means it thrives on no till tilled repeat planted fields (Schapaugh 2014).\n\nManagement\n\nExtended crop rotation and residue incorporation reduces inoculum. \nSeed treatment foliar fungicides applied during R3- R5 can reduce blight incidence and severity. \nThe farmers can blend infected beans with clean and still sell them (Successful Farming Staff 2018). Dr. Anne Dorrance in 2019 also suggested planting varieties with resistance to Cercospora, plant disease free seeds, proper plant spacing to prevent spore spreading, and harvest during dry times.\n\nReferences\n\n2.

This plant disease occurs in regions where soybeans are grown, and it affects both the yield and quality of soybean crops. The fungus was first identified by Japanese plant pathologist Kenichi Kikuchi, who described it in 1910. Symptoms of Cercospora leaf blight appear on the soybean leaves as small, dark brown spots that gradually enlarge to form a target-like pattern. The infected leaves may eventually turn yellow and fall off, leading to reduced photosynthesis and eventual yield loss. Severe infections can also affect the stems and pods of the soybean plant. Cercospora kikuchii can spread rapidly through airborne spores and may survive in crop debris, soil, and infected soybean seeds. Therefore, it is essential to practice crop rotation and avoid planting soybean crops in the same area for several years to prevent the pathogen's build-up in the soil. Fungicides can be applied to control Cercospora leaf blight, but the best approach is to use resistant soybean varieties. Many soybean cultivars have been developed with resistance to Cercospora leaf blight, and farmers should select resistant varieties to reduce economic losses due to the disease.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Zirkle Mill\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Andrew Zirkle Mill is a 1760s era grist mill located in the southern end of Shenandoah County, Virginia.  The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 after being restored by Glenn Hofecker, the owner at the time.  The mill is cited as a prime example of the architecture and construction of grist mills and manufacturing facilities of its era.\n\nVirginia Historic Landmark \nBuilt by German pioneers who moved to the area from Pennsylvania in the 1750s, the mill is a remnant of the culture, industriousness and vision of these early settlers.  Its use, architecture, builders, owners and location place it in the forefront of early frontier life. Added to the Virginia Historic Landmark Registry in 1982.\n\nAbout the mill \nIn 1749, Thomas Lord Fairfax issued a land grant for  to George Brock. Brock sold this land in 1757 to Andrew Zirkle, who had arrived in the area in 1755 with four brothers, two sisters and his mother. Shortly thereafter, Andrew and his brothers built the mill.\n\nWhile the exact date of the construction of the mill remains a mystery, there is a variety of evidence that shows it was built and in operation by 1781. Anecdotal evidence places its construction in the early 1760s.\n\nThe mill has a log frame and uses mortice and tenon construction. The main beams of the mill, of which there are six, are huge timber beams. These beams are one piece, each of which are  long and over one foot square. The mill rests on a coursed rubblestone foundation built into the hillside.  A portion of the mill foundation rests on solid bed of limestone that protrudes from the hill. There is also a large natural cleft in the rocks where the waterwheel now resides.\n\nThe waterwheel is fed by a mill race that extends nearly 1/2 mile upstream to the mill dam located on Holman's Creek.  As it nears the mill, the water runs into a raised wooden flume to be fed to the Fitz Waterwheel.  The waterwheel is 20½ feet in diameter and  wide. It was manufactured by the Fitz Waterwheel company of Hanover, PA was installed in the spring of 1921.\n\nInside the mill is a collection of equipment spanning the entire lifespan of the mill.  The original granite and French quartz millstones are present, roller milling machines installed just before 1900, sifters, bolters, and other items. The mill also features a Fitz gearing installed in the basement that takes the power from the waterwheel and uses it to drive all the equipment.\n\nHistory of the mill \nThe American historian George Bancroft writes of contributions made by citizens to relieve \"the poor of Boston\" during the hardships caused by the blockading of the harbor after the Boston Tea Party. Bancroft specifically mentions contributions made by settlers in the Northern Shenandoah Valley, citing  of flour being brought into Winchester. The Boston Tea Party occurred in December 1773 and with the passage of the Intolerable Acts which contained the Boston Port Bill, the harbor was ordered closed June 1, 1774.\n\nIn \"A History of Shenandoah County\", written by Shenandoah Valley historian John W. Wayland, these contributions are cited and Wayland gives his interpretation of Bancrofts' writings, stating that mills of Shenandoah County provided some of this flour. It is family tradition that the Zirkle Mill was one of the sources for this flour. This claim is given further credence by the Shenandoah County Publick Claims which show that in 1781 Andrew Zirkle contributed six barrels of flour to the Continental Army.\n\nThe mill is mentioned in a 1784 petition from local residents to build a road from the mill east to the town of New Market, VA.  Andrew Zirkle, his brother Michael and other residents signed the petition.  The Order Book of Shenandoah County Court lists instructions for Michael Zirkle, Andrew Zirkle, Jacob Neff and Benjamin Fossett \"view a way for a Road from Andrew Sircles Mill to Abraham Dusks Smith Shop on the Main Road\" and that they report their findings to the next court.\n\nIn 1817, Andrew directed the executor of his will to sell the mill and distribute the proceeds among his descendants. The mill was subsequently sold to George Mowrey who was apparently his miller at the time. Mowery was unable to hold onto the mill and it passed through a number of owners until it was purchased by Peter Myers who lived just outside Forestville, VA in 1853.\n\nWar had once again come to the valley as the north and south faced off against each other in the Civil War. After driving Confederate General Jubal Early from the field at the Battle of Fisher's Hill, Union General Phillip Sheridan pursued him as far south as Harrisonburg and McGaheysville, Virginia. There he stopped as he feared Confederate Troops from the Richmond area might move to his rear and trap his army between two forces.\n\nGeneral Sheridan received orders from General Ulysses S. Grant to burn \"the breadbasket of the Confederacy.\" Sheridan then executed a strategic retreat northward towards Winchester and Union troops rode the width of the valley setting fields, barns and mills ablaze.\n\nAt the Zirkle Mill, the miller Samuel Hockman climbed the hill facing the mill. In the distance he could see the mills at nearby Moore's Store, Harpinetown and the Myers farm being set ablaze. He ran and got a Union Flag, climbed onto the roof of the mill and hung it there.\n\nHe ran to meet the Union Cavalry officers in the road. The flag and his pleadings convinced them of his sincerity and the troops were ordered to leave the mill alone. It was the only mill on Holman's creek to survive that day. The General in charge of the Union Cavalry in this area was none other than George Armstrong Custer.  This fantastic tale is recounted in \"The Burning: Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley\" by Professor John Heatwhole.\n\nAfter the war, the local people branded Hockman as a Union sympathizer and refused to patronize the mill and soon the owner Peter Myers was forced to sell.  Joseph Andrick purchased the mill in 1867 and operated it until his death in 1893. His sons Casper and Charles ran the mill for a number of years and upgraded the mill by installing roller milling equipment. Much of this equipment is still in the mill today.\n\nAfter the Andrick brothers sold the mill in 1906 it again passed through a number of owners hands each trying his hand at the milling trade. Finally, in the late 1940s, no longer able to compete with modernized factories the mill finally ceased operations after 180 years.\n\nMill campaign \nThe mill sat neglected for many years until in 1980 it was bought by a North Carolina carpenter named Glen Hofecker, who restored it to working order. It was during this time that the mill was added to the Virginia Historic Landmark Register in 1992 and then placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\n\nHofecker sold the mill at auction in 1992 to Bowman Fruit Sales, LLC controlled by Gordon D. \"Sonny\" Bowman, a local orchardist.\n\nBowman Fruit Sales owned the mill for 11 years and then decided to sell it. The mill was placed on the open market for a year with no takers. Finally, the Frontier Culture Museum of Staunton, Virginia came calling. They were looking for a mill to be the centerpiece of an exhibit on 1850s life and announced plans to move the upper portion of the mill to museum property in Staunton, Virginia. Two Zirkle descendants, Rob Andrews and Sherryl Andrews Belinsky formed the Save the Zirkle Mill Foundation (now called Old Dominion Preservation) and conducted a year-long campaign to save the mill.\n\nThe Frontier Culture Museum is state funded and is restricted by acquisition laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The purchase of the mill property was highly irregular. After taking the case to the State Attorney General's office, the Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the Governor of Virginia must approve the acquisition of the mill by the museum as dictated by state laws.\n\nIn July 2005, Governor Mark Warner denied the acquisition of the mill by the museum. Bowman Fruit Sales waited a few months and quietly put the mill up for sale again. While it had become famous, there were few takers. Andrews and Belinsky made an offer for the mill and on January 5, 2006 became the owners of the Andrew Zirkle Mill.\n\nA new beginning \n\nThe new owners have begun the process of bringing the mill back to life.  While the project is expected to take many years, plans are being made and events have been held to further this goal.  Signage has been added to the property and recently a historic highway marker was added in the parking lot across the road from the mill.  The Highway Marker was donated by the Knight-Patty Fund of the Virginia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.\n\nA number of site improvements are underway and a portion of the grounds has been turned to agricultural use.  Due to the numerous safety improvements required and the need to proceed slowly with changes, the mill is currently closed to the public.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n www.historiczirklemill.org\n\nGrinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia\nNational Register of Historic Places in Shenandoah County, Virginia\nIndustrial buildings completed in 1781\nBuildings and structures in Shenandoah County, Virginia\nGrinding mills in Virginia\nGerman-American culture in Virginia\nPennsylvania German culture in Virginia", "machine_text": "Zirkle Mill is a historic grist mill located in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, United States.

In 2002, the Shenandoah County Historical Society purchased the property and began the process of restoration. The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Today, the mill is open to the public as a living museum, offering visitors a chance to see how flour was produced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The mill still operates using the original milling equipment, which includes two sets of millstones, a sifter, and a bolter. Visitors can watch as the miller grinds corn, wheat, and other grains into flour and meal. Zirkle Mill also features exhibits of historic tools and artifacts related to milling and farming. The miller's house has been restored to its original 19th-century appearance and houses a gift shop and an interpretive center.

The race was the second to be held at the track during the 1983 Winston Cup Series, with the other being the 1983 World 600. Bruton Smith and Curtis Turner began building the track in 1959, and despite numerous delays, the track was finished in 1960 for the inaugural World 600.\n\nRace report\nThere were 40 drivers on the grid; 39 of them were American while Trevor Boys was the only Canadian. Sterling Marlin would rack up a last-place finish due to an engine failure on lap 53 out of the 334 being raced that day. Richard Petty defeated Darrell Waltrip by 3.1 seconds in front of 118,000 spectators in a time of three hours and thirty-four minutes; making him have 94 more wins than the next driver on the all-time wins list. There were 30 different lead changes and eight caution periods for 35 laps.\n\nTim Richmond acquired the pole position with a top speed of  in qualifying while the average race speed was . Richmond led 99 laps in the race and finished in fifth-place. The race developed a sudden and chaotic turn of events on lap 184, Darrell Waltrip managed to keep the lead for an entire lap on a field of speedy drivers before being overtaken by Bill Elliott in time for lap 185.\n\nJ.D. McDuffie would fail to qualify for this race along with Laurent Rioux (#38), Bosco Lowe, Randy Baker and Travis Tiller.\n\nOn the day of the race, 0.11 inches of precipitation were recorded around the speedway.\n\nFollowing the last caution flag and pit stops of the race, Darrell Waltrip, driving Junior Johnson's #11 Chevy led the race over Tim Richmond in the #27 Raymond Beadle Pontiac after the restart with 23 laps to go. Richard Petty was in third place. With less than ten laps to go Waltrip's car noticeably slowed and appeared to wiggle slightly exiting turn two and allowed Petty to duck below for the lead and race win. Cale Yarborough in the #28 Ranier Racing Chevy was two laps down and also passed Waltrip and was on Petty's rear bumper when the checkered flag fell. The race highlights are available to view on YouTube. No direct link is allowed.\n\nDuring victory lane celebrations a NASCAR official noticed that Petty's race car had left side tires mounted on the right side of the car, which was a violation of the rules. NASCAR sent Petty's Pontiac into the enclosed Union 76 garage inspection area for a complete engine teardown and detailed inspection.\n\nAfter a four-hour inspection of the Petty Enterprises race car, NASCAR determined the engine in Petty's car was over the limit in cubic inches as specified in the rule book. The Petty team was penalized 104 points and fined $35,000 for the rule violations involving the tires and engine. The engine was determined to be , well over the specifications in the NASCAR rulebook for 1983 which stipulated a maximum of .\n\nPetty co-crew chiefs, Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard, stated that during the last pit stop of the race they put softer compound bias-ply tires designed for the left side of the cars on the right side of Petty's race car. The softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to the right side of a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on the right side of the cars.\n\nNASCAR allowed the win to stand because the second place car of Waltrip was quickly removed from the track in the team hauler rig after the race ended and could not be inspected to determine if it was legal or not. NASCAR stated that they wanted fans to leave the track knowing who won the race.\n\nIronically, ten years earlier at this race the winning Chevy of Cale Yarborough (owned by Junior Johnson) and Richard Petty's second place Dodge were both submitted to long inspections after the race for allegedly having oversized engines. NASCAR admitted in the days after the 1973 race controversy that their pre-race inspection system needed to be improved.\n\nThis was the 198th race win in Petty's career.  The total amount of prize money offered to all NASCAR Winston Cup Series drivers for this race was a then-incredible $352,430. and was one of the top paying races of the 1983 season.\n\nTop 10 finishers\n\nStandings after the race\n\nReferences\n\nMiller High Life 500\nMiller High Life 500\nNASCAR races at Charlotte Motor Speedway", "machine_text": "The 1983 Miller High Life 500 was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race held on June 5 of that year at the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Primate experiments at Columbia University\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Primate experiments at Columbia University came to public attention in October 2003, when CNN reported that a university veterinarian had approached its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee about experiments being carried out there on baboons.\n\nThe veterinarian complained about experiments being conducted by an assistant professor of neurology and neurosurgery, E. Sander Connolly, who was causing strokes in baboons by carefully removing their left eyeballs and using the empty eye sockets to reach a critical blood vessel to their brains, known as the internal carotid artery. A clamp temporarily was placed on this blood vessel until the stroke was induced, after which Connolly would test  a potential neuroprotective drug. Connolly developed this methodology to make more consistent stroke infarcts in primates, which would improve the detection of differences in stroke treatment groups, and  \"provide important information not obtainable in rodent models.\". Of note, a more extensive version of this operation, known as an orbitozygomatic osteotomy, is also performed in humans for treatment of certain brain tumors and vascular malformations. It does not result in blindness or permanent removal of the eye. It is done because it is deemed safer way to access the bottom portions of the brain rather than going through the brain.\n\nIn a letter to the National Institutes of Health, PETA described one experiment: \"On September 19, 2001, baboon B777's left eye was removed, and a stroke was induced. The next morning, it was noted that the animal could not sit up, that he was leaning over, and that he could not eat. That evening, the baboon was still slouched over and was offered food but couldn't chew. On September 21, 2001, the record shows that the baboon was 'awake, but no movement, can't eat (chew), vomited in the a.m.' With no further notation about consulting with a veterinarian, the record reads, 'At 1:30 p.m. the animal died in the cage.'\" \n\n\nReaction\nIn a letter to PETA, neurologist Robert S. Hoffman stated that he regards such experiments to be a \"blind alley,\" and that the baboons are \"kept alive for either three or ten days after experiencing a major stroke and in a condition of profound disability. This is obviously as terrifying for animals as it is for humans unless one believes that animals are incapable of terror or other emotional distress\" Wayback Machine . According to the published stroke model by Connolly, animals are given a stroke and maintained on anesthesia and analgesia for 12–18 hours. Then, when anesthesia is removed, animals that are not self-caring are euthanized. All other animals may be kept alive for three days, in accordance with established ethical guidelines. Then, if animals are not self-caring, they are euthanized. Animals that are self-caring at 72 hours may be kept alive for up to 10 days.\n\nA USDA investigation of the Columbia baboons found \"no indication that the experiments...violated federal guidelines.\" Further, the Dean of Research at Columbia's School of Medicine noted that Connolly stopped the experiments because of threats from animal rights activists, despite the fact that Connolly \"remained convinced that his experiments were humane and potentially valuable.\"\n\nNotes\n\nAnimal testing in the United States\nEthically disputed research practices towards animals\nAnimal testing on non-human primates", "machine_text": "Primate experiments at Columbia University have been an ongoing area of research since the early 20th century. The experiments have been conducted on various species of primates including chimpanzees, macaques, and baboons. Research has been focused on various areas including neuroscience, psychology, and behavior. However, these experiments have been subject to controversy due to ethical concerns. One of the most controversial areas of research at Columbia University has been in the field of neuroscience. Researchers at the university have conducted experiments on primates to study the brain and have explored the effects of different drugs on certain neurological conditions. These experiments often involve invasive procedures including the implantation of electrodes into the brain. Another area of research at Columbia involves the study of primate behavior. Researchers here aim to observe social interactions and group dynamics in a controlled environment. The ultimate goal is to better understand primate behavior and develop strategies to improve the welfare of these animals in captivity. However, these experiments have drawn criticism from animal welfare activists who claim that the experiments have caused unnecessary harm and suffering to the primates involved. They argue that experiments of this kind are often unethical and unnecessary, as alternative methods of research can yield similar results without harming animals. Despite the controversy, Columbia University remains committed to their research on primates. The university has implemented policies to ensure the ethical treatment of animals used in research, including stringent protocols for obtaining animal welfare approval and oversight. In conclusion, primate experiments at Columbia University continue to be a subject of controversy. While these experiments have contributed to scientific advances, it is important to consider the ethical implications and strive towards animal welfare-friendly research practices.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14681002}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Schnellbomber\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Schnellbomber (German; literally \"fast bomber\") is a bomber that relies upon speed to avoid enemy fighters, rather than relying on defensive armament and armor.\n\nConcept\nThe concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance.\n\nAdolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the Schnellbomber and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the Schnellbomber, lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and its heavier twin-engine Bf 110 counterpart due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first aircraft adopted for the Schnellbomber role was the single-engine Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engine Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability.\n\nBomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the Schnellbomber, and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940.\n\nJapan's air war in China\nAs World War II broke out in Asia with the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Navy dispatched dozens of their unescorted Mitsubishi G3M bombers in the schnellbomber strategy of Giulio Douhet's total war concept of attacks against Chinese Air Force assets as well as civilian targets, however, the strategy backfired as the Japanese underestimated the effectiveness of the Chinese air raid early-warning net and the numbers of experienced Chinese pilots leading their squadrons of Curtiss Hawk III (max-speed marginally slower than G3M) and Boeing P-26 Model 281 (max-speed marginally faster than G3M) fighters in a bloody rout against the Japanese bombers. Nonetheless, the total war strategy with the schnellbomber wasn't lost to the Japanese, as the Chinese lost many of their top fighter pilots by Fall of Nanking at the end of 1937, and with ever-growing Japanese blockade of war materials and high-octane aviation fuel particularly following the capture of Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, the increasing obsolescence of Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel versus fast and high-flying massed bomber formations burning high-octane avgas continued to wreak havoc and devastation against Chinese cities for years to come, particularly in the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu beginning in May 1939; eventually however, the United States enacted an oil and steel embargo against Japan in July 1941.\n\nGermany's quest for \"fast bombers\"\nThe Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer Schnellbombers, as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as Schnellbombers by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 Blitz (dubbed \"the fastest bomber\" – \"Schnellstbomber\").\n\nSeveral other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 — meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start — as a new Zerstörer heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765 km/h (475 mph).  The Bomber B high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original Schnellbomber role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier Schnellbomber designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the Bomber B program.\n\nde Havilland Mosquito\nThe most successful Schnellbomber of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own Schnellbomber concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all-wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name Moskito.\n\nSee also\nBomber B - 1939 design competition, meant to replace all bombers in Luftwaffe service\nFighter-bomber\nLight bomber\n\nReferences\n\nBomber aircraft\nLuftwaffe", "machine_text": "Schnellbomber was a German term used during World War II to refer to a high-speed bomber used by the German Luftwaffe. The word translates to \"fast bomber\" in English. The aircraft was specifically designed for high speed and was used for tactical bombing, reconnaissance, and close air support. The first aircraft to be designated as a Schnellbomber was the Junkers Ju 88, which entered service in 1939. It was a versatile aircraft that could be used for many different roles, including night fighting and maritime attacks. The Ju 88 was powered by twin engines and had a top speed of around 560 km/h. It could carry a heavy bomb load of up to 3,500 kg. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was another aircraft that was sometimes referred to as a Schnellbomber. It was a single-engine fighter-bomber that was fast, heavily armed, and highly maneuverable. The Fw 190 could carry up to 500 kg of bombs and had a top speed of around 700 km/h. Other notable Schnellbombers included the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Heinkel He 219. These aircraft were primarily used for nighttime bombing, barge-busting, and ground-attack duties. The Bf 110 had a top speed of around 560 km/h and could carry a bomb load of up to 2,500 kg. The He 219 was a twin-engine fighter-bomber that had a top speed of around 620 km/h and was heavily armed with cannons and machine guns. By the end of the war, the Schnellbomber concept had been largely superseded by jet-powered aircraft, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262. However, these high-speed bombers played an important role in the German war effort and helped to establish the Luftwaffe's reputation as a force to be reckoned with.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1791957}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hanky Panky (Madonna song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American recording artist Madonna from her soundtrack album I'm Breathless. It was released on June 12, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from a line in the parent film, Dick Tracy, talking about a woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, \"Hanky Panky\" is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke.\n\nThe song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting its lyrical content. It was a commercial success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours: Blond Ambition (1990) and Re-Invention (2004). The song has been covered by several tribute acts and was also performed on the television series Ally McBeal (1997).\n\nBackground and release\nIn 1990, Madonna starred in the film Dick Tracy as Breathless Mahoney—a new role introduced for her—with Warren Beatty, her boyfriend at the time, playing the titular character. After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs written by Stephen Sondheim for the film—\"Sooner or Later\", \"More\" and \"What Can You Lose\"—which would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to her previous releases. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. \"I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel\", she said at the time.\n\nMadonna recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. \"Hanky Panky\" was written and produced by Madonna and Leonard and was released as the second and final single from I'm Breathless on June 12, 1990. The cassette and the 7-inch versions had \"More\", another song from the album as its B-side, while the 12-inch releases had two remixes of the song by Kevin Gilbert. Cover photograph for the single was done by Patrick Demarchelier with Jeri Heiden designing the sleeves.\n\nRecording and composition\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was recorded within the three weeks time taken for the whole project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centred around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a \"good spanking\". It is performed in an almost comical style and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, \"You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me\". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–C–Bm–A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm–A–B9–A7–Dm–C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained:\nThe spanking thing started because I believed that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around with people like Al Pacino's character. Warren [Beatty] asked me to write some songs, and one of them—the hanky-panky song—was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle, I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.\nThe singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line \"I'll settle for the back of your hand\"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song \"highly dangerous\" while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was \"extremely harmful\". Although initially approving of the idea of \"getting spanked\"—even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show—Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.\n\nCritical response\n\nJ. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, commented that \"the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply sounds like a silly innocent romp until you realize what she's going on and on is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!\". The author also felt Madonna sang with \"just a little too much authority\". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it \"a comic hymn to spanking\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a \"double entendre-laden hit\". Bill Coleman from Billboard called it a \"steamy and suggestive jumpin' jive\". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted \"Hanky Panky\" as one of the best tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a \"fake period piece\" but praising its \"risqué s&m-lite\" sound as \"all her\". Ernest Hardy from Cash Box said it \"is a tribute to the pleasures of light S&M, done in a brassy '30s style. Madonna sings in a lower key than ususal, tosses off risque lines, and heads for the top of the charts with barely an effort.\" David Giles from Music Week stated that it \"finds Madonna flirting in a big way with Forties swing music.\" He added, \"Pure Hollywood stuff\". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside \"Cry Baby\" and \"I'm Going Bananas\", was one of the \"more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco\" on the album. He also noted that \"its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour.\" People magazine called it a \"paean to kink\". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it \"goofy (but catchy!)\". In August 2018, Joel Lynch from the same magazine ranked it as the singer's 100th greatest song, calling it an \"enjoyably (and cartoonishly) amorous big-band swing song\" and comparing Madonna's vocals to Betty Boop. Greg Sandow, from Entertainment Weekly, called it a \"delightful challenge to censorship\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt it was a  \"cheeky\" song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s. \n\nStephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a \"big-band blues [song] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage\". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described \"Hanky Panky\" as \"naughty\", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song \"Makin' Whoopee\" by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that \"one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when you push her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' is one of the few pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking.\" For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"it gets points for its boldness and audacity. Yet it never truly rises above its novelty status\". Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B. King believed that the subject matter of \"Hanky Panky\" would surely receive \"flank\", but defended Madonna saying that she had been singing about such topics for years by then.\nThe Huffington Post ranked the song fifth on their list of \"The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs\"; author Pandora Boxx hailed it as \"a great fusion of '90s pop and vintage '30s\", but noted that \"its 'scandalous' subject matter ruffled too many feathers to make it a big hit\". Also from The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs ranked it at number 55 on his list of \"The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles\", calling it \"pure fun, '30s swing style [...] its lyrics are sillier than they ought to be, but the fabulous beat refuses to let your dancing shoes collect dust\". Writing for Gay Star News, Joe Morgan gave a mixed review, calling it \"less sexual and feminist liberation and more corny and blatant [...] A forgettable number that sounds like track six of a musical theatre cast album\". A negative review came from Royal S. Brown, author of Film Musings: A Selected Anthology from Fanfare Magazine, who called it \"ridiculous\". Also negative was The Guardians Jude Rogers, who wrote that \"even creators of brilliant pop can go wrong\", calling it \"over farty\" and \"Madonna's nadir\".\n\nChart performance\nFollowing its release, \"Hanky Panky\" was initially blacklisted at some radio stations when they faced objections from audiences about the lyrical content. Nevertheless, it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 40 the week of June 30, 1990, as \"Vogue\" was descending from the top ten. The single quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number ten the week of July 28, 1990. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 19, 1990, for shipments of 500,000 copies. Billboard ranked it at number 36 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 92 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 18 on the week of September 1, 1990. It was present for a total of 13 weeks on the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart and after two weeks, reached its peak of number two the week of July 27, 1990; spent a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on August 1, 1990, for shipments of 200,000 copies. According to the Official Charts Company, the single has sold over 210,000 copies as of October 2010. In Australia, \"Hanky Panky\" debuted at number 18 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of July 29, 1990, and peaked at number six four weeks later. It was ranked at number 45 on the ARIA year-end chart. In New Zealand, the single debuted at number 23 on RIANZ Singles Chart and, after fluctuating for the next three weeks, reached a peak of number six, becoming Madonna's 18th top-ten single in the country. In the European nations, \"Hanky Panky\" reached the top-ten of the charts in Ireland, as well as topping the charts in Finland. In other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, it managed to peak within the top 20 of the charts.\n\nLive performances and covers\n\n\"Hanky Panky\" was first performed on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song dressed in a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer, standing in front of a microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: \"You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?\". Regarding the \"shameless promotion\" of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that \"along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show\". Two different performances  were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.\n\nFourteen years later, Madonna performed an energetic showgirl themed version of \"Hanky Panky\" as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. She appeared onstage dressed in a circus themed outfit, consisting of black hot pants, red high heels, headband and a red and white striped 1920s flapper  style bustier. Sean Piccoli, from the Sun-Sentinel, praised the singer's ability to \"summon the vampy humor of 'Hanky Panky'—a Bette Midler moment if ever [Madonna] had one\". In May 2000, the song was performed by actress Alicia Witt on the third-season finale of the American television series Ally McBeal, titled \"The Musical, Almost\". An Indie cover version by the band Killer Nannies In America, was included on the 2000 tribute album The Material Girl: A Tribute to Madonna. The Gary Tesca Orchestra included an instrumental version of the song on their album Who's That Girl: The Madonna Story, Vol. 1 (2006).\n\nTrack listings and formats\n\nUS and European 7-inch single; Japanese 3-inch CD single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (LP version) – 3:57\n \"More\" (LP version) – 4:59\n\nAustralian, European, and US 12-inch single and CD maxi-single\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix) – 6:34\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix) – 3:50\n \"More\" (album version) – 4:59\n\nDigital single (2020)\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bones single mix) – 3:50\n \"Hanky Panky\" (Bare Bottom 12-inch mix) – 6:36\n \"More\" (LP version) – 4:59\n\nCredits and personnel\n Madonna – writer, vocals, producer\n Patrick Leonard – writer, producer, keyboard\n Jeff Porcaro – drums\n Guy Pratt – bass\n Donna De Lory – background vocals\n Niki Haris – background vocals\n N'Dea Davenport – background vocals\n Kevin McGuilbert – remix and additional production\n Patrick Demarchelier – cover photographer\n Jeri Heiden – designer\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications and sales\n\nSee also\nList of European number-one airplay songs of the 1990s\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\"Hanky Panky\" on Spotify\n\n1990 singles\nMadonna (entertainer) songs\nSongs about BDSM\nSongs written by Madonna (entertainer)\nSongs written by Patrick Leonard\nSong recordings produced by Madonna (entertainer)\nSong recordings produced by Patrick Leonard\nVocal jazz songs\nNumber-one singles in Finland\n1990 songs\nSwing music\nMusic controversies\nAmerican jazz songs\nSire Records singles\nWarner Records singles", "machine_text": "\"Hanky Panky\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna, and it was released as the second single from her 1990 album \"I'm Breathless: Music from and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy\". The song was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and it was inspired by the 1930s era, which was also the main fashion and style theme of the \"Dick Tracy\" film. The song's lyrics are playful and coy, featuring a flirty Madonna inviting her lover to play \"hanky panky\" with her. The song's instrumentation includes a simple and repetitive guitar riff, along with punchy brass and woodwinds that evoke the sound of a 1930s big band. Upon release, \"Hanky Panky\" received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised the song's retro charm and Madonna's vocal performance, while others found it too simplistic and lacking in sophistication. The song was a commercial success, however, reaching the top ten in several countries and becoming a fan favorite among Madonna's repertoire. The music video for \"Hanky Panky\" featured Madonna and her backup dancers in 1930s-style cabaret outfits, performing a choreographed routine in a flashy club. The video received acclaim for its stylish visuals and energetic dance sequences, and it was directed by the renowned photographer and filmmaker Herb Ritts. In conclusion, \"Hanky Panky\" is a playful and memorable song from Madonna's discography, showcasing her ability to blend retro influences with contemporary pop sensibilities. The song's catchy chorus and playful lyrics have made it a beloved classic among Madonna fans, and its music video is a testament to Madonna's ability to create iconic visuals that are both stylish and entertaining.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3732808}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"A Hole in the Sock of (Dave Davies)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Hole in the Sock of Dave Davies refers to an unreleased album of solo material by Dave Davies, lead guitarist and co-founder of British rock band the Kinks. Apparently the album was, at least for a time, intended to be released under the name Lincoln County, however, numerous names have been applied to it, including The Album That Never Was.\n\nBackground\nIn July 1967, Dave Davies readied his first solo single, credited entirely under his name (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies), entitled \"Death of a Clown\". In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of larger LPs. The Kinks' record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued \"Death of a Clown\" as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was, in fact, the Kinks.\n\nUpon release, \"Death of a Clown\" unexpectedly rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit off the new buzz that was suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was scheduled for release some time in 1968 or 1969.\n\nA follow-up single, \"Susannah's Still Alive\", was released in November 1967. However, it only reached number 20 on Melody Maker. The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, fans nicknamed it A Hole in the Sock Of. The name was based on a remark Ray Davies had made to a reporter during an interview about the title of Dave's forthcoming solo album and was, although meant ironically, taken seriously. The title was a send up possibly of the Beatles ambitious \"A Day in the Life\" or Traffic's \"Hole In My Shoe\".\n\n\"Lincoln County\" was chosen as the next single but failed to chart. With subsequent singles meeting the same result, a combination of Davies' own lack of interest in continuing and Pye's decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Davies stated that:\n\nI was quite surprised when management and the record company wanted me to make an album. I thought it was quite daunting. There were a couple of tunes I liked - 'Suzannah's Still Alive,' 'Lincoln County' - but it had to feel right, and it didn't feel right. I did a few songs in a demo studio and I knocked out three or four songs, and one of them was 'Creeping Jean,' and I started to get very depressed about the whole idea. One of the last songs I recorded then was 'I'm Crying,' so you can tell what frame of mind I was in.\n\nRecording and tracks\nTechnically work began on the project after the unexpected success of \"Death of a Clown\". Initially, proposed material included blues numbers by Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy in addition to original material; ultimately, lack of both original material and interest delayed further work on an LP until the very end of 1968, when four new songs were recorded at Polydor Studios in London. Work was to have completed early in 1969 but was delayed at least partly when Dave Davies fractured a finger. Much of the unissued material seems to have been recorded in June 1969, just after completion of recordings for Arthur (with John Dalton, not Pete Quaife, on bass). Two titles (\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\" and \"Mindless Child of Motherhood\"), both released as B-sides of Kinks singles were recorded as part of the Arthur sessions, but ultimately not included on that LP's final track selection. \n\nReprise files imply that Reprise received tapes of this album, under the title Lincoln County, in July 1969 while it was still considered for release by the band. By September of that year, the decision was made not to release the album. Throughout 1970, reports of a reworked version with new material were discussed; the possibility of issuing Dave's LP as the second half of a 2-LP set was raised, but by the close of that year all talk of the LP's release had ceased. Oddly, tapes of this LP were not officially logged into Reprise's official master tape log until 1972, as part of their contractual settlement after the Kinks moved to RCA. Short of the existence of this acetate in their vaults, there is no other indication that Reprise ever seriously considered this LP for release in its entirety. All songs were mixed (in the case of \"Susannah's Still Alive\", remixed) in stereo for this release. The track listing given here is per Doug Hinman.\n\n\"Susannah's Still Alive\" (released as a single in 1967, remixed stereo version released on Kink Kronikles)\n\"There Is No Life Without Love\" (released as a b-side of \"Lincoln Country\", mono version released on The Album That Never Was and bonus tracks for Something Else', mono version released on the 2011 Deluxe Mono version of \"Arthur\"\n\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\" (released as a b-side of \"Shangri-La\", mono version released on the 2011 Deluxe Mono version of \"Arthur\"\n\"Mindless Child of Motherhood\" (released as a b-side of \"Drivin'\", both mono and stereo version released on Arthur CD re-release)\n\"Hold My Hand\" (released as a single in 1969, mono version released on The Album That Never Was; stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Do You Wish To Be a Man?\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Are You Ready?\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Creeping Jean\" (released as a b-side of \"Hold My Hand\", stereo version released on the 2004 Deluxe Edition of Village Green Preservation Society, mono version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"I'm Crying\" (stereo version released on Hidden Treasures)\n\"Lincoln County\" (released as a single in 1968, mono version released on The Album That Never Was and bonus tracks for Something Else CD re-release) (longer stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Mr. Shoemaker's Daughter\" (stereo version released on Arthur CD re-release)\n\"Mr. Reporter\" (stereo version released on Face to Face and remixed stereo version released on 2011 Arthur deluxe edition)\n\"Groovy Movies\" (stereo version released on the 2004 Deluxe Edition of Village Green Preservation Society)\n\nThe Album That Never Was\nAlthough the unreleased album is sometimes called The Album That Never Was, several other unreleased Kinks projects were called this over time.

Dave Davies, the lead guitarist of the band, was said to have a hole in his sock, which led to a memorable and improvised exchange during their performance of \"You Really Got Me\". According to reports, Davies' sock had come undone during the performance, leaving a hole visible to audiences. Lead singer Ray Davies noticed this and called attention to it, leading to a playful banter between the two brothers. Dave Davies reportedly responded, \"It's a new pair of socks, Ray. They must have been in a fight!\" The incident became famous among Kinks fans and has even been referenced in subsequent performances by the band. It is seen as a testament to the band's improvisational skills and their ability to interact with each other and their audience. The Kinks were a British rock band that formed in 1964 and became one of the most influential bands of the 1960s British Invasion. Their sound was characterized by their use of power chords and Ray Davies' distinctive storytelling lyrics. Despite their success, the band experienced numerous personal conflicts and lineup changes over the years. Dave Davies' relationship with his brother and lead singer had been tumultuous, with both brothers sometimes engaging in physical altercations. Today, A Hole in the Sock of (Dave Davies) is often remembered as an amusing and lighthearted moment in the band's history.

As a junior officer he twice volunteered to take part in missions to search for Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to find the Northwest Passage.

He became commander of the steam reserve at Devonport in 1873 and captain-superintendent of Pembroke Dock in March 1875 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 29 May 1875.\n\nSenior command\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 27 September 1877, Hamilton was appointed Director of Naval Ordnance at the Admiralty in 1878. He was given command of the Coast of Ireland Station in 1880 and, having been promoted to vice admiral on 17 February 1884, he became commander-in-chief of China Station in September 1885; he took his fleet into Vladivostok harbour the following year and gave the Russians a surprise. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887 and promoted to full admiral on 18 October 1887.\n\nHamilton went on to be Second Naval Lord in December 1888, and First Naval Lord in July 1889.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lucas aggregate supply function\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Lucas aggregate supply function or Lucas \"surprise\" supply function, based on the Lucas imperfect information model, is a representation of aggregate supply based on the work of new classical economist Robert Lucas.  The model states that economic output is a function of money or price \"surprise\".  The model accounts for the empirically based trade off between output and prices represented by the Phillips curve, but the function breaks from the Phillips curve since only unanticipated price level changes lead to changes in output.  The model accounts for empirically observed short-run correlations between output and prices, but maintains the neutrality of money (the absence of a price or money supply relationship with output and employment) in the long-run.  The policy ineffectiveness proposition extends the model by arguing that, since people with rational expectations cannot be systematically surprised by monetary policy, monetary policy cannot be used to systematically influence the economy.\n\nBackground \nNew classical economics made its first attempt to model aggregate supply in Lucas and Leonard Rapping (1969).  In this earlier model, supply (specifically labor supply) is a direct function of real wages: more work will be done when real wages are high and less when they are low. Under this model, unemployment is \"voluntary\". In 1972 Lucas made a second attempt at modelling aggregate supply.  This attempt drew from Milton Friedman's natural rate hypothesis that challenged the Phillips curve.  Lucas supported his original, theoretical paper that outlined the surprise based supply curve with an empirical paper that demonstrated that countries with a history of stable price levels exhibit larger effects in response to monetary policy than countries where prices have been volatile.\n\nOn the basis of Lucas' 1973 paper, Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace introduced their 'surprise' supply function in which there was a white noise error term introduced that cannot be predicted in any way. Lucas introduced the effects of nominal and real shocks affecting a macro-economy into his system through price expectations: if expectations are true, output in any given period is at its natural level. However, the well-known and widely accepted aggregate production function described by Sargent and Wallace also provides leeway for the white-noise shocks independent of price expectations–resulting in the accidental nature of equilibrium and in the inefficacy of countercyclical efforts of monetary policy.\n\nLucas's model dominated new classical economic business cycle theory until 1982 when real business cycle theory, starting with Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, replaced Lucas's theory of a money driven business cycle with a strictly supply based model that used technology and other real shocks to explain fluctuations in output.\n\nTheory \nThe rationale behind Lucas's supply theory centers on how suppliers get information.  Lucas claimed that suppliers had to respond to a \"signal extraction\" problem when making decisions based on prices; the firms had to determine what portion of price changes in their respective industries reflected a general change in nominal prices (inflation) and what portion reflected a change in real prices for inputs and outputs. Lucas hypothesized that suppliers know their own industries better than the general economy.  Given this imbalance in information, a supplier could perceive a general increase in prices due to inflation as an increase the relative price for its output, reflecting a better, real price for its output and encouraging more production.  The surprise leads to an increase in production and employment throughout the economy.\n\nThe function can be represented simply as:\n\nThe simple version models aggregate output as a function of the price surprise.  A more complicated expression of the Lucas supply curve adds expectations to the model.  Aggregate supply is a function of the “natural” level of output () and the difference between actual prices () and the expected price level given past information  times a coefficient based on an economy's sensitivity to price surprises ():\n\nBy invoking Okun's law to express the function in terms of unemployment, Lucas's supply function can be viewed as an expression of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\n\nSee also \n Lucas islands model\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \n  \n \n\nNew classical macroeconomics", "machine_text": "Lucas Aggregate Supply Function is an economic model developed by Robert Lucas in 1972. It is a macroeconomic model that explains the relationship between the aggregate output and the price level in an economy. This model emphasizes the importance of the expectations and information of individuals in determining how the economy reacts to changes in the price level and aggregate demand. According to the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function, the relationship between the aggregate output and the price level is not always positive. In the short run, there may be a positive relationship between the two, but in the long run, the relationship may be negative. This model is based on the assumption that individuals have rational expectations, which means that they use all available information to make their economic decisions. This means that when the price level changes, individuals will adjust their expectations and behavior accordingly. One of the main contributions of the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function is its explanation of the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The model suggests that in the short run, there may be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This means that a decrease in unemployment may result in an increase in inflation. However, in the long run, there is no such trade-off as the economy moves towards its full employment equilibrium. The Lucas Aggregate Supply Function has been subject to criticism by some economists who argue that it relies heavily on the assumption of rational expectations. They argue that individuals may not always have the necessary information or may not be capable of processing it efficiently. Despite its criticisms, the Lucas Aggregate Supply Function continues to be an important model in macroeconomics. It has contributed significantly to our understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment and the importance of expectations and information in the economy.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 28155219}

To the north the former municipality of Reinberg borders on the Strelasund From the village of Stahlbrode that used to belong to it, there is a car ferry to the island of Rügen (Zudar peninsula).\n\nHistory \nIn 1220 construction began on the church and in 1325 Reinberg was mentioned for the first time in the records.\n\nOn the dissolution of the Principality of Rügen in 1325, the village transferred to the Duchy of Pomerania.\n\nFrom the end of the Thirty Years' War to the year 1815 the region belonged to Swedish Pomerania and thereafter to the Prussian Province of Pomerania.\n\nUntil 1952 Reinberg was part of the district of Grimmen within the Bezirk of Rostock to 1994. Since 1990 it has also bee part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\nOn 7 June 2009 the hitherto independent municipality of Reinsberg merged with those of Behnkendorf, Brandshagen, Horst, Kirchdorf, Miltzow and Wilmshagen to form the new municipality of Sundhagen. The former municipality consists of the villages of Oberhinrichshagen, Falkenhagen, Dömitzow and Stahlbrode.\n\nSights \nAmongst the sights of Reinberg are its Gothic village church, the Sühnestein monument on the cemetery wall that dates to the 15th century and the Reinberg Lime, which was the largest tree in Germany in the 19th century. The age of the tree is around 1,000 years. It is possible that the lime had been planted before the foundation and consecration of the church. Near the tree is the grave of the father of surgeons, Theodor Billroth.\n\nThe Sühnestein (\"Atonement Stone\") has a kneeling figure with hands clasped, next to Christ on the cross. Above the cross, between two roses, are the initials \"J.N.R.J.\" and the words: \"domini miserere mei\". The weathered inscription above the crucified Jesus probably originally ran: \"orate pro ravno van barneko\". It may also be read as \"orate pro heyno van der beken\", however there is no record of a van der Beken family. The princely councillor and  Landvogt, Raven Barnekow, however, was sentenced to death and executed in Stralsund in 1453 as a result of false allegations. This suggests this expiatory cross (Sühnekreuz) was erected in his memory.\n\nReferences \n\nFormer municipalities in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania\nVorpommern-Rügen\nBezirk Rostock", "machine_text": "Reinberg is a historical village located in the southeastern region of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

The earliest known mention of Reinberg dates back to 965 AD, when it was called \"Ryninperge\" in a document. Throughout its history, the village has been inhabited by various Germanic tribes and played an important role in the region's economic and cultural development. Reinberg was a center of mining and agriculture in the Middle Ages, and its location on the famous Romanesque Route attracts many tourists today. The most prominent feature of Reinberg is its impressive castle, which was built in the 12th century and has been renovated several times since then. The castle was the residence of the counts of Hohnstein and was used as a fortification during the Thirty Years' War. Today, it is open to the public and serves as a venue for concerts, exhibitions, and other cultural events. Apart from the castle, Reinberg has several other notable landmarks, such as the St. Andreas Church, which was first mentioned in a document from 1209. The church features Gothic architecture and a beautiful baroque altar. The village also has a historic marketplace, where a weekly farmer's market is held.

The local vineyards cultivate both white and red grapes, and the resulting wines are praised for their unique aroma and flavor. In addition, Reinberg is famous for its sausages, which are made according to a traditional recipe and sold in local shops.

Released in Japan on January 24, 2013, it was published in North America and Europe by NIS America in April 2014. The game takes place thousands of years after the events of its predecessor, Students of the Round, which was created by the same developer. \n\nIn Demon Gaze, the player controls Oz, a young man that possess the power of a magic eye capable of sealing demons. The gameplay is split between venturing into dungeons and spending time at the inn where players can build relationships with non-player characters or spend the money they have earned in the dungeons. A manga adaptation for Demon Gaze illustrated by Kurono began serialisation in Dengeki Maoh in December 2013. An international version of the game was released in Japan as Demon Gaze: Global Edition on July 3, 2014. An enhanced version of the game titled Demon Gaze EXTRA was released in September 2021 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in Japan with a western release set for January 2022.\n\nGameplay\nThe game takes place thousands of years after the events in Students of the Round. Players assume the role of the protagonist Oz, a mysterious young man with the power of a magic eye that grants him the ability to seal demons. The game allows players to create secondary characters that join him on his quest, with seven character classes and five different character races. There are 45 character illustrations altogether, which may be changed by \"taking a bath\". The demons in the game are part machine, and some of them can transform when they go on a rampage. After demons are defeated, the player is able to summon them to battle.\n\nOz journeys into the dungeons of Mislid to kill the demons and gather treasure before returning to town with his loot. Loot can then be used to pay rent at the local Dragon Princess inn or it can be spent to improve the player's party. Although battles take part in dungeons, the game's hub is set in a town where the player can rest and strengthen their party. While at the inn, players can rest or converse with the other non-player characters at the inn, including the manager Fran Pendor, who has a secret mission to offer the player. Certain conversations with non-player characters result in \"heart pounding\" cutscenes. Throughout the game, it is also possible to change the difficulty level, either in certain Dungeon Rooms or by talking with particular characters.\n\nSetting\nDemon Gaze is set in The World of Mythrid, which is divided into 6 regions: the castle of Grimodal, the Old City (Red and Blue), the Slave Graveyard, the Curtain of Star Trees and the Dragon Princess Inn.\n\nDevelopment\nThe game was released in Japan on January 24, 2013. Some of the monsters and items from the prequel, Students of the Round, are included in Demon Gaze, but the game features new dungeons and new half-machine demons as well. The game features many prominent Japanese voice actors including Saori Hayami, Atsuko Tanaka, and Yukari Tamura.\n\nSequel\nDevelopment of a sequel title began in mid-2014.  Demon Gaze II was released in Japan September 29, 2016. A Western release has been announced for, and released in fall 2017 on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4.\n\nReception\n\nDemon Gaze currently holds a score of 70.66% at GameRankings, and 70/100 at Metacritic. Four Famitsu reviewers scored Demon Gaze 9, 9, 8 and 8 out of 10, for a total score of 34/40. The game sold 25,316 physical retail copies within the first week of release in Japan, and retail sales reached 47,993 by mid-February 2013. The game ranked as the sixth most purchased digital Vita game on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2013. By April 2014, it was announced by Kadokawa Games that Demon Gaze shipped 180,000 copies worldwide, including both physical and download copies. A July 2014 announcement by Kadokawa later confirmed a global shipment figure of 200,000 copies.\n\nDale North of Destructoid also gave the game 7/10, claiming Demon Gaze to be \"a solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\" Brittany Vincent of GamesRadar rewarded the game three stars out of five, summarising the game up as \"colorful, brash, and spunky, but it's little more than a wonky journey through dungeon after forgettable dungeon. If it's a grind you're looking for, you can do far better than the mediocrity of becoming a Demon Gazer.\" Heidi Kemps of GameSpot scored the game 7/10, finding the battles, dungeons and characters to be enjoyable, though the story, visual style and the heavy amount of fan service was criticised. Josiah Renaudin of IGN rated the game a 7.2/10, praising the combat and characters, but criticising the uninspired visuals and \"cookie-cutter premise.\" \n\nMarcus Estrada of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it \"a very mechanically sound dungeon crawler,\" and that \"the biggest hurdle to enjoying the game is simply your tastes for (or tolerance of) copious displays of fan service.\" Jim Sterling of The Escapist gave Demon Gaze a more positive review, as well as recommending the game, stating \"this is easily one of the more addictive ones I've enjoyed for a while, and it's perfect on Vita\", and scoring it 4.5/5. Nevertheless, Matt Kamen of The Guardian rated Demon Gaze much lower, giving the game only 2 stars out of 5, as \"Demon Gaze does make nice use of the Vita's online functions, allowing for notes left between players advising of secrets or dangers, but it's not enough to make up for a resoundingly lacklustre package.\"\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Official Japanese website, Archived on December 10, 2012\n Official North American website\n\n2013 video games\nNintendo Switch games\nPlayStation 4 games\nPlayStation Vita games\nKadokawa Shoten games\nKadokawa Dwango franchises\nVideo games developed in Japan\nRole-playing video games\nFantasy video games\nVideo games about demons\nFirst-person party-based dungeon crawler video games", "machine_text": "Demon Gaze is a Japanese dungeon-crawling role-playing game (RPG) developed by Experience Inc. and published by Kadokawa Games.

She was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark in Labour's landslide victory in the 1997 general election.\n\nJones was accused of fraudulently failing to declare the full amount of her election costs, convicted of election fraud in March 1999, and had the Labour whip withdrawn. She was the first MP to be disqualified from membership of the House of Commons for that offence since it was introduced by the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883.  However, the Court of Appeal overturned her conviction within weeks: the disqualification was revoked, and she resumed her place in the House of Commons. However, she lost her seat in the 2001 general election. She later lost a civil case brought against the police for malicious prosecution.\n\nEarly life\nJones was born in Liverpool and grew up in Fazakerley. An only child, her father, Fred Hamilton, was a production manager for a pharmaceutical company, and was a friend of Labour MP Eric Heffer. Heffer gave her a copy of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists when she was young, which inspired her to become an active socialist. She attended Wirral College of Art and Preston College, and joined the Labour Party at the age of 17.\n\nShe became a freelance journalist; her future husband, Christopher Jones, was also a journalist, who worked for the BBC. The couple moved to Lincolnshire. They were married in north Wales in 1982. They had two sons; Penri and Huw.\n\nPolitical career\nJones was elected as a Labour member of West Lindsey District Council, gaining Gainsborough South West ward from the Liberal Democrats in 1990. She served a single term and did not seek re-election in 1994. She was unsuccessful as the Labour Parliamentary candidate in the Conservative stronghold of Gainsborough and Horncastle in the 1992 general election, finishing in third place, and then failed to secure the nomination to fight for the marginal seat of Lincoln and the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Riverside.\n\nIn September 1995, she was selected to fight at Newark. Although she presented herself at the selection meetings as a traditional socialist, she was nevertheless a New Labour professional.  After her selection, she presented her New Labour sympathies, much to the consternation of a number of local party activists who had supported her nomination.\n\nShe was elected as Member of Parliament for Newark-on-Trent in the 1997 general election, ousting Conservative MP Richard Alexander, who had held the seat since the 1979 general election. She was pictured alongside 96 other women Labour MPs in the \"Blair babes\" photograph, and seen next to Tony Blair himself.\n\nHowever, the press labelled her the \"parliamentary virgin\", as she was the last of the 242 new MPs to make their maiden speech in the Commons. \"Having endured through gritted teeth being dubbed a 'Blair's babe', I am grateful at least to have the opportunity to relinquish for ever the title of being the last virgin in the House,\" she announced upon making the speech in January 1998. A Roman Catholic, Jones campaigned against abortion, and she appeared with Lord Longford at a Labour conference fringe meeting.\n\nAfter complaints by the Liberal Democrats, the police launched an investigation into her spending at the 1997 election campaign. Although submitting election expenses within the permitted maximum, she was charged with her agent Des Whicher with having fraudulently omitted to declare spending which would have taken her well over it. Although most of the charges collapsed and were withdrawn by the trial Judge, a dispute over whether the rent for a campaign office used also as party headquarters was left to the Jury. The two were convicted on 19 March 1999 of \"corrupt practices\", under section 82(6) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and she was sentenced to 100 hours' community service. Prominent members of the local Labour Party gave evidence against her, and much was made at the time of her rivals for the Labour Party candidacy.  At the selection meeting of the Newark Branch Labour Party, the local candidate came in a poor fourth, and withdrew from the contest at that stage. The runner up, Nick Palmer went on to win the Labour Party candidacy for the Broxtowe constituency. As a result of the conviction, Jones was disqualified from the House of Commons.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions on 15 April 1999.\n\nThe Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division held that the effect of the quashing of the conviction was that the disqualification was revoked with no need for a by-election, and she resumed her seat on 29 April.\n\nShe contested her seat in the 2001 general election, but lost to the Conservative candidate Patrick Mercer. In the 12 months before the 2001 general election, the local newspaper, The Newark Advertiser restricted reporting of her routine activities after she unsuccessfully demanded that every report concerning her should be submitted for her approval before publication; the newspaper lifted the restriction during the campaign.\n\nLater life\nAfter studying law at the University of Lincoln, Jones brought a civil case against Nottinghamshire Police for malicious prosecution.  The case was dismissed in December 2005, leaving her to bear costs of £45,000. In an interview, she claimed that a government minister had asked her for sex in return for assisting her to secure promotion.\n\nDeath\nJones reportedly became reliant on alcohol after she was shunned by her colleagues when she returned to the House of Commons in 1999 - only 34 signed an early day motion welcoming her back to the House of Commons after her conviction was quashed. Her husband said that she refused to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in case she was recognised.\n\nShe was found dead at her home in Saxilby by her husband, reportedly surrounded by 15 empty vodka bottles. Her cause of death was reported as alcoholism or alcoholic liver disease.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n The \"Fiona Jones archive\" in the Newark Advertiser.\n\n1957 births\n2007 deaths\nCouncillors in Lincolnshire\nEnglish Roman Catholics\nLabour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nPeople from West Lindsey District\nPoliticians from Liverpool\nFemale members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies\nUK MPs 1997–2001\n20th-century British women politicians\n21st-century British women politicians\nAlumni of the University of Lincoln\n20th-century English women\n20th-century English people\n21st-century English women\n21st-century English people\nWomen councillors in England", "machine_text": "Fiona Jones is a British politician and former Member of Parliament (MP), known for her work in promoting the rights of women and the LGBT community.

He was a minister in the government of Sir James Mitchell.\n\nEarly life\nLindsay was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Sarah (née Gillies) and William Lindsay. He arrived in Western Australia as a young man, having earlier spent two years in Queensland. During the Boer War, Lindsay served two tours of duty with a Western Australian regiment. He was refused permission to re-enlist after his first tour of duty, but supposedly stowed away on a troop ship and talked his way into continuing to serve. After the war's end, Lindsay did not return to Australia until 1905, when he took up land at Wyalkatchem as one of the region's first settlers. He was elected to the Dowerin Road Board in 1912, and then switched to the Wyalkatchem Road Board upon its creation in 1920.\n\nPolitics and later life\nLindsay entered parliament at the 1924 state election, winning the seat of Toodyay from the sitting Country member, Alfred Piesse. He and Piesse belonged to separate factions of the party, which had split in 1923 due to disputes over the coalition with the Nationalist Party. Lindsay was re-elected to Toodyay with an increased majority at the 1927 election. He switched to the new seat of Mount Marshall at the 1930 election, which saw a victory for the Nationalist–Country coalition, and was subsequently appointed to cabinet as Minister for Public Works and Minister for Labour.\n\nAt the 1933 state election, both Lindsay and the Mitchell government were defeated. He was one of four government ministers to lose their seats (along with Mitchell, John Scaddan, and Hubert Parker), although his defeat was to an \"Independent Country\" candidate, Frederick Warner. Lindsay stood for East Province at the 1936 Legislative Council election, but was defeated by Garnet Wood. He made one final run for parliament at the 1943 state election, but lost to Hugh Leslie.

Following the opening in Azerbaijan, Arshin Mal Alan was performed in theatres of Tbilisi, Yerevan and Ashgabat, as well as Iran and Turkey.\n\nSynopsis\nThe plot is centered on a bachelor named Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. However, in the 19th century, women were kept at home and, when allowed out in public, they were heavily covered in hijab. Asker's friend, Suleyman, suggests that he disguise himself as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to visit houses, selling fabrics.\n\nAsker meets a woman called Gulchohra and they fall in love, even though Asker's actual identity remains unknown to Gulchohra. Asker reveals his identity to Gulchohra's father, the wealthy Sultan Bey, and asks for permission to marry. Sultan Bey agrees, but Gulchohra objects because she loves the peddler.

While they look at the goods, Asker looks at them. He sees Gulchohra, and falls in love. Gulchohra is also charmed by the arshin malchy. When the women leave, Asker makes a declaration of love.\n\nAunt Jahan goes to Sultan Bey, as a matchmaker, at her nephew’s request. Bey is glad to meet such a charming widow and makes a proposal of marriage to her. Asker agrees to give his aunt away in marriage to Sultan Bey but, in return, he wants to marry Gulchohra. The sultan is outraged at the idea of giving his daughter away to an arshin malchy. Sultan Bey furiously turns them out of the house.\n\nThird act\nSuleyman Bey visits Sultan Bey, and proposes wealthy Asker as a husband to Gulchohra. Sultan Bey agrees with joy. While at Sultan Bey’s house, Suleyman Bey meets, and falls in love with, Asia, Sultan Bey’s niece.

Asker comes in at the last moment and explains everything to Gulchohre, and she is very happy. Only Sultan Bey, knowing that they deceived him, becomes angry.

He is remembered for his works on the subject of heraldry, which are generally considered to be some of the most complete and authoritative ever produced in the British Isles.\n\nLife\nNisbet was born in Edinburgh, the third of ten children of Adam Nisbet WS and his wife Janet, only daughter of Alexander Aikenhead WS. Adam, and later Alexander, were chiefs of the ancient Nisbet family, of Nisbet in Berwickshire; however, the family had recently lost much of their wealth due to their zealous support of King Charles in the civil war, and had been forced to sell their ancestral estate. In his Essay on Additional Figures and Marks of Cadency, Nisbet remarks that he \"had a very early inclination to the study of herauldry, and when a boy ... looked on its figures with wonder, and often wish'd to know their names and signification.\"\n\nNisbet matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1675, where he studied philosophy. After graduating in 1682, he was employed as a solicitor for a number of years before giving it up in order to devote his full-time to his historical and heraldic studies. He later became a teacher, instructing various members of the nobility, including the Earl of Carnwrath.\n\nAround the turn of the 18th century he set out to create a comprehensive treatise on heraldry. He initially intended to obtain funding via subscription, but finding that this would not produce enough money, he appealed to the Scottish Parliament for help. Though they promised him £248 6s 8d, this was never delivered, and the passing of the Act of Union put paid to any chance of further parliamentary assistance. Nisbet's System of Heraldry was finally published in 1722, over twenty years after he had first set out to write the work. He died three years later, likely in poverty, and was buried close to the Nisbet Tomb in Greyfriars Kirk, though the exact location is now lost. His contemporary George Crawford wrote of him: \"he was a worthy, modest gentleman, who had as many friends and as few enemies as any man I have known.\" In 1934 his kinsman Robert Chancellor Nesbitt arranged for John Buchan to unveil a memorial plaque in Greyfriars, which can still be seen today.\n\nNisbet never married, and as such, the linear line of the Nisbets of that Ilk ended upon his death.

He was later removed from his post for refusing to sign the \"Public Resolutions,\" a document which held that the civil authorities had power over the church. In 1653, Nisbet was appointed as minister of the parish of Orwell, Kinross-shire, where he served until his death.

While serving on the frontier, Wagner saw action during campaigns against the Sioux and Nez Perce from 1876 until 1877, and the Utes in 1881. Entering military education while assigned as a professor of military science and tactics at the Louisiana State University and East Florida Seminary, Wagner would win high praise from the Military Service Institution of the United States, and greatly increased his prominence as one of the leading military scholars, for his monograph The Military Necessities of the United States, and the Best Method of Meeting Them in 1884.\n\nFollowing his transfer to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas the next year, Wagner accepted a personal request by the commandant of the United States Infantry and Cavalry School to be an assistant instructor of tactics and the military arts. During this time, as the Infantry and Cavalry School became an official military training school with the establishment of regulations and training programs in 1888, Wagner would author several important military textbooks including The Campaign of Koniggratz (1889) and Organization and Tactics (1895).\n\nPromoted to captain in 1892, Wagner was named head of the Military Arts Department two years later.

Campaigned exclusively in California, he was lightly raced in his early career, running twice a two-year-old in 2011 and once in the following year. As a four-year-old in 2013 he began by racing against moderate opposition before emerging as one of the best sprinters in North America with Grade I victories in the Bing Crosby Stakes and the Santa Anita Sprint Championship.  Preparing for the Breeders' Cup, he fractured his leg during a workout and was euthanized.  At the end of the year, he was posthumously named American Champion Sprint Horse.\n\nBackground\nPoints Offthebench was a lightly made dark bay or brown gelding with a white star bred in California by Gary Rocks. He was sired by Benchmark, a multiple graded stakes winner who had previously sired the Grade I winners Brother Derek (Santa Anita Derby) and Idiot Proof (Ancient Title Stakes). Points Offthebench is the second foal of the unraced mare Mo Chuisle: her first foal, Bench Points, won five races including the Grade III Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes. During his racing career, Points Offthebench was owned by Donnie Crievier and Charles V. Martin and trained by Tim Yakteen. He was considered a major contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint but was fatally injured in a training accident at Santa Anita Park on October 26. Three months later, he was named American Champion Sprint Horse for 2013.\n\nRacing career\n\n2011: two-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench made two appearances as a two-year-old, both of them on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack in August. He began in a five and a half furlong maiden race in which he started at odds of 4.1/1 and finished third of eight runners. Eighteen days later he appeared in a similar event over six furlongs in which he was ridden, as on his debut, by the Mexican jockey Alonso Quinonez. Starting the 2.4/1 second favorite, he raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths.\n\n2012: three-year-old season\nPoints Offthebench began his second season in a six-and-a-half-furlong Optional claiming race on the dirt at Santa Anita Park on February 17. Ridden by Joel Rosario, he tracked the odds-on favorite, Three Vases, before taking the lead on the final turn and drawing away in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths. He did not race again in 2012.\n\n2013: four-year-old season\nAlmost a year after his last race, Points Offthebench returned in a six-furlong claiming race at Santa Anita in which he finished second by half a length to the favored Italian Rules. In April, he was ridden by Tyler Baze in another claimer over six and a half furlongs at the same track and started second favorite at odds of 2.2/1 in a field of ten runners. He raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and holding off the challenge of the favorite, Oliver's Tale, to win by half a length. The gelding remained in claiming company for his next race over six furlongs at Hollywood Park Racetrack on May 27. Ridden again by Baze, he took the lead in the straight and went clear in the closing stages to win by two and a quarter lengths from Cyclometer, with the favored Italian Rules a neck away in third.\n\nPoints Offthebench was then moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Bing Crosby Stakes over six furlongs at Del Mar on July 28 in which he was ridden for the first time by Mike Smith. The gelding was fourth choice in the betting for the race behind previous Grade I winners Goldencents (Santa Anita Derby), Jimmy Creed (Malibu Stakes), and Comma to the Top (CashCall Futurity). Points Offthebench tracked the leaders before moving up on the outside to take the lead entering the straight. In the closing stages, he was challenged by Goldencents but prevailed by a head, with a gap of over three lengths back to Jimmy Creed in third. Tim Yakteen, who recorded the first Grade I success of his eight-year training career, commented: \"He was training great, we drew a great post and he was ready for the task, so I felt confident going into the race. He ran huge and Mike gave him a great ride.\"\n\nOn October 5 at Santa Anita, Points Offthebench met Goldencents again in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship (formerly the Ancient Title Stakes) in a field which also included Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Trinniberg. Ridden again by Smith, the gelding moved up on the outside on the turn before overtaking the leader Distinctiv Passion in the final furlong. Despite lugging towards the inside in the closing stages, he held on to win by half a length from Goldencents. After the race, Smith commented: \"He has some turn of foot, and I hit the front too soon, but he still held on. He pulled up nice and happy, well within himself. He's a very talented horse.\"\n\nAfter four consecutive wins, including two at Grade I level, Points Offthebench was considered a leading contender for the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Santa Anita on November. In a routine four-furlong workout at the track on October 26, the gelding was approaching the sixteenth pole when he broke down on his right foreleg with what was described as \"an inordinately loud, sickening sound\". He had sustained a condlyar fracture to his right foreleg and was euthanized within fifteen minutes. His owner, Charles Martin, said, \"He's been a tremendous horse. He was the nicest horse you would ever find... He was as much a pet as an awesome racehorse... everyone in the barn is devastated\".\n\nAssessment and honors\nOn January 18, 2014, almost three month after his death, Points Offthebench was named American Champion Sprint Horse at the Eclipse Awards, taking 125 of the 249 votes. He was the first horse to be posthumously awarded an Eclipse Award since Left Bank in 2002. In the 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Points Offthebench was given a rating of 117, making him the highest-rated sprinter competing on dirt.\n\nPedigree\n\nReferences\n\n2009 racehorse births\n2013 racehorse deaths\nRacehorses bred in California\nRacehorses trained in the United States\nThoroughbred family 9-c\nEclipse Award winners", "machine_text": "Points Offthebench was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who competed from 2011 to 2014.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"St. Mary's Church (Dedham, Massachusetts)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "St. Mary of the Assumption Church (commonly referred to as St. Mary's) is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church in Dedham, Massachusetts, in the Archdiocese of Boston.\n\nThe first church was constructed in Dedham Centre in 1857 and it was formally established as a parish in 1866. In 1880 the parish built a larger church on High Street, towards East Dedham. The laying of the cornerstone for this \"cathedral in the wilderness\" attracted more than 4,000 people, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood. The new church would not be completed until 1900, and was dedicated by Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate. Today the church hosts one of the largest Life Teen programs in the country.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nThe history of Catholicism in Dedham begins in 1758, only 120 years after the settlement of the Contentment Plantation and fully two decades before the American Revolution. During the French and Indian War the British expelled over 11,000 Acadians from what is today Nova Scotia.  Eleven of them resettled in Dedham, and though the town and the Massachusetts Bay colony were both officially Congregationalist, they were allowed to reside here as French neutrals until they returned to Canada in 1760.\n\nAfter the Acadians returned to Canada in 1760, Dedham would not see another Catholic resident for decades. The first Catholic who spent any length of time in Dedham was Mr. Gill, who lived in what is today known as Riverdale, but was then called Dedham Island. The few Catholics who lived in Dedham would have to travel 16 miles to St. Joseph's in Roxbury, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Franklin Street in Boston, or to St. Mary's in Waltham to attend Mass.\n\nBy the early 1800s a few Catholics had settled in Dedham. The first Mass in Dedham was celebrated in Sunday, May 15, 1843, in the home of Daniel Slattery, with eight Catholics present. An altar was set up by the window. For the next three years Slattery's 17-year-old brother-in-law would bring Father James Strain from Waltham and back each Sunday to minister to the needs of the small congregation.\n\nBy 1846, the Catholic community in Dedham was well established enough that the town became part of the mission of St. Joseph's Church in Roxbury. The flood of Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine necessitated holding Mass in the Temperance Hall, often by Father Patrick O'Beirne. Mass was also occasionally celebrated in the Crystal Palace on Washington Street. Worshipers came from Dedham, South Dedham, West Dedham, and West Roxbury.\n\nFirst Church\n\nThe number and devotion of the first parishioners permitted a church to be constructed within 10 years. In 1856 the cornerstone was laid and, in 1857, the first St. Mary's Church was completed on Washington Street between Spruce and Marion Streets. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 1857, Father O'Beirne said Mass for the first time in a new church that could seat 600.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Father Johnson was publicly raising the issue of discrimination against Catholics in the public schools. In 1885, as a member of the School Committee, he claimed the principal of the Avery School ridiculed Catholic students, and several years later had a lengthy debate with a Protestant minister via letters in the Dedham Standard about the \"rank misrepresentation of the Catholic Church\" in a history book adopted by the School Committee.\n\nIn 1890 there were an estimated 2,000 parishioners, including 957 Irish, 250 English-speaking Canadians, 58 French, 19 Italians and 1 Portuguese. There were 400 students in the Sunday School classes in 1884.\n\nChurch construction\nIn February 1880, it was announced that a Protestant who had business in Boston had paid off the parish's $700 debt, allowing the congregation to commence work on a new building. The cornerstone of the present church was laid at 3:00 on October 17, 1880 by Archbishop John Williams. A crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood to accommodate all those who wished to attend. It was one of the largest gatherings in Dedham's history.\n\nThe footprint of the Gothic church, which Father Johnson said was to be a \"cathedral in the wilderness,\" measures 150' long by 65' wide, and the bell tower is 164' tall. The apex of the ceiling is 80' and it has the longest aisle in the Archdiocese of Boston. It was at the time, and remains today, \"the largest and most imposing church in the town\" and \"one of the most conspicuous edifices\" in the town.\n\nThe interior walls were plastered by William B. Gould, an escaped slave who settled in Dedham. While the upper church was still under construction, the lower church was used for Mass and the upper portion for various fairs and other gatherings. The first mass was said in the lower church on October 24, 1886. The crowd was overflowing, and included 20 Protestants, many of local importance, and a choir from St. Peter's in South Boston.\n\nAfter 20 years of working, praying, and fundraising from the meager immigrant wages of many of the parishioners, the Upper Church was finally completed. It took so long that another architect had to take over but was, Father Fleming said, “almost too beautiful for ordinary use.”\n\nThe upper church was completed and dedicated by Archbishop Williams on September 9, 1900. In addition to Williams, Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the papal delegate to the United States, attended, as did Bishop Denis Mary Bradley of New Hampshire. The crowd, numbered at 1,200, included the communion class and many prominent citizens of the Town, including Protestants. The dedication packed the church, requiring many to stand, and tickets were required to enter.\n\nAlbert Nickerson, a member of Dedham's St. Paul's Episcopal Church, donated $10,000 towards the effort. The Dedham Granite for the outer walls was donated by another Protestant, John Bullard. The granite came from Bullard's own lot.\n\n20th century\nIn June 1890, Father John H. Fleming arrived at St. Mary's and began a 33-year tenure as pastor. During his pastorate the parish the upper church would be completed, the parish cemetery in West Roxbury would be purchased, and the old wooden rectory next to the church would be torn down so a new rectory could be built of Dedham Granite in 1913. On Sundays, however, the quality of his preaching was such that other priests would come to St. Mary's to listen.\n\nIn the 1920s, with the building work completed, new pastor Father Henry A. Walsh was able to focus on the various groups and societies within the parish. The Catholic population in the area grew, as did the amount of social activity within the parish. By 1936, the parish was one of the largest in the Archdiocese of Boston with 6,000 parishioners, four priests, and six nuns. The Sunday School alone had over 1,300 pupils. Within months of arriving as pastor in 1929, Father George P. O'Connor began a parish school with three Sisters of St. Joseph. He also began a Catholic Youth Organization, and was generally regarded as having a focus on youth.\n\nModern history\nIn the 1960s, St. Mary's remained one of the largest parishes in the archdiocese. As it was too much work for one pastor and three assistant priests, a second parish was established for the Riverdale neighborhood, St. Susana's, in 1962. As the school was also growing, a new convent was constructed in 1964.\n\nThe number of people attending Mass each week began to drop off rather dramatically in the early 1990s. In 1989, the average weekly attendance was 2,843 people. By 1995, however, it dropped to just 1,030. The following year, 1996, Father (later bishop) John Anthony Dooher and Father Chris Hickey arrived at St. Mary's within weeks of each other. Mass attendance increased by 50% that year alone, and in 1997 it was over 2,500. In September 1997, Hickey and youth minister Seán Flynn began a Life Teen program to minister to high school students.\n\nParish\n\nIn 2006, the parish served 2,329 families, and in 2015 it sponsored 38 ministries in six categories: prayer, liturgical, social, outreach, health and wellness, and parishioner sponsored.\n\nLife Teen\nOne of the largest ministries in St. Mary's today in its Life Teen program, which ministers to high school aged youth. It was founded in September 1997 by Fr. Chris Hickey, then-pastor John Dooher, and youth minister Seán Flynn.\n\nThe teens' \"enthusiasm for church has brought a special vibrancy\" to the parish. A Life Teen mass is offered on Sunday evenings and features a live band, and is then followed by social and catechitical sessions known as Life Nights. Participants have their own prayer night, perform community service, and gather to socialize in their clubhouse.\n\nConvent and parish office\nBehind the church on Avery Street is the Parish Office. It was previously a convent that housed the nuns who taught in the parish school. The stained glass windows in the building were done by Chartrand.\n\nCemetery\nIn 1880, the Town of Dedham set aside a portion of Brookdale Cemetery, just a block away from St. Mary's, for Catholics to be buried. Under the pastorate of Fr. John H. Fleming (1890-1923), the parish purchased its own cemetery just over the border in West Roxbury. It still operates the cemetery on Grove Street today.\n\n150th anniversary\nIn 2016 the parish celebrated its 150th anniversary with a year long celebration. Included in this was a mass on October 2 celebrated by Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley. Other events included a healing mass and an organ concert.\n\nVocations\nTwo LifeTeen alumni, Will Sexton and Mike Zimmerman, were ordained priests. Sexton and Zimmerman were both teens in the program, and were ordained alongside Kevin Leaver, who was a CORE member. Together the three made up 50% of those being ordained at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in 2017. As of 2017, two other alumni and one former CORE member are seminarians for the Archdiocese of Boston, and one alumnus joined the Carmelites. From 2003 to 2018, the parish sent 15 men to the seminary.\n\nNotes and citations\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\n\nSt. Mary's LifeTeen\n\nAcadian diaspora\nFrench-Canadian culture in Massachusetts\nHistory of Dedham, Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic churches in Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic parishes of Archdiocese of Boston\nReligious organizations established in 1866\n1866 establishments in Massachusetts\nRoman Catholic churches completed in 1900\nChurches in Dedham, Massachusetts\nStone churches in Massachusetts\n20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States", "machine_text": "St. Mary's Church is a historic Catholic church located in Dedham, Massachusetts.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Battle of Ortenbach\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Battle of Ortenbach, also known as the Battle of Gengenbach, took place on 23 July 1678 during the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War, in the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It featured a French army commanded by François de Créquy and an Imperial force under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. \n\nWhile in reality a skirmish, rather than a battle, Ortenbach was part of a series of events that enabled the French to secure Alsace and capture both Kehl and the crossing over the Rhine near the Imperial city of Strasbourg. The war ended in January 1679 when France and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Nijmegen; Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté, before the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden forced them to relinquish most of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what Louis XIV viewed as Dutch ingratitude for previous French support, in May 1672 French forces invaded the Dutch Republic. \n\nThey initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they received support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and the Spanish Empire. This was formalised by the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, which opened a new front in the Rhineland; despite being outnumbered, poor co-ordination between the Imperial armies and the skill of Turenne's skill allowed the French to retain the vital territory of Alsace. \n\nTurenne's death at Salzbach in 1675 forced the French onto the defensive and in September 1676, the Imperialists regained Philippsburg and control of the Rhine crossing at Strasbourg. During 1677, the new French commander de Créquy prevented them invading Alsace by astute manoeuvring; he won a minor battle at Kochersberg in October and then captured Freiburg im Breisgau. \n\nWith peace negotiations nearing completion at Nijmegen, Louis planned a rapid campaign in March and April 1678 to strengthen his position in the Spanish Netherlands, remaining on the defensive elsewhere. De Créquy was instructed not to seek battle and ensure the retention of Freiburg; despite his successful defence of Alsace, Louis had limited confidence in him due to his defeat at Konzer Brücke in 1675 and subsequent loss of Trier. While an apparently minor defeat, it clearly rankled, since it was specifically mentioned in the eulogy delivered at Louis' funeral in 1715.  \n\nIn the spring of 1678, de Créquy concentrated his forces at Scherwiller, where he was reinforced by the Army of the Moselle under Schomberg. Charles of Lorraine began assembling an army of 30,000 outside Offenburg, intending to re-capture Freiburg and in late June, de Créquy sought to divert him by moving against Rheinfelden, now in Switzerland. Charles despatched Starhemberg and 7,000 men to its relief but the French caught them crossing the river, inflicting 3,000 casualties, many drowned, and taking 800 prisoners. After this success, Louis gave de Créquy permission to attack the main Imperial force, if he saw an opportunity to do so.\n\nThe battle\n\n \nThroughout the war, the logistics support designed by Louvois allowed French armies to move faster and open campaigns much earlier, even during the winter, when armies traditionally halted operations due to lack of forage for cavalry and transport. This was enhanced by a systematic policy of denying supplies to the enemy through blockades and the destruction of towns, villages and farms.\n\nTheir comparative advantage was particularly marked in the Rhineland, due to the weakness of the Imperial system and their armies' dependence on proximity to the Rhine for resupply. In May 1677, the English envoy in Vienna reported Charles of Lorraine was short of ammunition and his troops unable to survive more than three days away from the river. \n\nIn the 1677 campaign, the Imperialists sustained severe losses from disease and hunger due to the strain placed on their supply lines by constant marching and counter-marching; Freiburg was captured in November because they were incapable of defending it. De Créquy now repeated this strategy; leaving Choiseul at Rheinfelden to reduce the remaining Imperial strongpoints and burn down Bad Säckingen, he returned to Bad Krozingen, 15 kilometres south-west of Freiburg. By mid July, most of the Imperial army was spread out between the villages of Gengenbach and Lahr, with forward elements at Denzlingen (see Map).\n\nAs in the previous year, the Imperial army began to disintegrate due to disease and desertion forcing Charles to withdraw behind the Kinzig, a tributary of the Rhine providing a natural defence barrier in front of Offenburg. On 23 July, the French attempted to cross it but were prevented from doing so by the Imperial cavalry; this is the encounter known as the Battle of Ortenbach. Charles refused to commit his forces to a general engagement and retreated to Oberkirch but at the price of being cut off from the Rhine; on 27 July, de Créquy captured Kehl, its bridge over the Rhine and the associated fort of Etoile. \n \nBoth the Dutch Republic and Spain had ended the war by mid-August but Emperor Leopold continued to delay in the hope of regaining some of his losses. Charles crossed back onto the left back of the Rhine at Philippsburg but found de Créquy once again blocking his advance. In late September, he admitted defeat and withdrew to the Electoral Palatinate, which ended the campaign.\n\nAftermath\n\nIn the January 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, France retained Kehl and Freiburg-im-Breisgau; Emperor Leopold then further damaged relationships with his German allies by unsuccessfully demanding he be granted the Free Imperial Cities of Gengenbach, Zell-am-Harmersbach and Offenburg as 'compensation.'\n\nAs the entry point into Alsace, Louis decided Strasbourg had to be annexed; de Créquy's 1678 campaign allowed him to blockade the city if needed and on 30 September 1681, French troops occupied the city. French possession of Strasbourg was confirmed by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick but in return they withdrew from territories on the right bank of the Rhine, including Kehl and Freiburg.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n ;\n \n\nConflicts in 1678\nOrtenbach\nOrtenbach\n1678 in France\nBattle of Ortenbach\nOrtenbach", "machine_text": "The Battle of Ortenbach was fought on 22 December 1431, near the village of Ortenbach, in present-day Germany, during the Hussite Wars, between the Hussite army commanded by Jan Roháč z Dubé and the Imperial army commanded by Count John of Renchen. The Hussites, who were followers of Jan Hus and had fought against the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire for religious and political freedoms, were well-known for their use of wagon fortifications, which they used to protect themselves and their families during their marches and battles. In this battle, Roháč strategically chose to place his wagons in a circle, forming a strong defensive position. The Imperial army, consisting of knights and mercenaries, attempted to break through the Hussite wagon fortifications with cavalry charges, but were met with a rain of arrows and gunfire. Count John's forces suffered significant casualties, and the Hussites emerged victorious. The battle was a significant turning point in the Hussite Wars, as it marked the first time that the Hussites had successfully defended a wagon fortification against a superior force. The victory at Ortenbach gave the Hussites a much-needed boost in morale and led to a series of successful campaigns against the Imperial army. The Battle of Ortenbach is also notable for the role played by Jan Roháč z Dubé. Roháč, a renowned and skilled tactician, was a key figure in the Hussite army and played a crucial role in many of their victories. Today, a memorial stone stands at the site of the battle, commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought and died on both sides.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screen direction\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In film editing, video editing and post production, screen direction is the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on the screen from the point of view of the camera or audience. A rule of film editing and film grammar is that movement from one edited shot to another must maintain the consistency of screen direction in order to avoid audience confusion.\n\n\"Camera left\" or \"frame left\" indicates movement towards the left side of the screen, while \"camera right\" or \"frame right\" refers to movement towards the right side of the screen.  \"Foreground\" refers to the apparent space close to the camera (and thus to the audience), and \"background\" refers to the apparent space in the distance away from the camera and the audience.\n\nAs an example of screen direction in use, if an actor is shown in one shot walking from screen left to screen right and then is shown in the next shot to be moving in the opposite direction (screen right to screen left), the audience will assume that the actor has changed direction and is walking back to where he started (in the absence of obvious contextual or environmental cues).\n\nIf the shot shows him again moving from screen left to screen right (as in the first shot), the audience will assume that the actor is continuing his previous movement and extending it to apparently cover a greater distance even if that is purely a fabrication of editing.\n\nAnother example would be if two characters are shown in a medium shot, say from the waist up, looking at each other, it is generally established that one is on the left of screen and the other on the right. The one on the left looks right to the other character and vice versa. When the editor cuts to a close shot of a person, it would be disorienting if the character looked the other way. The audience would assume that the character is looking at something else.\n\nIn the coverage of the scene, it is customary in film technique to be sure that screen direction is maintained. In a close up, the environmental cues are at a minimum.  \n\nIt is the responsibility of the director, cameraman, and script supervisor on the set to maintain consistency of screen direction so that later during editing, the myriad short pieces of film can be properly assembled by the editor into a coherent film that tells the story intended.\n\nAvant-garde, experimental, and some independent film and video productions often deliberately violate screen direction rules in order to create audience disorientation or ambiguity. However, unless it is done very skillfully, violation of screen direction can appear to the audience to be the result of filmmaker ineptitude rather than experimentation.\n\nCinematic techniques", "machine_text": "Screen direction, also referred to as scene direction, is an aspect of filmmaking that determines how characters and objects move within the frame of a shot. It refers to the direction in which the action is taking place, as observed by the camera and the audience. In filmmaking, the screen is typically divided into two halves - the left and the right. The movement of characters and objects between the two halves is known as crossing the line, or the 180-degree rule. The 180-degree rule is a fundamental principle of screen direction that filmmakers abide by to prevent visual confusion for the audience, ensuring continuity and coherence throughout a film. The 180-degree rule states that the camera should always remain on one side of an axis, an imaginary line running through the main subjects of a shot, to preserve the spatial orientation of the characters and their relationships within the frame. Violating this rule can cause confusion, disorientation, and distract from the story being told. Screen direction also helps to convey the emotional intensity of a scene. For example, a character moving towards the camera can convey aggression or confrontation, while a character moving away from the camera can indicate fear, submission, or escape. In addition to its practical applications, screen direction also plays a crucial role in the overall artistry of a film. A director can use screen direction to convey the tone and mood of a scene, and to establish character relationships. In conclusion, while screen direction might seem like a technical aspect of filmmaking, it is essential to the seamless telling of a story through film. It contributes to the overall coherence and clarity of a film, and helps to create a world and characters that are both believable and engaging to audiences.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 3337102}

In English it is sometimes known as the  common funnel.\n\nNaming\nThis species was originally described by the mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Agaricus gibbus, at a time when gilled mushrooms were generally all assigned to genus Agaricus.  Then in 1871 in his guide to mycology (\"Der Führer in die Pilzkunde\"),  Paul Kummer allocated the species to the genus Clitocybe, which previously (according to the system of Fries) had only been a tribe within genus Agaricus.\n\nIn 2003 Harri Harmaja created the new genus Infundibulicybe for some of the larger members of the former Clitocybe and he included Infundibulicybe gibba as the type species.  A couple of authorities still keep it in genus Clitocybe, however.\n\nThe older name Clitocybe infundibuliformis is often identified as a synonym of I. gibba, but according to Species Fungorum that use was incorrect and the original C. infundibuliformis was a different mushroom.\n\nThe epithet gibba comes from the Latin adjective \"gibbus\", meaning \"humped\" or \"gibbous\".  The name infundibuliformis derives from the Latin \"infundibulum\", a funnel, with the suffix \"-formis\" - so it means \"funnel-shaped\".\n\nDescription\nThis section uses the given references throughout.\n\nThe matt slightly felted cap grows from about 3 cm to 9 cm, and is beige to tan, also sometimes with a pink tinge. It soon becomes funnel-shaped but often has a small bulge (an \"umbo\") in the centre.\nThere is no ring or other veil remnant. The stem is white or whitish and about 2–8 cm long and 1 cm in diameter.\nThe white gills are crowded and very decurrent (running down the stem).\nIt has a faint \"cyanic\" smell, like new-mown hay, and the taste is mild.  However, there is also a central European variety \"adstringens\" which has an unpleasant taste.\nThe tear-shaped spores are white and around 5.5–8 µm by 4–5 µm.\n\nDistribution, habitat, ecology and human impact\nThis gregarious saprobic mushroom grows on soil in deciduous or (less commonly) coniferous woods and may be found from summer to autumn.  It sometimes forms fairy rings.\n\nIt is very common throughout Europe, and occurs in North America and Japan.\n\nIt is edible when young, but said to be of mediocre quality. It can be fried or used in risottos or soups etc. The stems are tough and may be discarded. The species resembles some which are poisonous.\n\nAn extract of I. gibba exhibits inhibitory activity on thrombin.\n\nSimilar species\nThe species resembles Infundibulicybe squamulosa and Pseudoclitocybe cyathiformis.\n\nReferences\n\nTricholomataceae\nEdible fungi\nFungi described in 1801\nFungi of Europe\nTaxa named by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon", "machine_text": "Infundibulicybe gibba, commonly known as the snow cap mushroom, is a species of mushroom belonging to the family Strophariaceae. It is a small, saprotrophic mushroom that grows on the ground in deciduous and coniferous forests, often in dense clusters. The cap of Infundibulicybe gibba is bell-shaped, with a diameter of 5-15 mm. The cap is initially white, but turns greyish-brown with age. The stem is slender and cylindrical, measuring 5-20mm in length and 1-2mm in thickness. Its colour is typically a pale grey or white and covered with fine white hairs. The underside of the cap features gills with a light to dark brown colour, ultimately turning dark brown or nearly black as the mushroom matures. Infundibulicybe gibba is found throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. In North America, it is typically found in colder regions such as Canada and Alaska. It is known to grow on wet soils in late fall to early winter. Infundibulicybe gibba is generally considered non-toxic but not typically harvested for consumption due to its small size and lack of true taste. It is not known for any medicinal properties, however, there is interest in field research on the species' ability to break down plant matter to extract nutrients. Recent studies have found that Infundibulicybe gibba may be useful in reducing the occurrence of plant pathogenic diseases. Specifically, the fungus appears to be able to reduce the incidence of root rot in pine seedlings. In conclusion, Infundibulicybe gibba is an interesting species of mushroom that can be found throughout northern regions in Asia, Europe, and North America.

The album showcased Pablo's pioneering style of dub reggae and helped to establish him as a major figure in the development of Jamaican music. Augustus Pablo, born Horace Swaby in Kingston, Jamaica in 1954, began his musical career as a session musician and producer in the late 1960s. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and innovative musician, playing melodica, keyboards, and other instruments. Pablo's distinctive sound was characterized by the use of echo and reverb, which he used to create a haunting and ethereal atmosphere. This Is Augustus Pablo features some of Pablo's most iconic tracks, including the opening track \"Java\", which features his trademark melodica playing, as well as \"King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown\", a collaboration with dub pioneer King Tubby that is widely regarded as one of the greatest dub tracks of all time. Other tracks on the album include \"Frozen Dub\", \"Brace A Boy\", and \"555 Dub Street\". Pablo's influence on Jamaican music cannot be overstated.

Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former CIA counterterrorism head Vincent Cannistraro, stating that Saddam \"knew there was a campaign to link him to September 11 and prove he had weapons of mass destruction.\"  Cannistraro further added that \"the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it.\"  Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all \"killed\" by the Bush administration because they allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in power - an outcome viewed as unacceptable.\n\nShortly after, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's national security advisor, Osama El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda.  Iraq also attempted to reach the US through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.  Nothing came of the attempts.\n\nImad Hage\nIn January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the DoD's Office of Special Plans.  Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the War on Terrorism.  He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary.  Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with Richard Perle, head of the Defense Policy Board.\n\nIn February 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence's foreign operations, Hassan al-Obeidi.  Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad didn't understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs; he then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to ascertain this.  He additionally offered oil concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years.  Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.\n\nLater that month, Hage met with Gen. Habbush in addition to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.  He was offered top priority to US firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, US inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give \"full support for any US plan\" in the Arab-Israeli peace process.  They also wished to meet with high-ranking US officials.  On February 19, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip.  Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jamie Duran.  The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan.\n\nOn February 21, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it.  Duran responded \"Mike, working this. Keep this close hold.\".  On March 7, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting).  A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle's response was \"that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go\"). Perle told the Times, \"The message was 'Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.\"\n\nThroughout March, Hage continued to pass messages from Iraqi officials to Maloof.  At one point, Maloof wrote a memo stating  \"Hage quoted Obeidi as saying this is the last window or channel through which this message has gone to the United States. He characterized the tone of Dr. Obeidi as begging.\"  Maloof contacted Perle, stating that Iraqi officials are \"prepared to meet with you in Beirut, and as soon as possible, concerning 'unconditional terms' \", and that \"Such a meeting has Saddam Hussein's clearance.\"  No action was taken.\n\nAccording to an Arab source of the Guardian, Perle sent a Saudi official the following terms for Iraq to fulfill to prevent war: \"Saddam's abdication and departure, first to a US military base for interrogation and then into supervised exile, a surrender of Iraqi troops, and the admission that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nHage has since become embroiled in a situation involving an earlier incident involving airport security that many have viewed as payback similar to the case of Valerie Plame.\n\nUnited Kingdom ultimatum \nOn March 12, 2003, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Tony Blair, and the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jack Straw proposed a draft resolution to the United Nations. If the demands for disarmament were met by 17 March, it was suggested that military action would be averted and Saddam Hussein would be allowed to remain in power.\n\nThe six tests involved:\n\n a public statement by Saddam Hussein, broadcast in Iraq, admitting possession of weapons of mass destruction, stating his regime has decided to give them up and pledging to cooperate with UN weapon inspectors.\n a commitment to allow Iraqi scientists to be interviewed by the inspectors outside Iraq.\n the surrender of, and explanation of the 10,000 litres of anthrax the Iraqis are believed still to be holding.\n a commitment to the destruction of proscribed missiles.\n an account of the unmanned aerial vehicles and remotely piloted vehicles or drones.\n a commitment to surrender all mobile bio-production laboratories for destruction.\n\nSaddam denied possession of weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi intelligence offered to allow several thousand American troops to search for banned weapons.\n\nBy offering the opportunity for Saddam to remain in power, it suggested Blair's only justification at that time was the presence of weapons of mass destruction and any other justifications are ex post facto justifications. On 27 March 2003, UK government whistleblowers suggested that even if the tests were met, Iraq would have been invaded.\n\nExile proposal \n\nIt has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.  On February 22, at a meeting in Crawford, Texas, George Bush told Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar: \n\nThe same month Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his representative, former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, to Saddam Hussein. Primakov's mission was to convince Saddam to abdicate as Iraqi president, which could prevent US invasion of Iraq. The debates failed, though. \"Saddam just tapped me on the shoulder and went out of the room\", Primakov recalled.\n\nIn late October 2005, the son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (the late president of the United Arab Emirates) stated that Saddam Hussein had in fact accepted the offer of exile in that country.  Under the deal, Saddam and his family would have fled, been granted immunity from prosecution, and elections would have been held in Iraq within six months under UN and Arab League auspices.  However, according to him, the Arab League did not bring up the issue at their emergency summit, citing rules preventing interference in the affairs of their member states, thus preventing it from being accepted.  Anonymous officials in the UAE have confirmed the report.\n\nThere was also speculation that Saddam would go into exile in Belarus. After the invasion, there was concern that members of Hussein's regime were trying to flee to that country.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Saddam's desperate offers to stave off war\n As war loomed, Iraq offered deal \n US 'rejected Iraqi concessions'\n Last-minute Iraq offer cited\n\nIraq War\nIraq–United States relations\nMiddle East peace efforts", "machine_text": "Failed Iraqi Peace Initiatives refer to the several attempts to address the persistent sectarian violence, terrorism, and civil war that plague Iraq. These initiatives sought to promote peace and stability in the country through dialogue, negotiations, and reconciliation among various political and sectarian groups. Unfortunately, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful, with many ending in stalemate, violence, or renewed conflict. One of the most significant failed peace initiatives was the Baghdad Conference in 2007, held under the auspices of the Iraqi government and attended by regional leaders. The conference aimed to address the escalating sectarian violence in the country, with the primary objective of reconciling Shia and Sunni factions. However, the talks were unsuccessful, as many Sunni delegates refused to attend, citing political grievances, and the Shia leadership was unable or unwilling to make concessions. The conference ended without a clear agreement or resolution, and the violence persisted. Another failed peace initiative was the National Reconciliation Plan of 2006, which aimed to engage all factions of Iraqi society and address the political, economic, and social grievances fueling the conflict. The plan called for a halt to sectarian violence, amnesty for insurgents, and inclusion of all factions in the political process. However, the plan was poorly implemented, lacked clear objectives, and failed to address the root causes of the conflict. The plan was abandoned, and sectarian violence continued to ravage the country. Efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict through international intervention have also failed. The United States’ role in providing security and attempting to promote democracy in Iraq has been criticized for exacerbating sectarian divisions and violence rather than improving the situation. Similarly, the United Nations’ efforts to promote peace in Iraq have been hampered by political instability, insecurity, and mistrust between factions. In conclusion, the failed peace initiatives in Iraq reflect the deep-seated political, ethnic, and religious divides that continue to plague the country. While many initiatives have been developed in good faith, they have been undermined by a lack of trust and cooperation between the various factions. To achieve lasting peace, there needs to be a concerted effort by all parties to address the root causes of the conflict, embrace tolerance and inclusivity and engage in constructive dialogue.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 522806}

This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti-imperialism and Marxism–Leninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War. The Supreme Revolutionary Council established relations with the DPRK in 1970. President of Somalia Siad Barre made two visits to Pyongyang during his tenure, once in 1971. He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance.\n\nOver the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces. Additionally, due to a resentment against Ethiopia over the country's involvement in the Korean War, North Korean advisers trained pro-Somalia guerrilla forces active in the Ethiopian–Somali conflict. This changed considerably after the communist Derg came to power in 1974, causing an eventual realignment of Soviet support towards Ethiopia. North Korea followed suit, and provided military aid to Ethiopia against Somalia during the Ethio-Somali War.\n\nAs of March 2014, North Korea and Somalia still officially maintain diplomatic relations according to the National Committee on North Korea.\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of North Korea\nForeign relations of Somalia\nSomalia–South Korea relations\nDai Hong Dan incident\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDPRK Diplomatic Relations\n\nNorth Korea\nSomalia", "machine_text": "North Korea–Somalia relations, also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea–Federal Republic of Somalia relations, refer to the bilateral ties between North Korea (DPRK) and Somalia.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union played a significant role in Somalia's foreign policy, providing military and economic aid to the country. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Somalia faced a severe economic crisis due to the loss of aid. North Korea, which was also facing economic difficulties after the loss of its traditional allies, saw an opportunity to establish relations with Somalia. In the 1990s, North Korea supplied weapons and military equipment to Somalia, including artillery and rocket systems, anti-aircraft guns, and small arms. In return, Somalia provided North Korea with access to its coastline for North Korean fishing vessels. Despite the sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations, the relationship between the two countries has remained stable. In 2011, a North Korean delegation visited Somalia to explore economic opportunities, including the possibility of developing mineral resources in the country. In recent years, North Korea has provided assistance to Somalia in the areas of agriculture, education, and health care. In 2019, the North Korean government donated $1 million worth of medical supplies to help Somalia combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relationship between North Korea and Somalia has faced criticism from some international observers. In 2017, a United Nations report accused North Korea of violating UN sanctions by providing military technology to Somalia. The report claimed that North Korean agents had operated in Somalia and provided support to the Somali government.

He led the New Democratic Party of Quebec from April to September 1989 and helped bring about its autonomy from the New Democratic Party of Canada.\n\nEarly life and political career before 1989\n\nNadeau was born in Joliette in 1953. He was a Parti Québécois (PQ) activist before joining the New Democratic Party and served as an executive assistant to legislator Guy Chevrette. He was also a supporter of the municipal Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM) and served on its economy committee. In 1988, he criticized the party's pro-business direction in government.\n\nHe ran for the House of Commons of Canada as the New Democratic Party candidate for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in the 1988 federal election. He criticized the proposed Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement on the grounds that it would hurt manufacturing jobs in his riding. Nadeau was considered one of the party's strongest candidates in Quebec, and some party insiders believed he had a chance for an upset victory. In the event, he finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Allan Koury.\n\nShortly before election day, Nadeau and six other NDP candidates with Quebec nationalist views held a press conference to denounce Canada's policies on bilingualism.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader\n\nNadeau was elected to lead the Quebec New Democratic Party in April 1989, defeating incumbent leader Roland Morin. The election contest was centred on the Quebec NDP's relationship with the federal party. At the time, the NDP had a single party organization in Quebec that was responsible for both federal and provincial matters. Several members of the Quebec NDP opposed its links to the federal party, particularly in light of ideological divisions on issues relating to Quebec nationalism. The Quebec party supported the province's Charter of the French Language, opposed the Meech Lake Accord, and were sceptical toward the Canadian constitution because it was approved without Quebec's support. Nadeau favoured the creation of a separate provincial party, while Morin initially opposed it before declaring his neutrality.\n\nNadeau, who was thirty-five years old at the time, also highlighted the generational divide between himself and the fifty-seven-year-old Morin. He said, \"The leadership choice is clearly between a democratic socialist who has a vision for the '90s and one who is clinging to the outdated notions of the '70s.\" For his part, Morin described Nadeau as a single-issue candidate focused only on the environment. Nadeau defeated Morin at a party convention held on April 30, 1989, as the party also voted to separate from the federal organization and become a completely distinct entity.\n\nThe NDP ran fifty-five candidates in the 1989 election. Its campaign began in confusion, when the party executive approved an election platform that Nadeau derided as \"naive Marxism.\" He initially threatened to resign as party leader, but refrained when the executive agreed to withdraw the offending document. Nadeau later described the platform as having resulted from the \"fertile imagination\" of a single party worker who misunderstood the instructions of its policy committee.\n\nNadeau secured a more prominent place for environmental issues in the party's revised platform, but he could not prevent party activists from adding a focus on Quebec nationalism. Nadeau opposed this on strategic grounds, arguing that it would not help the party build support. Others argued that it prevented the party from winning support among anglophone Liberals who were disgruntled with the nationalist policies of premier Robert Bourassa.\n\nClose to election day, Nadeau acknowledged that his party would not win any seats in the legislature. The NDP received about one per cent of the popular vote, and Nadeau received only 437 votes for a distant fourth-place finish in the Montreal division of Dorion. He resigned as party leader on September 26, 1989, one day after the election, saying that the Quebec NDP would never be able to succeed because of a \"hard core of Marxists\" hindering its development.\n\nSince 1989\n\nNadeau was a researcher for the municipal Democratic Coalition party in the early 1990s.\n\nElectoral record\n\nSource: [http://www2.electionsquebec.qc.ca/corpo/francais/elections-generales-provincial.asp?bsq=Dorion&section=resultats_gen&even=%271989%27&mode=%27n3%27#resul Official Results, Le Directeur général des élections du Québec].\n\nSources: Report of the Chief Electoral Officer, Thirty-fourth General Election, 1988; Report of the Chief Electoral Officer Respecting Election Expenses, 1988.\n\nReferences\n\n1953 births\nNew Democratic Party candidates for the Canadian House of Commons\nQuebec candidates for Member of Parliament\nNew Democratic Party of Quebec candidates in Quebec provincial elections\nLiving people\nPeople from Joliette\nQuebec CCF/NDP leaders", "machine_text": "Gaétan Nadeau is a Canadian educator and author known for his contributions to the field of language education.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Starfish and the Spider\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations is a 2006 book by Ori Brafman (author of the 2010 book Click: The Magic of Instant Connections) and Rod Beckstrom. It is an exploration of the implications of the rise of decentralized organizations such as Grokster and Wikipedia. The book contrasts them to centralized organizations, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, using compendia of knowledge as examples. The spider and starfish analogy refers to the contrasting biological nature of the respective organisms, starfish having a decentralized neural structure permitting regeneration.\n\nIn addition to giving historical examples of decentralized organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous and the Apaches and analyzing their nature in contrast to centralized organizations, the book considers conflict between centralized and decentralized organizations, including the \"If you can't beat them, join them\" solution of creating hybrid organizations such as Citizendium. A chapter towards the end of the book explores the concept of the \"sweet spot\", the optimal mix of decentralized and centralized attributes.\n\nSummary\n\nDon Verelli was an attorney who championed the effort for MGM to crack down on the peer-to-peer music website Grokster. But although the record labels won the lawsuits, other groups such as Kazaa, and eMule surfaced. The authors compare the record companies to \"spiders\" – organizations under the control of a central brain or leader – while the smaller organizations are more like \"starfish\" – if a limb is severed, the remaining parts are able to regenerate the entire body, resulting in two or more starfish. The spider organization is compared to the Aztec Empire which fell when Montezuma was defeated by Hernán Cortés and his Spanish army, but the starfish organization is compared to the Apaches, who decentralized and became nomadic, and which the Spanish army could not defeat.\n\nDave Garrison of Netcom attempts to explain the Internet to executives in Paris, but is met with questions such as who would run the Internet. The authors look into the starfish Alcoholics Anonymous, which survives and thrives even away from the founder. They also look into the history of the music industry since the 19th century from live performers to recording on small labels to ownership from the big five record companies to Napster and other peer-to-peer networks. They list questions that determine whether an organization is more like a spider or a starfish. The authors discuss some founders of starfish organizations: Niklas Zennstrom and Skype; Craig Newmark and Craigslist. They discuss the formation of the Apache software model and how editors work on Wikipedia articles. They then discuss the starfish self-organization of participants in the Burning Man festival.\n\nEnglish lawyer Granville Sharp's decision to defend the freedom of a slave named Jonathan Strong leads him to connect with the Quakers and to advocate for the abolition of the slave trade. The authors use Sharp's story to illustrate five foundational principles called the Five Legs: 1) Circles; 2) The Catalyst; 3) Ideology; 4) The Preexisting Network; 5) The Champion. They apply the Five Legs to the story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton who served as a catalyst to the women's rights movement in the USA with Susan B. Anthony as the champion. They then focus on some examples of catalysts: Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia; Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, who worked for the city of San Francisco and later Goodwill; entrepreneur Auren Hoffman and Josh Sage. They list a set of catalyst's tools including: Genuine Interest in Others, Loose Connections, Mapping, Desire to Help, Meet People Where They Are, Emotional Intelligence, Trust, Inspiration, Tolerance for Ambiguity, Hands-Off Approach and Receding. They contrast the work of a catalyst with that of a CEO.\n\nUsing the Animal Liberation Front as an example of a decentralized group similar to Al-Qaeda, the authors suggest three strategies of dealing with decentralized groups: Changing Ideology (or introducing better competing ideologies), Centralizing Them (Cow Principle, what defeated the Apaches), and Decentralizing Yourself (If you can't beat 'em, join 'em) The authors suggest organization uses a hybrid model that blends both centralized and decentralized concepts, such as with eBay. They also cite other instances of hybrids such as Amazon.com letting volunteer reviewers contribute and Intuit having a TaxAlmanac website for people to help each other. The authors discuss Peter Drucker's assessment of General Motors's management process, how it led to Toyota taking over the auto industry, and how they later collaborated on the NUMMI plant. Similarly the iTunes model of pricing single songs has been a \"sweet spot\" for Apple and their online music store, and other companies are moving to an open-source model with their software.\n\nThe authors use a series of analogies throughout their book, summarizing their thoughts with Ten Rules: Diseconomies of scale, The network effect, The power of chaos, Knowledge at the edge, Everyone wants to contribute, Beware the hydra response, Catalysts rule, The values are the organization, Measure Monitor and Manage, and Flatten or be flattened.\n\nReception\n\nSee also \n Leaderless resistance\n Unorganisation\n The Cathedral and the Bazaar\n\nWorks cited \n The Starfish And the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations, Penguin (October 5, 2006), hardcover, 230 pages,\n\nReferences \n\n Originally adapted from the Wikinfo article The Starfish and the Spider\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2006 books\nOrganizational structure\nWorks about social movements\nCommunity building", "machine_text": "The Starfish and the Spider is a book by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, published in 2006. The book discusses the concept of decentralized organizations and how they can be successful in today's world. The authors present an analogy of a starfish and a spider to illustrate this concept. A spider is a centralized organization, with a clear hierarchy and a centralized decision-making process. A starfish, on the other hand, is a decentralized organization, with no central control over the different parts of the body. If you cut a spider in half, it will die. However, if you cut a starfish in half, it will regenerate itself from the remaining parts of its body. The book argues that decentralized organizations are becoming increasingly successful in today's world due to a number of factors. First, advances in technology have made it easier to coordinate decentralized organizations. Second, the globalization of markets has led to increased competition and the need for organizations to be more flexible and responsive to changing conditions. The authors point to a number of examples of successful decentralized organizations, such as Wikipedia, Craigslist, and the Apache Software Foundation. These organizations are able to innovate and adapt quickly to changing conditions because they are not tied to a centralized decision-making process. The Starfish and the Spider has been praised for its clear and engaging writing style, as well as its insights into the future of organizational structures. Some critics, however, have argued that the book oversimplifies the complexities of organizational structure and overlooks the challenges that decentralized organizations face in terms of coordination and accountability. Overall, The Starfish and the Spider is a thought-provoking book that raises important questions about the future of organizational structure in today's rapidly changing world.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8484001}

His later years were devoted to the production of animated cartoons in Canada. After firing Shamus Culhane from the animator's supervising director job on Rocket Robin Hood, director Ralph Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita were brought to Toronto, not knowing that Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit.\n\nFailing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas.

It was developed by George Dantzig and focuses on the duality between the primal and dual linear programming problems. The theorem is a fundamental result in linear programming, and it is of utmost importance in developing algorithms and understanding the structure of linear programming problems. The theorem states that for every feasible solution of the primal linear programming problem, there exists a feasible solution of the dual problem such that the objective function value of the dual solution is less than or equal to the objective function value of the primal solution. Moreover, if the primal problem has an optimal solution, then the dual problem also has an optimal solution, and the optimal values of the two problems are equal. The theorem has significant implications for the efficient solution of both primal and dual linear programming problems. It provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between the primal and dual problems and enables the development of algorithms for solving these problems. The primal problem involves maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to a set of constraints expressed as linear equations or inequalities. The dual problem is created by introducing a set of variables associated with the constraints of the primal problem. The objective function of the dual problem is to minimize or maximize a function subject to the constraints. The FTLP is used in various fields, including economics, finance, transportation, and computer science. It provides a powerful tool for optimizing various business and industrial processes and optimizing resource allocation. In summary, the fundamental theorem of linear programming is a powerful tool used to optimize various business and industrial processes.

The battles took place in the North Atlantic Ocean between 1939 and 1943 and were essential in determining the outcome of the war. The North Atlantic was a crucial region during World War II, as it was the main shipping lane connecting America and Europe. The German navy had a powerful submarine force, or U-Boats, which posed a significant threat to Allied shipping. The British navy, on the other hand, had a sizeable fleet of destroyers and battleships tasked with protecting the convoys from German U-Boat attacks. The North Atlantic campaign began in September 1939, with the sinking of the British carrier HMS Courageous. The following year, in 1940, the German navy launched a massive submarine offensive against the British convoys, known as the Battle of the Atlantic. This battle saw intense fighting between the German and British navies, with both sides suffering losses. The Royal Navy responded by investing in the development of new technologies such as radar, depth charges, and sonar, which aided in detecting and destroying German U-Boats. Throughout the campaign, the British navy engaged in several significant battles. In November 1940, the Battle of Cape Spartivento saw a naval engagement between the British and Italian navies, resulting in the sinking of two Italian cruisers. In March 1941, the British navy engaged with the German battleships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The British lost their flagship, HMS Hood, in the battle, and the Germans were able to break through the English Channel. The North Atlantic campaign ended in 1943, with the Allies achieving a decisive victory. The Allied forces were able to overcome the German U-Boat threat, and the convoys could travel safely across the Atlantic without fear of attack. The successful outcome of the North Atlantic campaign was essential to the Allied victory in World War II, highlighting the crucial role played by naval forces in warfare.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 27875112}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Shot hole disease\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Shot hole disease (also called Coryneum blight) is a serious fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and concentric lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes shot hole disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.\n\nHosts and symptoms\n\nThe fungal pathogen Wilsonomyces carpophilus affects members of the Prunus genera. Almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, prune and cherry trees can be affected. Both edible and ornamental varieties are vulnerable to infection. Almost all over-ground parts of the plants are affected including the fruits, buds and the stems, but the damage is most noticeable on the leaves. The symptoms begin with small (1/10-1/4”) reddish or purplish-brown spots with light green or yellow ring around them. As the disease progresses the damaged areas become slightly larger and then dry up and fall away, leaving BB-sized holes behind. As the fungus spreads, more leaf tissue is damaged until the leaf falls. Significant infections can reduce the amount of photosynthesis that can occur, weakening the plant, and decreasing fruit production. The infection on the fruits in turn begins as small purple spots that develop into gray to white lesions. Gummosis may occur (both on the fruits and the stems as well). These lesions leave toughened spots on the skin, and in some cases the fruit may be lost. Infected buds may appear darker than normal. Branches may develop concentric lesions when infected. These lesions may girdle a twig and kill it.\n\nDisease cycle\nW. carpophilus overwinters in infected buds and in twig cankers. Asexual spores (conidia) are dispersed in spring when moisture levels increase or as a result of overhead watering. Spores are pigmented and remain viable, in a dormant state, for months. Infection can occur any time moisture is present for at least 24 hours, as long as temperatures are above . At higher temperatures, infection occurs more quickly. W. carpophilus infection takes only 6 hours at .\n\nManagement\nW. carpophilus can remain viable for several months and spores are often airborne. Since the fungi thrive in wet conditions, overhead watering should be avoided. Remove and dispose of any infected buds, leaves, fruit and twigs. In fall, fixed copper or Bordeaux mixture can be applied.\n\nImportance\nShot hole disease is a major concern of the stone fruit industry. It is estimated that 80% of the California almond crop may be infested with shot hole disease, resulting in a potential yield loss of 50-75%. In the 1930s, it was found that applications of Bordeaux mixture reduces shot hole disease on peaches from 80% to 9%.\n\nReferences\n\nFungal tree pathogens and diseases\nStone fruit tree diseases", "machine_text": "Shot hole disease is a plant disease caused by a variety of fungal pathogens. It primarily affects stone fruit trees such as peach, nectarine, apricot, and plum trees, but can also impact ornamental plants such as dogwood, photinia, and cherry laurel. The disease is characterized by small, circular holes that form on the leaves as the infected tissues fall out. The disease causes defoliation and can lead to reduced fruit production and dieback of branches. The symptoms of shot hole disease typically begin in the spring and early summer months when the fungal pathogen infects the newly emerging leaves. The disease is most severe in wet weather conditions when the spores of the fungus are able to easily spread from tree to tree. It is also common in areas with high humidity, especially during the growing season. Fungicides are the most common treatment for shot hole disease, but early detection and proper cultural practices can also help prevent or reduce infection. Pruning out infected branches can also help reduce the spread of the disease. However, certain fungicides may be harmful to bees and beneficial insects, so it is important to carefully follow label instructions when applying these products. Preventative measures include proper sanitation around the affected trees, practicing good hygiene during pruning, and maintaining proper nutrition and hydration levels for the trees. This helps encourage strong, healthy growth which can make them more resistant to the pathogen. Overall, shot hole disease can be a serious problem for trees and should be addressed promptly to prevent further spread and damage. With appropriate treatment and preventative measures, it is possible to maintain healthy and productive trees for years to come.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 50346824}

At different times, it could be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor, by the Imperial Diet, or by courts like the League of the Holy Court (Vehmgericht) or the Reichskammergericht.\n\nPeople under imperial ban, known as Geächtete (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as Vogelfreie, lit. \"free as a bird\"), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the excommunication of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.\n\nThose banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The Aberacht, a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed.\n\nThe imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole Imperial Estates. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its Imperial immediacy and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor.\n\nFamous people placed under the imperial ban included:\n\n 1180 Henry the Lion, for refusing military support to Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor against the cities of the Lombard League.\n 1225 Count Frederick of Isenberg, for killing his uncle Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne.\n 1235 King Henry (VII) of Germany, for his rebellion against his father the Emperor Frederick II.\n 1276 King Ottokar II of Bohemia, for his capture of imperial lands from Rudolph I.\n 1309 John Parricida, for the murder of his uncle King Albert I of Germany.\n 1415 Frederick IV, Duke of Austria for aiding the flight of Antipope John XXIII from the Council of Constance.\n 1512 and 1518 Götz von Berlichingen, the first time for robbery, the second for kidnapping.\n 1521 Martin Luther and his supporters, for claiming that some doctrines practiced by the Catholic Church were contrary to the Bible or had no biblical basis.\n 1546 John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, for leading the Schmalkaldic League.\n 1566 Wilhelm von Grumbach, for insurgency.\n 1621 Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and his supporters Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg and Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim, for seizing power in Bohemia.\n 1706 Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Joseph Clemens, Elector of Cologne, for supporting France in the War of the Spanish Succession (ban reversed in 1714)\n 1793 Georg Forster, for collaboration with the French Republic.\n\nThe imperial ban imposed by the Emperor Rudolf II on the city of Donauwörth after an anti-Catholic riot was one of the incidents leading to the Thirty Years' War.\n\nAn imperial ban on Bremen preceded the 1654 Swedish attack on Bremen.\n\nSee also \n King's ban, a royal order or prohibition in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nReferences \n\nPunishments\nLegal history of the Holy Roman Empire", "machine_text": "Imperial Ban The Imperial Ban was a legal tool used in the Holy Roman Empire to excommunicate or banish an individual from the empire. The ban was a powerful tool against political enemies and was often used by the emperor or princes to punish those who threatened their power and authority. The ban was first introduced during the reign of Emperor Henry IV in the 11th century. It was used to punish Pope Gregory VII, who was leading a reform movement within the Catholic Church and had challenged Henry’s authority over the appointment of bishops. Henry responded by issuing the Imperial Ban, which declared Gregory excommunicated and banned from the empire. The ban had serious consequences for those who were targeted. The individual’s property would be confiscated, and they would be expelled from their home and community. They would also lose all rights of citizenship and protection, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The ban could only be lifted by the emperor or a majority of the princes of the empire. In some cases, a ban could be lifted if the individual demonstrated contrition and begged for forgiveness. The use of the Imperial Ban became more widespread in the 16th century during the Reformation. It was used by both Catholic and Protestant leaders to suppress their opponents and maintain their power. Many Protestant leaders were banned from the empire, including Martin Luther and John Calvin. The Imperial Ban was abolished in 1806 with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the concept of excommunication and banishment still exists in some legal systems today. In modern times, the use of such extreme measures is limited and is subject to legal processes and human rights protections.

Starting in the 2017-2018 school year, Decatur High will no longer continue the IB program.\n\nIn 2018, the Decatur City Schools, in a massive realignment of school districting, opened a new DHS campus across Somerville Road Southeast from its location of several decades on Prospect Drive. The new Decatur High was built on the site of the former Somerville Road Elementary School, whose students were eventually moved to the old Oak Park Middle School (subsequently renamed Oak Park Elementary). Students who formerly attended Oak Park Middle were moved into the old DHS campus, which was renovated and renamed Decatur Middle.

The high school's sports teams often use the field for practice.\n\nPrior to 1949, the Decatur football team played at the 3,000-person capacity Benson Field, now a part of Rhodes Ferry Park along the shores of the Tennessee River, located next to the now-closed Riverview High School, Decatur High's predecessor.\n\nPrior to 2018, when Austin High School relocated and got a stadium of its own (at the same time of Decatur High's physical relocation across Somerville Road), both of the high schools in Decatur played their home games in the stadium, with their schedules arranged accordingly; occasionally, that meant that one of the teams had to play a home game on a Thursday night, instead of Friday as is customary in Alabama high school athletics.  The one exception was the Decatur-Austin game.  In that case, one team occupied the away side while the other manned the home side.  The schools alternated hosting each year, despite the game occurring on Decatur High property, akin to the practice of Alabama and Auburn college football in the years when the \"Iron Bowl\" was held at Legion Field in Birmingham. This football game usually sold out the stadium, and brought in crowds of over 10,000, in a city of perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 population, to watch the intra-city rivalry.\n\nFootball\nDecatur High has produced many players that went on to play at the collegiate and professional levels, including Jerraud Powers and Rolando McClain.\n\nOther long-tenured Red Raider coaches, other than Ogle, are Earl Webb and Steve Rivers, father of famed NFL quarterback Philip Rivers. However, the younger Rivers played his high school ball at Athens High School in nearby Athens, Alabama, where his father was coaching at the time. As of 2021, Jere Adcock, Steve Rivers' successor, is the current head coach at DHS.\n\nThe Decatur High School Football Team won the 1971 State 4A Football Championship under the leadership of Coach Earl Webb and coaches Wally Burnham, Paul Glover and Jimmy Holley.

The movie was directed by Bernard Girard and starred James Caan, Stefanie Powers, and Aldo Ray. The film was produced by Sequoia Pictures and was distributed by American International Pictures. The story of Gone with the West takes place in the American West during the 19th century. The plot revolves around a man named Jud McGraw (played by James Caan) who is released from prison after serving time for the murder of a man who stole his horse. Upon his release, Jud becomes a hired gun for a wealthy landowner named Colby (played by Aldo Ray). However, Jud soon becomes disillusioned with his new life and decides to leave Colby's employ. While on the run, Jud meets a woman named Nora (played by Stefanie Powers) while hiding in her cabin. Nora is also on the run from the authorities and the two quickly fall in love. However, their happiness is short-lived as Colby is hot on their trail and is determined to take Jud down. Gone with the West features stunning visuals of the American West and is known for its intense, action-packed scenes. The film was notable at the time for its portrayal of Native Americans in a more sympathetic light than most Western films of the era. Despite receiving mixed reviews upon its initial release, Gone with the West has since gained a cult following and is considered by some to be a hidden gem of the Western genre. Its unique storyline and strong performances from its lead actors make it a must-watch for fans of the genre and film history.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 26018860}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Uppåkra\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Uppåkra is a village and parish in Staffanstorp Municipality, in Scania, southern Sweden,  located five kilometres south of Lund.\nThe village is known for its Iron Age archaeological site, which has been actively excavated since 1996.\n\nHistory\nUppåkra was situated on the ancient main road between Trelleborg and Helsingborg in what was to become the Danish kingdom. The original foundation of Uppåkra is dated to the last century BC, although its importance appears to have increased in the fifth century. It seems likely that the rulers of Uppåkra by then wielded influence over most or all of West Scania, i.e. the land along the Trelleborg–Helsingborg main road, known for extraordinarily fertile plains.\n\nUppåkra declined and was possibly in part relocated to Lund in the 990s. Knowledge about the decline of Uppåkra and the relocation to Lund is still unsure. Hence Uppåkra is held to be the direct predecessor of the city of Lund. However, the area has been continuously inhabited all since, with the two villages of Lilla Uppåkra and Stora Uppåkra mentioned as 'first and second Uppåkra' in medieval documents. Like the rest of Scania, Uppåkra was Danish until 1658. In early modern documents from the Danish era, the two villages were called Opager, which remained their name in the local dialect until the mid-20th century.\n\nArchaeology\nA Bronze to Iron Age settlement was found in 1934, when a farm was built close to the church. The first excavation that year was done by the Archaeologist Bror Magnus Vifot.\nGeological studies carried out by a sugar company in the 1930s revealed that the site around the church of Uppåkra was extremely rich in phosphate, the highest concentration of it in Scania. Since excrement contains phosphate, this indicates the presence of many cattle and people over time. The study was conducted by Olof Arrhenius across the province of Scania.\n\nIn the middle of 1990 investigations with metal detectors revealed almost 30,000 gold, silver and bronze objects.\nArchaeological excavations in a 100-acre (0.40 km2) field intensified in 1996: they show Uppåkra to have been among the richest and largest Iron Age–Viking Age towns on the Scandinavian Peninsula. \nFor centuries, maybe for most of the first millennium, Uppåkra was a place of religious and political power; remains of a pre-Christian temple excavated during  2000–2004 demonstrated that it was also an important cult place.\n\nDuring excavations in the summer of 2007, the remains of a building destroyed by fire were investigated. The building was situated just to the west of the temple.  It was presumably a longhouse of more than 40 metres in length, built in the 5th or 6th century. The excavations also yielded a large amount of ceramic, bone, and glass artefacts, and a number of metal objects in iron, bronze and gold,\nincluding fibulae, two identically stamped bracteates, and a probable surgical instrument.  \nOne of the objects excavated in 2007, interpreted as representing an ornamental lion, made headlines due to its peculiar resemblance to Mickey Mouse.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Uppåkra's website\n Historical Museum Lund Barbaricum\n\nArchaeological sites in Sweden\nScania\nPopulated places in Staffanstorp Municipality\nViking Age populated places\nPopulated places in Skåne County", "machine_text": "Uppåkra is an archaeological site located in southern Sweden, near the town of Lund. It was a significant center of power and trade during the Iron Age and Viking Age, dating from approximately 200-1050 AD. Uppåkra was one of the most important places in Scandinavia during this time, and it is considered one of the country's most important archaeological sites. The site was first discovered in the 1930s and has been extensively excavated since then. Some of the most significant findings include the remains of an early Christian church, a large marketplace, and a number of residential buildings, as well as the remains of a defensive wall and several fortresses. Uppåkra was a major trading center, connecting the Baltic region with continental Europe and the British Isles. The site was strategically located at the intersection of several important trade routes, and it is believed to have played a key role in the development of the Viking Age trade networks. The area around Uppåkra is rich in resources such as iron, timber, and fertile land, making it an attractive location for settlement. The site is also notable for its early Christian church, one of the oldest in Sweden, which was built in the 900s. The church was likely built to serve the growing Christian population in the area, and it has been suggested that the construction of the church was encouraged by the local ruling elite as a way to help legitimize their power. Today, visitors can see the remains of Uppåkra's fortifications, marketplaces, and residential buildings. The site is open to the public and has a small museum showcasing some of the most significant finds from the excavations. Uppåkra remains an important site for researchers studying the history and archaeology of the Iron Age and Viking Age in Scandinavia, as well as for individuals interested in the region's cultural heritage.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1476695}

From  to , Schueler's White Sox teams had regular season win-loss totals of 817–729, while winning two division championships, with a 2–7 record in two postseason appearances.\n\nMinor leagues\nSchueler was selected in the twelfth round of the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but never signed a contract to play with the team. The following season, he was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the third round of the 1967 draft (secondary phase) and signed a contract shortly thereafter.

He pitched two innings and only gave up one hit in that game, but despite his efforts, the Braves lost. Schueler went on to start thirty-eight games over two years with the Braves.\n\nAfter the  season ended, Schueler was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies for infielder Craig Robinson and pitcher Barry Lersch. After a mediocre season as a starter, the Phillies converted Schueler to a relief pitcher. He pitched two more seasons in Philadelphia as a reliever and spot starter.\n\nJust days before the  season began, the Minnesota Twins purchased Schueler from the Phillies. With the Twins, he pitched as a reliever and spot starter, as he did in Philadelphia. Schueler's stay with the Twins lasted only one season, as he became a free agent after the  season.\n\nA month after becoming a free agent, Schueler was signed by the Chicago White Sox to be a reliever and spot starter.

He worked in this new position through the  season.\n\nBefore the  season, he was hired by the Chicago Cubs as a special assistant to the president and general manager. Two years later, the St. Louis Cardinals hired Schueler to be the special assistant to the general manager. He was part of the 2006 Cardinals organization that won the World Series. In , the San Francisco Giants hired Schueler to be a scout and evaluate major and minor league players and acquisitions.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club was founded during the 2013 Fall semester. The club's president, founder, and head coach, Jeremy Berger, wanted to offer USFSP students the opportunity to play college baseball competitively. Even though the team is treated as a fraternity, both male and female students are welcomed to join the team.\n\nThe team's opening game was against the University of South Florida Tampa Campus' team. The USFSP baseball team won and earned well deserved bragging rights and huge momentum the team carried throughout the rest of the season. The team finished its inaugural opening season with an 18–5 season and played against larger, well established teams like the University of Florida and Florida State University. The team also traveled to Miami to play the University of Miami. However, because the team is considered only a club and is not a registered, official team, the USFSP Baseball Club was ineligible to play or qualify for any championships or playoffs.\n\t\nHowever, the team does have long-term plans of becoming an NCAA team. In the meantime, the officers and players are focusing on recruiting more talented players. This way, the team can gain more acknowledgment and support from faculty and students. They also want to establish a name for themselves amongst other colleges. The team also hopes that more fans will come out to support the baseball team during their games next season, even if they do not like baseball. Players have said that simply coming to the game to support student athletes, friends, and classmates is encouraging.\n\t\nDespite being barred from championships at the present time, the team did have some special acknowledgments and awards to accompany its amazing first season including an acknowledgment from USF President Dr. Judy Genshaft and was the  2013-14 New Organization of the Year. Berger was also nominated for student leader of the year.\n\t\nThe season began on February 15, 2014, with USF St. Petersburg playing against USF Tampa. The competition was dubbed “The Battle of the Bay” and was inspired by the already existent inter-campus rivalries. Dozens of students from both campuses arrived to cheer on their teams. Although the Tampa team, which was also playing its inaugural game, lost the 9-inning contest, both teams hope to make the inter-campus games an annual tradition.\n\nFor its first season, the team made Al Lang Stadium and Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium its home stadiums. The Al Lang Stadium, a couple blocks away from the school campus and in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, hosts dozens of sporting events for several different teams and sports. During soccer season, the stadium is transformed into a soccer field and hosts The Rowdies, the St. Petersburg professional soccer team. When the season is over, however, the field is transformed into a baseball field and allows for amateur baseball teams to play. The Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium was the former spring training field for the Tampa Bay Rays. However, when the Rays moved spring training to the Charlotte Sports Park, the Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium started hosting high school baseball teams and baseball tournaments. \n\t\nOn June 5, 2014, the St. Petersburg City Council held a meeting to determine if future contracts with the USFSP team will be made. The council decided in favor for these future contracts to be written. Now, the team has a place to play for at least one more season.\n\t\nUSF St. Petersburg has yet to build a stadium for any of the school's organized sports to be played on teams. The small campus does have a gym with dozens of work out machines, a pool, a couple basketball courts, and a waterfront program that gives sailing, scuba diving, and paddle boarding lessons just to name a few of its services. \n\t\nThe only team that the USFSP campus houses is the sailing team. This team keeps all of its equipment in the school's harbor and waterfront storage house. Because the school borders against the water, the sailing team practices and races in the ocean behind the campus. Also, because of the nature of this water sport, no benches or bleachers have been made to observe the races from land. \n\t\nAll the other USF teams are based out of the USF Tampa campus. However, even in Tampa, the teams often have to go to a different, already established stadium for professional teams in order to play. Even the USF football team has to travel to Raymond James Stadium (the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) to play opponents in games.\n\t\nDespite the USFSP baseball team having an impressive first season and bring more sports to the St. Petersburg campus, it is not the first time a baseball team has represented the small, coastal campus. For several years during the 1970s, not a full decade after the campus was founded, students had built a  team as well. Like today, the team was categorized as a club rather than an actual, registered team - likely due to the fact that it is a club, not a registered team. Players brought their own gloves, bats, and other equipment in order to play since the school did not provide any. Despite this, the team still played larger universities and had impressive season records, much like today's team. Because the USFSP would rarely win against these other registered teams, it often confused the other team about what to do with their records. Other universities did not know if these games should count as wins since the USFSP team was not registered. It was common for these teams to decide not to include the USFSP games in their records. They simply considered the games to be practice or warm ups for the rest of the season.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nUniversity of South Florida\n2013 establishments in Florida", "machine_text": "The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club (USFSPBC) is the baseball team representing the University of South Florida St. Petersburg in NCAA Division III intercollegiate baseball competitions.

Initially encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan, the county shrank in size as the population and economy of the north and central western plains grew and new counties were created out of the developed areas; the Zhuluo county was eventually limited to a under-developed area in south-western Taiwan. In 1787 the county underwent further restructuring and was renamed Chiayi County.\n\nName\nThe city now known as Chiayi originally took its name from the aboriginal tribe who lived there: the Tirosen. The former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (), a representation of the original Formosan-language name. This town (in reality a village of perhaps one or two thousand people) gave its name to the surrounding area, dropping the -shan to leave Zhuluo as the name for the county as a whole. In some English-language texts the spellings Chu-lo or Choolo are used.\n\n1684–1723\nWhen the Qing wrested the island from the control of the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, Taiwan was made a prefecture under the administration of Fujian Province. This new Taiwan Prefecture included three hien or districts; Zhuluo County covered the central western plains and the north. \n\nThe county started as a catch-all for the areas not incorporated in one of the other, smaller, more developed counties. Zhuluo County was initially made up of four Villages () and 34 Communities ( - the name normally given to aboriginal settlements). The villages were all near the border with Taiwan County, with the communities making up the rest of Zhuluo County. At this point in time the county covered 18,499 km2, more than half the total area of Taiwan, with the county seat in the Jialixing area of Kaihua Village (modern-day Jiali District, Tainan).\n\nIn 1697 the Qing Imperial official Yu Yonghe visited the area and wrote that \"Zhuluo and Fengshan have no residents, only savages\" i.e. there were no Han Chinese settlements in the county. In 1694 there was only one registered market in Zhuluo as opposed to 17 in the far smaller Taiwan County, a situation which reflected the disparity in the Han Chinese populations in both counties.\n\nIn the first two decades of the eighteenth century Han settlers began to encroach more extensively into Zhuluo, with significant Chinese populations cultivating in the areas around modern-day Douliu and Changhua City. Settlers who attempted to move further north were however violently resisted by aboriginal tribes. In 1704 the administrative seat of the county was relocated to Zhuluoshan, today known as Chiayi City.\n\n1723–1787\nBy 1723, following the Zhu Yigui rebellion, the number of Han Chinese settlements in central and northern Taiwan had increased dramatically. To facilitate better administration Zhuluo was split into three. The northernmost section, corresponding to modern-day Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, and Miaoli County, was called Tamsui Subprefecture (淡水廳). Changhua County (彰化縣) was also created, encompassing the area of modern Changhua County, Taichung, half of Yunlin County and three townships of Nantou County. The remaining area, some 3,844 km2 from the Huwei River (虎尾溪) to the borders with Taiwan County and the ungoverned aboriginal areas, remained under the name of Zhuluo County.\n\nIn 1787, the Lin Shuangwen rebellion against Qing rule began, and rebels gained control of almost the entire island. Imperial troops regained control of the city and vicinity in 1788. In 1787, the county was renamed Chiayi County () to reflect the fidelity of the city during the incident.\n\nSee also\n History of Taiwan\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFormer counties of Taiwan\n1684 establishments in Taiwan\n1787 disestablishments in Taiwan\nQing dynasty", "machine_text": "Zhuluo County is located in the northwest of Yunnan Province, China, with an area of 3,057 square kilometers and a population of 141,474 as of 2020.

The construction of the barracks was completed in the 1970s and they replaced earlier barracks built in the city. The barracks are primarily used for training soldiers and for administrative purposes. The facilities at the barracks include an obstacle course, firing ranges, and classrooms for training. The barracks played an important role in the Battle of Arnhem, which took place in September 1944. During the battle, British and Polish paratroopers attempted to seize key bridges and capture the city. However, the German defenders were able to hold them off and the battle resulted in a decisive German victory. The Walcheren Barracks are a reminder of the sacrifices made by the Allied forces during the battle and of the bravery of those who fought there. Today, the Walcheren Barracks are an important training center for the Dutch military. They are used to train soldiers in a wide range of skills, from marksmanship to leadership. The barracks are also used as a base for the 11th Infantry Battalion, which is one of the most highly trained and respected units in the Netherlands Armed Forces. In addition to its military importance, the Walcheren Barracks are also a popular tourist attraction.

The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.\n\nBruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a divorce by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer João Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody. Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts. \nNew Jersey courts have denied visitation rights for both grandparents months before the grandfather's death.\n\nInternational ramifications\nThe case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level Brazilian and American officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit. The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman Chris Smith (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.\n\nMedia coverage\nOn 30 January 2009, NBC's news program Dateline NBC broadcast a lengthy piece titled \"Fighting for Sean\" on the case and an interview by program's Meredith Vieira with David Goldman, the child's father.\nThe Dateline piece caught the attention of Congressman Chris Smith (R-New Jersey) who contacted the father and offered help. He wrote a major article in The Washington Times on 19 June 2009 titled \"Will Brazil Do The Right Thing\". \nGoldman was interviewed on many media outlets including in Today a few times, on Dr Phil show on 1 December 2008, on CNN's Larry King Live on 4 March 2009, on CTV's Canada AM and on Fox News Channel's On the Record\nThere were public comments on the case by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 4 March 2009 on NBC's Today show and by Brazilian President Lula on CNN on 23 March 2009.    \nOn 15 July 2009, David Goldman testified in front of a Congress committee about child abductions. On 16 July 2009, NBC's Today broadcast a one-hour interview with him.\nNBC paid for a charter flight for David Goldman and 9-year-old Sean back to the U.S. NBC News correspondent Jeff Rossen, along with other members of his team, was on board the plane. The Society of Professional Journalists condemned NBC News for practicing \"checkbook journalism\" by chartering the jet. Mr. Goldman stated in his book, A Father's Love, that NBC had already chartered the jet to fly its news crew home in time for Christmas Day, and when the courts granted him custody on December 24, NBC offered the ride so that he wouldn't have to risk taking a public flight.\nOn 8 January 2010, Dateline NBC broadcast a special on the case upon the successful return of the child to his father. The 2-hour special presented by Meredith Vieira was titled \"Bringing Sean Home: The Untold Story\". Parts of the exclusive interview and shots of the father-son reunion were broadcast on NBC's Today on 28 December 2009. Parts of this special were aired in Brazil by Rede Record newsmagazine series Domingo Espetacular presented by Paulo Henrique Amorim, on 17 January 2010.\n The season 20 episode of Law & Order titled \"Brazil\" was inspired by the custody case.\n On April 27, 2012 Dateline aired an exclusive interview with Sean Goldman that was conducted by Meredith Vieira.\n\nSee also\nInternational child abduction in Brazil\nInternational child abduction in the United States\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBring Sean Home Foundation\nHelp Bring Sean Home MySpace site\nSean Goldman page on Help Find My Child site\nTranscript, audio, video of Rep.

The case gained significant media attention and sparked a legal battle that lasted for over five years. In June 2004, Bruna Bianchi, Sean Goldman's mother, took him to Brazil for a two-week vacation and never returned. Sean's father, David Goldman, was left with no choice but to petition the Brazilian government to seek the return of his son to the United States. Brazil is known for its complex and bureaucratic legal system, and David's fight for custody of his son was long and arduous. The Brazilian courts initially granted Bianchi custody of Sean. However, David filed an appeal against this decision and continued to fight for custody. The case eventually caught the attention of United States lawmakers, including then-Senator Frank Lautenberg, who introduced a bill that called for the immediate return of Sean to his father in the United States. The case also garnered attention from international organizations like the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. After years of legal battles, David was finally granted custody of Sean in December 2009, when the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Sean should be returned to his father in the United States. In a dramatic television moment, David was reunited with his son at the U.S. consulate in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Day. Since then, the Goldman child abduction case has become a landmark case in international child custody disputes. The case has raised questions about international parental abduction and the need for cooperation between countries to protect the rights of children caught in the middle of legal disputes. Today, Sean Goldman lives with his father in New Jersey, and the case has since inspired new legislation and advocacy efforts aimed at protecting the rights of parents and children facing similar situations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25603498}

In 2020, it created a social media page called \"Ghana Gay Blackmail List\" to fight blackmailing and extortion of gay men by cataloguing blackmailing incidents and providing a link for LGBT persons who have been blackmailed to submit reports. Alex Kofi Donkor, Executive Director of LGBT+ Rights Ghana stated that the page was created after many LGBT Ghanaians were assaulted, threatened at gunpoint, and robbed by blackmailers, but received no assistance from the police.\n\nIn 2021, LGBT+ Rights Ghana opened its office in Accra and invited some diplomats, celebrities, activists, and LGBT+ persons to the event which was also intended to raise funds. This event caused outrage across the country. Additionally, there was opposition from anti-gay organizations which called on the government to shut down the organization and asked for the Inspector General of Police to arrest all persons associated with the organization. In response, LGBT+ Rights Ghana issued a statement asserting that LGBT persons in Ghana are entitled to human rights, including freedom of association.

Same-sex relations between consenting adults are illegal in the country and are punishable by imprisonment. The law has been used to discriminate against the LGBT+ community and to deny them their basic human rights. Ghana has a very conservative culture, and most people are opposed to homosexuality. The government and religious institutions have been known to be vocal against homosexuality, and this has made it difficult for the LGBT+ community to come out openly and demand their rights. There have been several instances where gay people have been beaten, harassed, and even killed in the country, and the government has often turned a blind eye. Despite this, there have been several efforts to advocate for LGBT+ rights in Ghana. There are a few organizations that work towards this cause, such as the LGBT+ Rights Ghana, which was established in 2018. The group seeks to create awareness of LGBT+ issues and to provide support to the community. The group has faced opposition from religious organizations and some members of the government. In 2019, the opening of a community space for LGBT+ people in the country was met with public outrage, and the place was shut down by the government. In 2021, an anti-LGBT+ bill was presented to Ghana’s parliament, which seeks to criminalize the promotion of LGBT+ rights, which could include any form of advocacy, activism, or support. The bill has been met with international condemnation, with several countries and international organizations urging the Ghanaian government to reconsider the bill. In conclusion, LGBT+ rights in Ghana continue to be a contentious issue. The country’s conservative culture and the government’s position on the matter make it challenging for the LGBT+ community to demand their rights. However, the existence of organizations such as the LGBT+ Rights Ghana offers hope for the community, and with international support, there is a possibility for change in the future.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 66751816}

It was celebrated on the 19th day of the month of Thargelion (late May, in the Gregorian calendar), and was introduced in 429 BC.  The festival took place in the Piraeus.  It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens – six miles from the sanctuary – was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.  The horse race was followed by an all-night celebration, though the precise details of the remainder of the festival are unknown.\n\nReferences\n\nFestivals in ancient Athens\nGreek mythology\nMay observances\nJune observances", "machine_text": "Bendidia is a genus of moths in the family Noctuidae.

They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, with some species extending into temperate regions. The wingspan of Bendidia moths ranges from 18 to 36 millimeters.

Bendidia moths are important pollinators of some plant species. They are also important prey for a variety of predators, including birds, bats, and other insects. Despite their ecological importance, not much is known about the behavior and biology of Bendidia moths. Further research is needed to better understand their life cycle and role in the ecosystem.

Wolker's literary career began early, and he published his first book at the age of 17. He quickly made a name for himself as a promising young writer, and his poetry was noted for its emotional depth and sensitivity. Many of his works were influenced by his experiences growing up in a small town on the outskirts of Prague. In 1918, Wolker became involved in politics and joined the Czech Social Democratic Party. He worked as a journalist and editor for various newspapers and magazines, and his writings often dealt with the themes of social justice, equality, and democracy. Wolker's most famous work is his novel 'Mládí' (Youth), which he began writing in 1920. The novel is a semi-autobiographical account of his own experiences growing up in Prostějov and was a critical success upon its publication in 1921. Wolker's other notable works include the poetry collections 'Host do domu' (Guest in the House) and 'Proměna' (Transformation). Tragically, Wolker's promising career was cut short by his untimely death in 1924.

The Gatherin' is the third oldest continually broadcast radio program in America, and (since the 2007 cancellation of the WWVA Jamboree) the second-longest continually-running such program featuring country music; only the Grand Ole Opry (1925) and Music & the Spoken Word (1929) have been continually broadcast longer. (The CBS World News Roundup, which debuted in 1938, predates the Gatherin' but has not continually aired.)The Renfro Valley Gatherin' as of 2016 is now exclusively aired on RFDTV'S siriusxm radio channel 147 Rural Radio, Sunday nights at 9:30 pm eastern, and hosted by Scotty Bussell.\n\nFormat\n \nThe Gatherin'  program lasts a half-hour. The program begins with an opening hymn (sung by a choir, which includes audience members during live performances, accompanied by a reed organ), followed by an advertisement for upcoming events at the Renfro Valley Entertainment Center; this is followed by a listing of listeners' birthdays and anniversaries (limited to those 75 years or older or married 50 years or longer). The remainder of the program is themed, with the host reading short stories and monologues between folk, gospel and old-time country music performed by the show's house band. Most songs are vocal; an instrumental will sometimes close out the show. Other than the ad for the entertainment center, there are no commercials, nor is there any space for local stations to insert their own advertisements.\n\nPrior to 2011, the show was produced as a live stage performance. The current incarnation of the program is recorded entirely in a studio up to two months ahead of its air date and features studio recorded music, with almost all of it selected from a very limited playlist of approximately ten songs (most of which feature the host's wife, Pam Perry Combs, on lead vocals). The live version of the show is scheduled to return in May 2013.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Gatherin' program was founded by John Lair, former producer of the National Barn Dance, who founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance and what would become the Renfro Valley Entertainment Center around it in 1939.  The Gatherin''' was first broadcast via the CBS Radio Network in September 1943.  The Gatherin' was, and is, a thematic program.  The original concept of the show was to recreate the atmosphere of the pioneer \"getherin's\" which were held in Renfro Valley \"in the days of long ago.\"  At the start, CBS wanted a Sunday morning companion program to the popular Saturday night Renfro Valley Barn Dance which would not be strictly a religious program, but would fit the Sunday morning format of the time.  The \"Gatherin'\" was John Lair's answer to this.  During this time, both shows were headquartered at WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nJohn Lair was the first permanent emcee of the \"Gatherin',\" and there have so far only been three others; Grant Turner, Jim Gaskin, and Wayne Combs. Gaskin died on Saturday, May 3, 2008 at the age of 70 following a long illness. From then until approximately 2013, the Gatherin' was emceed by Wayne Combs, who is also an entertainer on the Barn Dance and other Renfro Valley shows, and a DJ at WRVK. For 2014 and 2015 episodes, Billy Keith hosted the show. The 2016 host is Scotty Bussell.\n\nAfter CBS Radio dropped the show at the end of the old-time radio era in 1957, a pre-recorded version of the Gatherin program went into syndication.  Meanwhile, a stage version of the show was, until approximately 2011, presented in the Old Barn Theater on Sunday mornings at 8:30.  The syndicated broadcast of the Gatherin''' is still heard on scores of stations across the United States and Canada, as well as on satellite radio and Internet broadcasts.  Following the departure of CBS, and former originating station WHAS of Louisville, from Renfro Valley in 1957, John Lair partnered with Tom Hargis to found WRVK in Renfro Valley, in part to serve as the Gatherin's and the Barn Dance's new flagship station, but mainly to serve the local listening audience in Rockcastle County, Kentucky.  The station first went on the air as a 500 watt daytime only AM station in April, 1957, utilizing the former WHAS/CBS studio in what was then the Pioneer Museum Building in Renfro Valley.\n\nRenfro Valley Entertainment Center\n\nRenfro Valley Entertainment Center, the home of the Gatherin' and Barn Dance, has been under separate ownership from WRVK since 1978.  At that time the radio station's then-owners, Cochran-Smith Broadcasting of Nashville, chose to move the studios, offices, and transmitter approximately one mile north of the entertainment center, to their present location on Red Foley Road.  (Cochran Smith's group of partners had leased the entire entertainment center from Lair in 1966, then exercised their option to buy it in 1968.  When they sold the facility back to Lair and his new partners, they kept ownership of WRVK, and moved it out of the Valley.).  WRVK is now a 1,200 watt station owned by Saylor Broadcasting, Inc. of Mt. Vernon, Kentucky.\n\nWRVK airs the Gatherin' on Saturdays at 6:25am. The Renfro Valley Entertainment Center currently lists WCYO/Irvine, Kentucky and WLXO/Stamping Ground, Kentucky as official radio stations, but neither station carries the Gatherin'.

In 1970, Gallery 200 was established as a permanent exhibition space within the newly constructed art building. In 1979, the Art Gallery moved to larger quarters in Swen Parson Hall and began to acquire a permanent collection. In 1990, the Swen Parson Art Gallery became a separate academic unit within the College of Visual and Performing Arts and its name was changed from \"gallery\" to \"museum\" to reflect its growing permanent collection. In 1991, the NIU Art Museum moved into the 5000 square-foot former auditorium in historic Altgeld Hall. This space was closed in December 1998 as Altgeld Hall was prepared to undergo a major renovation project. The Art Museum reopened in 2004 in the remodeled Altgeld Galleries.\n\nDuring the renovation, the NIU Art Museum offices moved to a temporary site off campus where the Museum staff oversaw its Museum without Walls program. While its main gallery was closed, the Art Museum collaborated with artists and local community ‘Partners in Art’ in the development, design and production of contemporary art installations, events and projects at various locations within the greater DeKalb area.\n\nThe NIU Chicago Gallery was founded in 1985 as an outreach unit located in Chicago’s River North gallery district. In this space, the Museum presented contemporary conceptual and installation art as well as the work of NIU faculty and students. In June 2006, facing tightening state funds, the Museum and University administration closed the NIU Chicago Gallery and reallocated resources supporting that space to the College.\n\nThe Jack Olson Memorial Gallery (formerly Gallery 200) generally shows two professional art exhibitions per year and six student group art exhibitions. The Gallery was renamed in 1996 to honor art professor and past gallery director Charles “Jack” Olson who taught at NIU from 1969 until 1994. The Olson Gallery was administered by NIU Art Museum staff from 1995 - 2004. Now, the Olson Gallery is run exclusively by the School of Art at NIU.\n\nCommunity School of Arts \nThe NIU Community School of the Arts is an outreach program of the NIU of Visual and Performing Arts.\n\nHuskie Marching Band\nThe NIU Huskie Marching Band performs at all university home football games, at select away games, and at post-season bowl games.
