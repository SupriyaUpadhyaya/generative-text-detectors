Billerbeck was born in 1967 in Solingen, Germany. He was sentenced to five years in prison for attempted murder in 1994, and to life in prison for murder in 1998. Billerbeck's victims were all young women, most of them trainees or students. He strangled them after a period of stalking, and then posed their bodies in a sexual manner. He always chose his victims from a large distance, and never used his real name. His first murder was in 1996, and his last one was in 1997. In October 1998, Billerbeck was arrested after a woman he had been stalking escaped and notified the police. He confessed to the five murders after being presented with a psychological profile prepared by the police. He showed no remorse, and claimed that he had only killed women who \"deserved\" to be killed. Billerbeck was sentenced to life in prison for the five murders, as well as to a term of ten years in prison for attempted murder. He will be eligible for parole in 2036, when he will be 69 years old.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Adult/Child\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Adult/Child (sometimes typeset as Adult Child) is an unreleased studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, intended to follow the group's 1977 The Beach Boys Love You. Like The Beach Boys Love You, it is virtually a Brian Wilson solo project with other group members serving mainly as additional vocalists. After it was rejected by Reprise Records, the band released the 1978 M.I.U. Album in its place with an almost entirely revamped song list. A few projected tracks for Adult Child were eventually released on later albums and compilations. Currently, the album is available only as a bootleg recording.\n\nStylus Magazine tersely summarizes the work: \"Brian’s Sinatra album. Vegas big band arrangements, brassy cover tunes, a few songs written with the hopes that the Chairman himself might sing them. The label heard it and probably rejected it before track 2 began.\" Amid its status as an esoteric non-release within the Beach Boys catalog, the album has developed a mild cult following among fans and musicians.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1977, plans were made for a Beach Boys album composed entirely of outtakes recorded during 1976 sessions for 15 Big Ones (1976) and The Beach Boys Love You (1977) partnered with material originating as far back as 1965. After the release of Love You, the Beach Boys fell into dispute over the direction of the band, and were close to breaking up. Intended as a follow-up to Love You, sessions and mixing for a new album entitled Adult Child were completed by the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson acting as producer.\n\nSimilarly with \"Good Time\" on The Beach Boys Love You, a few Adult Child tracks were outtakes sourced from earlier Beach Boys albums. Sessions for the album were kickstarted on January 19, 1977, only five days after the assembly for Love You was completed. Concurrently, Dennis Wilson worked on his solo album Pacific Ocean Blue which would see release in September 1977. According to Stan Love, the band's manager and younger brother of the Beach Boys' Mike Love, when Mike heard the rough demo recordings of Adult/Child replete with big band swing arrangements, he turned to Brian and asked: \"What the fuck are you doing?\" While projected for release in autumn 1977, the album was rejected by Reprise Records for not being commercially viable.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nBrian composes, writes, and sings most of Adult/Child with Carl and Dennis Wilson swapping lead vocals. Exceptionally, Brian included the group's cover versions of \"Deep Purple\", \"On Broadway\", and the traditional folk standard \"Shortenin' Bread\", the last of which he had been obsessed with for several years. Dick Reynolds was commissioned for the arrangement of four tracks. Reynolds had arranged strings for The Beach Boys' Christmas Album, and for Brian's idols the Four Freshmen and Frank Sinatra in 1964.\n\nThe album's lyrics mostly reflect the minutiae of Brian's life during the 1970s. Some songs center around physical fitness, eating healthy, and ecology. Describing \"Hey Little Tomboy\", a leftover from Love You, Brian said, \"It's about a little girl who is sort of a rough neck, and this guy convinces her to become a pretty girl, and sure enough she slowly turns into a pretty—she starts shaving her legs and wearing short sticks—puts lipstick on and makeup. So she's a little tomboy. ... We're very happy with it.\" Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that \"[the song] reveled uncomfortably in an adolescent girl who is putting away her skateboard and baseball mitt in order to get hot and heavy with the swain portrayed by Mike. ... [it] may be the most unsettling moment in the entire recorded history of the Beach Boys.\"\n\nIn line with the group's two previous albums, it was also slated to include a couple of older outtakes: \"H.E.L.P. Is On the Way\" from the Surf's Up sessions and \"Games Two Can Play\" from the Sunflower sessions.\n\nAvailability\nThe album has been released through numerous bootlegs, but is officially unavailable. \"Hey Little Tomboy\" appears in a slightly revised form on M.I.U. Album. \"Shortenin' Bread\", a traditional folk song with which Brian was reportedly obsessed at the time, was revised and placed on L.A. (Light Album) (1979). \"H.E.L.P. Is On the Way,\" \"Games Two Can Play,\" \"It's Over Now,\" and \"Still I Dream of It\" were released on the group's box set Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys (1993). An alternate piano demo of \"Still I Dream of It\" was included on Brian Wilson's solo album I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995).\n\nReception\n\nMusicologist Philip Lambert believes, \"All of the songs from this collection are solid efforts, but 'Still I Dream of It' and 'It's Over Now' are particularly inspired and rank right up there with Brian's best work,\" calling them \"gut-wrenching ballads about romance and heartbreak.\" Scram—a fanzine devoted to esoteric works—said: \"There are so-called Beach Boys fans who say anybody who applaud Love You and this album is being ironic. I say fuck those tight-arsed naysayers! Both of those albums showcase a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\" Stylus Magazine included the album in a list entitled \"'Long Time Gone' – The Classic Rock Lost Album Archetypes\" among other Beach Boys' non-releases such as Smile, Landlocked, and Bambu as \"A Lost Album Category Unto Themselves\". The journal wrote:\n{{quote|\"If 'legend' means 'an unreleased masterwork from the genius who brought us Pet Sounds''' then no. But for Brian fanatics, Adult Child is a must-hear, even if it does chronicle the decline of what was arguably pop’s greatest talent ... nearly every song reflects the sorry state in which the elder-Wilson found himself by the late-Seventies: a drug-addled, paranoid shut-in, weighing in at a none-too-svelte 300 lbs. As morbidly awful as that proposition sounds, however, Wilson’s melodic sense, arranging skills and humor had not yet totally abandoned him by 1977 — even if his choirboy voice, ravaged by a four-pack-a-day cigarette habit, had.\"}}\n\nIn 2000, a cover of \"Lines\" was recorded by Duglas T. Stewart of indie pop band BMX Bandits for the various artists tribute album Caroline Now!. BMX Bandits recorded a version of \"Hey Little Tomboy\" with Pearlfishers. \"Still I Dream of It\" has been covered by Ed Harcourt, Jimmy Nail, and Carice van Houten. \"Life Is for the Living\" was recorded and released by the Easy Goings in 1992, and performed live in 2015 by Neil Hamburger at Festival Supreme.\n\nTrack listingAdult Child'' was mixed and assembled in the following sequence on June 27, 1977, \"It's Trying to Say\" is also known as \"Baseball's On\". For bootlegs, some editions include additional recordings made by the group between the 1960s and 1980s.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n \n\nThe Beach Boys bootleg recordings\nAlbums produced by Brian Wilson\nUnreleased albums\nBig band albums\n1977 albums", "machine_text": " Adult/child This article is about the adult/child relationship.

Karlweis abandoned his youthful law studies for the stage, first for eight years at Vienna's Stadttheater. After service in World War I, he was active with Max Reinhardt's Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, followed by engagements at various theaters in Munich and Vienna, and then to the Berlin stage where he had a popular following playing singing and dancing roles, including as Prinz Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus.  His general manner was humorous, charming, naive, and cheerful.\n\nIn Berlin between 1930 and 1933 he worked as a recording artist and acted in more than a dozen German light comedy and musical films, most famously as one of Lilian Harvey's suitors in the hugely successful operetta film The Three from the Filling Station.\n\nWith Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Karlweis, who was Jewish, returned to the Austrian stage; but with the Nazi Anschluss in 1938 he was again forced to flee, first to Switzerland and then Paris where, at both locations, he took to the stage with fellow Austrian law school dropout, writer/director, and cabaret performer Karl Farkas. When German forces took Paris in 1940, Karlweis, along with his friend Austrian writer Friedrich Torberg, fled via Spain to Portugal, whence they made their way to New York.\n\nNot knowing English, Karlweis was at first limited to acting in German emmigré  productions, but he soon got his English legs and appeared in eight Broadway shows in the early 1940s, including the title role in Franz Werfel's long-running \"Jacobowsky and the Colonel,\" garnering outstanding reviews.\n\nIn the early 1950s Karlweis played supporting roles in TV productions and in several Hollywood and European films.  He died in 1956 of a heart attack in New York, and is interred at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery in Vienna.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1946, Karlweis married theatrical and film producer Ninon Tallon, the niece of three-time Prime Minister of France Édouard Herriot.

Her first tryst with writing was in school when she won a national short story writing competition. In her high school in Vellore, Ida Scudder School, she wrote a musical for the annual play production, finding it easier to write one than to find an appropriate play in the library as her principal had initially suggested.\n\nShe graduated from Women's Christian College, Chennai. It was here that she began to explore this gift further…being an all women's college, they had no male actors and so she wrote a play titled Seven for a Secret that had an all-women cast. It went on to win the Best Script prize and the Best Audience Response at an inter-collegiate theatre festival.\n\nShe worked as a reporter in Bangalore doing food and play reviews. She then did an MA in English Literature at the University of Madras. She worked as a copywriter and then as a technical writer.\n\nLife as a playwright\n\nWhen she scribbled her first script on the back of a notebook in school, it was simply her idea of what she thought a play should look like. Yet, she says, the form came naturally. \nShe wrote her second full length script while studying at Women's Christian College. But she learnt the fundamentals of playwriting during a workshop by Mahesh Dattani and was later trained by the Royal Court Theatre in London.She says about her experience in her interview with 'The Hindu' \"I learnt how drama is action. Cause and effect. Your left brain and right brain have to work together.”\n \nIn WCC she had to write a play with no male actors in it. So she wrote a play with 7 girls in it titled \"Seven for a Secret \"and it was this play that got her into a workshop with the Royal Court Theatre, London. The play was performed in Chennai and it won the Best Script prize and Best Audience Response prize.\nShe participated in a playwriting workshop by Mahesh Dattani and the play she wrote at the end of this titled 'Only Women' had a rehearsed reading at the British Council.\n\nShe also wrote a monologue titled 'We are Water' that was aired on BBC radio in Sept 2003.\n\nAfter taking up various other jobs, she realised that her passion was in theatre, especially writing scripts.\nSo she approached the Royal Court Theatre again. This time she sent them a play that she had been working on. It was the original draft of 'The Long Way Home'. 'The Long Way Home', found its way to the country's most prestigious stages, from NCPA and Prithvi in Mumbai to the Museum Theatre in Chennai, last year. She had become a mother by then, and so she explored the dynamics between a mother and daughter.\" The play evolved as she realised her strength was dialogue.\n\nThe play 'The Long Way Home' was produced and staged by Evam entertainment and directed by Karthik Kumar. It starred the talented dancer-actor Anita Ratnam. The role was so authentic that every performance ended with people walking up to her and saying, \"You're just like my mom\".\nThe play was shown in Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Shekinah says, \"I realized that even if I'm writing about the small world I know, a domineering south Indian mother isn't too different from a mother at the other end of the world. As playwrights we have to fall in love with creating believable characters.\"\n\nHer biggest and most acclaimed work till date has been the hugely successful \"Ali J\".\n\nAli J began with a real story. Her brother is a lawyer who works with a human rights organisation in Mumbai. He told her about a young man who was imprisoned because drugs were planted in his bag. The man spent 10 years in a Mauritius prison, and then was moved to Mumbai. He's still in prison.\nAround the same time, evam asked her to write them a monologue for 'The Fringe'. \"They originally wanted one on Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and realizing how little Indian history she knew, she began to read extensively on the subject.\" After six months of reading, she decided to morph the two subjects. \"The actual writing took just as long as it took her to type.”\n\nAli J, produced by evam entertainment premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews and a four star review from The Scotsman. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nThe story works on two levels. It's about a guy in his 30s imprisoned in a cell in Chennai who is on death row for a crime he did not commit. It's about how circumstances and people shape his vision. She adds, \"The point is to capture the idea that a single event can change the course of your life. All of us are acted on by so many influences – childhood, love, jealousy…. Great historical figures were no different. Their decisions are so influenced by personal egos, ambitions, and little distractions.\n\nAli J by evam premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country.\n\nTalking about her inspiration in her interview with \"The Indian Express\" on 25 October 2013 Jacob says, \"I read as widely as possible– my favorite playwrights include Alan Bennet for the brilliant way in which he captures miniature shifts of mood and the textured dynamics of relationships, also Tom Stoppard and David Mamet. And of course the immortal Shakespeare,\" she says. According to Jacob, good theatre is like a good democracy, 'by the people, of the people, and for the people'. She writes what she would like to watch as an audience. She enjoys watching plays that are rooted in her world. Theatre should be like an ongoing dialogue between the audience and the actors.\n\nShekinah Jacob began her own theatre group called Open House Productions, mainly to combine her two loves- entertaining, thought-provoking theatre that also generates income for charitable causes. The uniqueness of this theatre company is that operates on a Robin Hood model, funded by corporates and well-wishers, while most of the revenue from ticket sales go to deserving local NGOs in every locality that they perform in.\n\nOpen House Productions feel that artists should be rewarded for their time and talent and they try to pay every performer as generously as possible. \nIn an interview in 2015, playwright Naren Weiss told India-West that his play Censored came to him after Jacob's Ali J had been banned in multiple cities across India. The play was later shot as a sketch by the Stray Factory and went viral in India.\n\nTwo years ago Shekinah Jacob won the Charles Wallace Scholarship and acquired a Masters in Writing for Performance with a Distinction at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her course and exposure to cutting-edge theatre on London's stages was a huge learning experience and she has brought all of that back to the second innings of Open House Theatre Productions that was on a brief break during her years in the U.K. They are now back with The Christmas Shootout, a comedy for the festive season, beginning a national tour in December 2016 in all the four metros. They are also going international this year with an eighth show in Dubai, to reach a total audience of over 5500 people.\n\nPlay Ali J\nPart Bollywood romance, part social commentary on the after-effects of the partitioning of India, this perfectly pitched play by Shekinah Jacob, produced by Evam Theatre, never lets the weighty issues it tackles overshadow a heartfelt personal story. The writing is rich with humour and humanity, and TK Karthik's engaging performance brings Ali's warm and welcoming character to life.\n\nThe Scotsman  – \"Hot show pick...\" 4 stars\n\nThe play is both heartfelt and cerebral as it paints a picture of an India still living in the wake of brutal partition following independence, simultaneously telling the story of one man and millions of people. The writing is never simplistic but always open, and uttered with a joy of life that can only come to those facing death.

Actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst reprised their roles as Del Boy and Rodney in the sketch written by Jim Sullivan and Dan Sullivan; the script included previously unused material written by their father John Sullivan, who created and wrote every episode of the series. David Beckham guest starred,  Beckham having got in touch with Jim Sullivan.\n\nAccording to Shazam Productions there was a lot of interest in the sketch. The return of Only Fools and Horses was eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981 until 2003.\n\nThis special sketch was dedicated to the memory of John Sullivan and Roger Lloyd-Pack, who had both died prior to its broadcast.\n\nSynopsis \nAn unspecified amount of time after the series' last regular episode \"Sleepless in Peckham,\" Del Boy is in Peckham market, trying to sell \"Golden Balls\" underpants which are supposedly endorsed and signed by David Beckham (in return for Del Boy securing a bouncy castle for the birthday party of one of Beckham's son's, Brooklyn, who Del incorrectly calls Brookside), with Rodney serving as a less-than-enthusiastic model. After failing to sell anything, the Trotters retreat to a nearby cafe, where Rodney complains about Del's treatment of him. Del apologises, mentioning several incidents where he had mistreated Rodney. (These being incidents from previous regular Only Fools and Horses episodes.) Sharing the table with the two is David Beckham, who it turns out actually has endorsed the underpants. The three briefly chat, including Rodney and Beckham discussing their favourite artist (Rodney choosing Matisse, and Beckham choosing Tony Hart), before Beckham gives Rodney tips on how to model underwear effectively, advising him to \"glide\" and \"oscillate.\"\n\nLater on, Del is again trying to sell the underpants, with Rodney putting on a bizarre, vaguely feminine walk, and being even more angry at Del than he was before, telling him \"Derek, I'm going to kill you\". Beckham is discreetly watching this, when a young boy walks up to him, and asks him if he's David Beckham. He says that he is, and signs the boy's football, but says not to tell anyone he is there, as he does not want to draw anymore attention to himself. Beckham then attempts to lean back on a goods cart, but a trader moves it away while he isn't looking and he falls to the ground (referencing a famous moment in the episode \"Yuppy Love\"), getting the attention of everyone in the market. Del and Rodney comment, \"What a plonker!\"\n\nCast\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Sport Relief TV revealed\n Only Fools and Horses sketch to appear on Sport Relief\n Sport Relief 2014: David Beckham in Only Fools and Horses\n Only Fools and Horses to return with new sketch for Sport Relief\n\n2014 British television episodes\n2014 in British sport\nOnly Fools and Horses special episodes\nSport Relief", "machine_text": " Beckham in Peckham The area of Peckham in South London is renowned for its association with football. In the early 20th century, three of the dominant teams in the area were based in Peckham, with two of them, Nunhead and Peckham Town, both playing in the Southern League. The most successful team based in Peckham, and the only one to have progressed to the highest level of English football, was Crystal Palace, who played at the now-demolished Crystal Palace Stadium from 1917 until their relocation to Selhurst Park in South Norwood in 1924. In the 1960s, the area became the home of the most successful team in the country, as England's World Cup winners lived in the area. Manager Alf Ramsey, and players Jimmy Greaves, Ron Springett, George Eastham, Ron Springett, Ron Greenwood, Norman Hunter, Terry Paine, Ron Springett, and Alan Ball all lived in the area. The most famous footballing family in the country, the Beckhams, lived in the area for many years. The family patriarch, Ted Beckham, moved to Peckham in the 1950s, and his sons, Bobby, Ron, and Jack, all grew up in the area. The three brothers were all professional footballers, and Jack and Ron also became managers. The most famous of the three, Bobby Beckham, is regarded as one of the greatest British players of all time. He spent the majority of his career at Manchester United, where he won the European Cup, and also played for the England national team. After retiring from football, he became a football manager, and also worked as a football commentator. In the 1990s, the area was the home of another of the country's most successful teams, as Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup while based at nearby Highbury. The area is also home to a number of non-league teams, including Peckham Town, who currently play in the Southern Counties East League, and Dulwich Hamlet, who play in the Isthmian League.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 42073739}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ice cream\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.  Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below ). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\n\nThe meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another.\n Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk.\n Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir.\n Frozen custard, with eggs added to cream and sugar.\n Ice milk.\n Sorbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base. Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea.\n Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,  almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\n\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history.\nSome sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine. Although sorbets are believed to have been invented in Persia, other accounts say ice cream originated in the Mongol Empire and first spread to China during its expansion.\n\nIts spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Arab traders, but more often to Marco Polo. Though it's not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of it during his travels to China. The Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici is said to have introduced flavored sorbet ices to France when she brought some Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the \"frozen snow\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support any of these legends.\n\nSnow was used to cool drinks in Greece around 500 BC and Hippocrates is known to have criticized chilled drinks for causing \"fluxes of the stomach\". Snow collected from the lower slopes of mountains was unsanitary and iced drinks were believed to cause convulsions, colic and a host of other ailments. Seneca criticized the extravagant costs associated with iced desserts in an era without refrigeration.\n\nDespite this, ice and snow were prized ingredients in ancient cuisines including Japanese, Chinese, Greek and Roman cuisines. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice. There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour, camphor and water buffalo milk and recipes for snow-chilled sweets are included in a 1st-century Roman recipe book. There are Persian records from the 2nd century AD for sweetened chilled drinks with ice made by freezing water in the desert at night.\n\nIce cream was made possible only by the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could only be chilled but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that lowered the melting point of ice, which had the effect of drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze. The first known record of this comes from the Indian poem Pancatantra, dating to the 4th century AD. The earliest written description of the process is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Ibn Abu Usaybia concerning medicine. The technique of \"freezing\" is not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.\n\nSouth Asia \n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital Delhi. The ice was used in fruit sorbets. It was also used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\"\n\nEurope \n\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.\n\nIce cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century. The recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718.\n\nTo ice cream.\n\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten’d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and  lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou’d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten’d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\n\nThe 1751 edition of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse includes a recipe for ice cream: \"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\"\n\nThe year 1768 saw the publication of L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.\n\nNorth America \n\nAn early North American reference to ice cream is from 1744: \"Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.\"\n\nQuaker colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18-step recipe for ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.\n\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.\n\nThe most popular flavours of ice cream in North America (based on consumer surveys) are vanilla and chocolate.\n\nExpansion in popularity \nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-eighteenth century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss émigré Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\n\nIn New Zealand, a newspaper advertisement for ice cream appeared in 1866, claiming to be the first time ice cream was available in Wellington. Commercial manufacturing was underway in 1875. Ice cream rapidly gained in popularity in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. By 2018, exported ice cream products included new flavors such as “matcha” to cater specifically to Asian markets.\n\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \"queen of ices\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books:  The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\n\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\n\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery of 1888. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\". The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\n\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors\", and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.\n\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \"premium\" and \"super-premium\" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and Häagen-Dazs.\n\nComposition \nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture. Too much lactose will result in a non ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.\n\nProduction \n\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a  (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\n\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\n\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings. It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of  cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.\n\nRetail sales \n\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, the US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.\n\nSpecialty job \n\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"ice cream trucks\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"Turkey in the Straw\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\n\nIngredients and standard quality definitions \n\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\n\nIn the U.S., the FDA rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:\n greater than 10% milk fat\n 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk\n\nIt generally also has:\n 12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners\n 0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers\n 55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.\n\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.\nEven the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains  per half-cup due to its high sugar content.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, ice cream in Canada is divided into  Ice cream mix and Ice cream. Each have a different set of regulations.\n Ice cream must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per litre. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.\n The ice cream mix is defined as the pasteurized mix of cream, milk and other milk products that are not yet frozen. It may contain eggs, artificial or non-artificial flavours, cocoa or chocolate syrup, a food colour, an agent that adjusts the pH level in the mix, salt, a stabilizing agent that doesn't exceed 0.5% of the ice cream mix, a sequestering agent which preserves the food colour, edible casein that doesn't exceed 1% of the mix, propylene glycol mono fatty acids in an amount that will not exceed 0.35% of the ice cream mix, and sorbitan tristearate in an amount that will not exceed 0.035% of the mix. The ice cream mix may not include less than 36% solid components.\n\nPhysical properties \n\nIce cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.\n\nOstwald ripening \n\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\n\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).\n\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.\n\nFood safety concerns \nFrom the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases, weight gain, and other metabolic syndromes.\n\nAround the world \n\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\n\nThe most traditional Argentine helado (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.\n\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year.\n\nIn China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.\n\nIn 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafés opened in Paris.\n\nIn Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or pagotó (), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIndia is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.\n\nIn Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called es puter or \"stirred ice cream\" is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar—and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.\n\nIn Iran, fālūde (Persian: فالوده) or pālūde (Persian: پالوده) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.\n\nItalian ice cream, or gelato as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \"produzione propria\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\n\nSorbetes is a Philippine version of common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name sorbetes and sorbet, sorbetes is not a type of sorbet.\n\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many cafés or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafés may also sell flavours like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu.\n\nDondurma is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).\n\nIn the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \"Philadelphia style\" ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \"French ice cream\". American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year—the most in the world.\n\nCones \n\nMrs A.B.Marshall's Cookery Book, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones, but the idea predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\n\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.\n\nOther frozen desserts \n\nThe following is a partial list of ice creamy frozen desserts and snacks:\n\n Ais kacang: a dessert in Malaysia and Singapore made from shaved ice, syrup, and boiled red bean and topped with evaporated milk\n Booza: an elastic, sticky, high-level melt resistant ice cream\n Dondurma: Turkish ice cream, made of salep and mastic resin\n Frozen custard: at least 10% milk fat, at least 1.4% egg yolk and much less air beaten into it, similar to Gelato, fairly rare; known in Italy as Semifreddo\n Frozen yogurt: made with yogurt instead of milk or cream, it has a tart flavour and lower fat content\n Gelato: an Italian frozen dessert having a lower milk fat content than ice cream\n Halo-halo: a popular Filipino dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a tall glass or bowl\n Ice cream sandwich: two (usually) soft biscuits, cookies or cake sandwiching a bar of ice cream\n Ice milk: less than 10% milk fat and lower sweetening content, once marketed as \"ice milk\" but now sold as low-fat ice cream in the United States\n Ice pop or ice lolly: frozen fruit puree, fruit juice, or flavoured sugar water on a stick or in a flexible plastic sleeve\n Kulfi: believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent during Mughal India\n Maple toffee: Also known as maple taffy. A popular springtime treat in maple-growing areas is maple toffee, where maple syrup boiled to a concentrated state is poured over fresh snow congealing in a toffee-like mass, and then eaten from a wooden stick used to pick it up from the snow\n Mellorine: non-dairy, with vegetable fat substituted for milk fat\n Parevine: Kosher non-dairy frozen dessert established in 1969 in New York\n Patbingsu: A popular Korean shaved ice dessert commonly served with sweet toppings such as fruit, red bean, or sweetened condensed milk\n Sherbet: 1–2% milk fat and sweeter than ice cream\n Sorbet: fruit puree with no dairy products\n Snow cones: made from balls of crushed ice topped with flavoured syrup served in a paper cone\n\nCryogenics \n\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.\n\nSee also \n\n Cold-stimulus headache\n Ice cream social\n List of dairy products\n List of desserts\n List of ice cream brands\n List of ice cream flavors\n Milkshake (a blended mix of ice cream, milk and syrups)\n Nancy Maria Donaldson Johnson\n Soft serve\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n How It's Made: UConn Dairy Bar Ice Cream\n Selected Internet Resources – Ice Cream / Science Reference Section, Library of Congress\n\n \nDairy products\nDesserts\nTypes of food\nFrozen desserts\nWorld cuisine\nIndependence Day (United States) foods", "machine_text": " Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. Since the nineteenth century, ice cream has been a popular food, particularly in the summer months. The meaning of the phrase \"ice cream\" varies by region. In some areas, it is used to describe any frozen dessert that is not made from milk, such as ice pops or fruit popsicles, while in others, it is limited to soft-serve ice cream. Ice cream is usually made from dairy products, such as milk, cream, and butterfat. The dairy product is typically mixed with sugar, milk solids, and other ingredients. The mixture is then pasteurized and homogenized. After this, it is cooled and aged for a period of time. During aging, the fat molecules form a network structure. This structure gives ice cream its smooth, creamy texture. The mixture is then churned to incorporate air. This process, called overrun, gives ice cream its light and fluffy texture. The overrun is typically between 30 and 50 percent. The finished ice cream is then packed and frozen. It is typically sold in individual containers, such as cones, cups, or sandwiches, or in larger containers, such as pints or gallons. Ice cream can be served plain, or with a variety of toppings, such as chocolate chips, nuts, and whipped cream. It is also used in some desserts, such as ice cream cake. In the United States, ice cream is the most popular dessert, with more than 90 percent of homes having ice cream in their freezer. It is also popular in other parts of the world, such as Europe, Asia, and South America. The first frozen dessert that is similar to ice cream was probably made in China more than 2,500 years ago. The dish, called kak Bingham, was a mixture of frozen milk and rice. The first ice cream that is similar to what we know today was probably made in the Italian Renaissance. The dish, called sherbet, was a mixture of frozen fruit and ice. The first ice cream that was made with milk was probably made in France in the 17th century. The dish, called ice cream, was a mixture of frozen milk and cream. In the United States, the first ice cream parlor opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1840. The parlor was owned by Edward M. Blaney, and it was called the Knickerbocker Ice Cream Company. Ice cream became popular in the United States in the 19th century. It was first sold by street vendors, but soon after, it was sold in parlors and shops. The ice cream industry in the United States is a $5 billion industry, with more than 10,000 ice cream parlors and shops. The most popular flavors of ice cream in the United States are vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Jemaah Tarbiyah\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Jemaah Tarbiyah, also known as the Tarbiyah movement or the Dakwah movement, is an Islamic religious movement based in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah was an active movement during the 1980s to 1990s and consisted of university students, aimed at the religious education and da'wah (proselytizing). The movement is considered to be influenced by the teaching of Muslim Brotherhood. It is considered an important influence for Islamization of Indonesia. The movement became the bedrock of the Islamist party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) which was founded in 2002.\n\nEtymology\nThe term tarbiyah () means \"intensive Islamic education\" or \"disciplining\" in Arabic. Initially, the term was mainly used by outsiders to designate the particular phenomenon and activities conducted by certain groups. There has been no formal consensus on the naming by the activists of the movement. Tarbiyah is often used by Indonesian Islamic higher educational institutions as a name of faculties specialized in religious education. The term was also used by a socio-religious organization Union of Islamic Education (Persatuan Tarbiyah Islam, PERTI) established in 1928. The usage of tarbiyah in the context of Jemaah Tarbiyah has no direct relations with any of the latter.\n\nHistory\nThere had been a history of da'wah based on university campuses, notably of elite secular universities such as Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) since the 1970s. However, there was a demand for more comprehensive and systematic methods of da'wah, which was still very informal and strictly monitored by the Suharto regime. Some religious gatherings based in Salman Mosque of ITB is considered one of many origins of Jemaah Tarbiyah. These religious gatherings put particular emphasis on specific attitudes toward basic Islamic teachings and interpretations, including the principle of ukhuwah (brotherhood), dress code, and the prohibition on smoking.\n\nAmong the activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah, four Muslim students returned from the Islamic University of Madinah, Hilmi Aminuddin, Salim Segaf Aljufri, Abdullah Said Baharmus, and Acep Abdul Syukur, are considered founding fathers (collectively called muassis). Facing demands of more systematic proselytization and religious education, these four students and their cohorts have articulated a comprehensive program and organized activities, improved with methodology from the Middle East which was often named as usrah system. Its religious gatherings were known as halaqah which involved mentoring and Qur'anic recitations. Since early to mid-1980s, the activity had quickly spread across elite secular universities, where religious education was required to be complemented.\n\nJemaah Tarbiyah has often been pointed out of its Muslim Brotherhood influence. Usrah system was a training program of Muslim Brotherhood members, and the Tarbiyah movement had directly implemented the methodology. Activists of the Tarbiyah movement are also considered to be committed toward translation of books written by members of Muslim Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb. There is also an explanation that links Jemaah Tarbiyah to the Indonesian Islamic Dawaah Council (DDII), a conservative Islamic organization headed by Mohammad Natsir. DDII had contributed to the constructions of mosques in the universities and was central to the importation of religious teachings from the Middle East. Some of the prominent activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah had DDII backgrounds.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Jemaah Tarbiyah had managed to grow its influence underground, mostly due to its focus on religious issues and avoided political activism. The movement had also established formal institutions with similar aims but without explicit reference toward its connections. Such institutions include foundations like Nurul Fikri, Al-Hikmah Boarding School, and PA-HAM. In the 1990s, the movement had established influence over many intra-university student organizations and discussion forums. The movement accommodated various Islamic religious strands from traditionalist to modernists, and was fluid regarding pragmatic concerns such as political system.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the democratic transition, activists of the movement founded an Islamist political party Justice Party (PK) in 1998, and its successor Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in 2002. Majority of the members of PK and PKS, including the first president of PK Nurmahmudi Ismail, were activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah. The establishment of a political party was chosen over the establishment of a formal socio-religious organization. The decision was supported by the majority of the activists. Main activities related to da'wah conducted during the Jemaah Tarbiyah era were succeeded by the political parties. Today, activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah have been continuously influencing the creation of new trends in da'wah and Islamic socio-religious movements, including One Day One Juz (ODOJ).\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\nDamanik, A.S.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sobibór Museum\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Sobibór Museum, or the Museum of the Former Sobibór Nazi Death Camp (), is a Polish state-owned museum devoted to memorializing the victims and atrocities committed at the former Sobibor extermination camp, located on the outskirts of Sobibór near Lublin. The Nazi German death camp was set up in occupied Poland during World War II, as part of the Jewish extermination program known as the Operation Reinhard, which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland. The camp was run by the SS Sonderkommando Sobibor, initially commanded by Franz Stangl. The number of Jews from Poland and elsewhere who were gassed and cremated there between April 1942 and October 14, 1943, is estimated at 250,000; possibly more, including those who were transported from other Reich-occupied countries.\n\nSince May 1, 2012, the Sobibór Museum has been managed as a branch of the Majdanek State Museum, dedicated to the history and commemoration of the Holocaust camps and subcamps of KL Lublin. Originally, the museum served as a branch of the district museum in nearby Włodawa, founded in 1981. The museum was temporarily closed to the public from April 2011 to May 2013 due to lack of funds. The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage reopened the Museum with additional funding after its administrative reorganisation.\n\nArchaeological and conservation work was conducted at the site between 2007 and 2017, revealing formerly buried features of the camp and thousands of items belonging to the victims. The mass grave site was covered with geotextile and crushed marble in 2017. In 2020, a new Museum and Memorial in Sobibór was inaugurated, with 323-square meters of exhibition space, displaying a permanent exhibition artifacts, photographs and documents.\n\nMuseum history\n\nBecause the Nazis had closed and destroyed the camp in late 1943, replanting the site to hide the evidence of what had taken place, little was known about the camp for years. The Sobibor trial in Hagen, Germany, and the parallel Hiwi, or Trawniki trials in Krasnodar in the former USSR brought publicity to the Nazi-directed activities at this death camp. These trials were inspired by the investigative work of Simon Wiesenthal, and the highly publicized capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 from Argentina by the Israeli Mossad, to stand trial in Jerusalem.\n\nMost Holocaust survivors had left Poland long before these events, and few from the camp are known to have survived the war. The camp was largely forgotten.\n\nThe first monument to Sobibór victims was erected in 1965 on the historic site. The Włodawa Museum, which commissioned the monument, established a separate Sobibór branch on October 14, 1993, on the 50th anniversary of the armed uprising of Jewish prisoners there. After some 300 prisoners escaped in 1943, the Nazis closed and destroyed the camp to try to hide the evidence of the mass killings. Only 58 of those former prisoners are known to have survived the war.\n\nThe small museum was scheduled to be replaced with a modern visitor centre, with a design chosen from an international design competition in 2013, sponsored by the Polish-German Foundation Pojednanie. On June 24, 2014, the State Secretary from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage presented the winning design at a ceremony in Warsaw. Attending were the King of the Netherlands Willem Alexander and his wife Queen Máxima, partners in the project along with Israel, Poland, and Slovakia. After parts of the former camp grounds were excavated by archeologists and the field of mass graves covered with geotextile and crushed marble, construction work on the new museum complex began in 2017.\n\nThe permanent exhibition of the new Museum and Memorial in Sobibór was inaugurated on October 29, 2020, with 323 square meters of exhibition space. Over 700 personal items belonging to the victims of the camp, from among 11,000 artifacts held by the museum, as well as documents and photographs, form the centerpiece of the exhibition. Sixteen thematic areas explain the history of the extermination camp and the Holocaust in occupied Poland.\n\nResearch and conservation programs\n\nThe Museum complex comprises a building, archives, and monuments. The museum building is located near the former railway station; these are connected by a paved Trail of Memory. Memorial monuments include a cast-iron statue of a woman with child, sculpted by Mieczysław Welter. It is installed on the former \"Road to Heaven\" (Himmelfahrtstrasse). In addition, a large circular enclosure has a mound of ashes and crushed bones of the victims, collected at the site and formed into a broad pyramid next to the original open-air cremation pits. A local archive of the facsimiles of testimonies and pertinent documents is available at the museum.\n\nThe camp is scheduled to undergo more advanced geophysical studies and further archaeological excavations to explore the site. Practically no fixed objects of any kind are found within the site, since the SS meticulously removed as much evidence as possible. Any research work around and near the graves is conducted under the strict supervision of the Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich.\n\nThe first excavation project was completed in October 2007. More than one thousand items belonging to the victims were unearthed. In October 2009, the second excavation phase was conducted, which determined the exact placement of double-row barbed-wire fencing posts around the camp. The work revealed numerous new artifacts as well, including false teeth, keepsakes from Marienbad, and many suitcase keys.  In the autumn of 2012, the north-western section around mass graves 1 and 2 was analyzed. Geophysical  evidence was found of the barbed-wire enclosure that separated mass graves and cremation pits from the living area of Camp III, and that marked the perimeter of the killing zone.\n\nIn May 2013 the Israeli and Polish archaeologists conducting excavations near Camp III, unearthed an escape tunnel  long and 1.6–2 m deep in some places, beginning under the barracks of the Jewish Sonderkommando and leading toward a double-row, barbed-wire fence. The tunnel may have collapsed with people inside; the camp perimeter is known to have been mined. Notably, the camp records do not mention any incident related to a tunnel escape.\n\nOther new findings included children's identification tags from the Netherlands, and seven human skeletal remains. These may be remains of the Jewish work-detail who were shot after completing removal of the genocide evidence.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Museum and Memorial in Sobibór – Official site (English)\n \"Sobibor.

She also has a two-foot deep stub keel in place of a swing keel, which adds 10\" to her minimum draft. That in combination with her 2,300 lb. weight (versus 2,150 for the Montego 19) makes her less easily trailered than the Montego 19 ... Best features: She is said to track well, no doubt mainly because of her long stub keel. The seven-foot cockpit is roomy and has high coamings for good back support. Ventilation includes four opening ports in addition to a forward hatch and companionway hatch—\ngreat for summer climates. Her average PHRF of 282 seems a bit high, particularly against other similarly shallow fixed-keelers with more top hamper (above-the-water superstructure) like the Buccaneer 200 .... Worst features: Her very shallow keel can sideslip, especially in heavy air, reducing speed and pointing ability. The hardware as shipped is minimal; missing are a vang, cunningham, and quick-release jibsheet cleats, along with a better system for cleating the mainsheet.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Reserved word\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is \"reserved from use\". This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no user-define meaning.\n\nA closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms \"reserved word\" and \"keyword\" are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is \"reserved for use as a keyword\" – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above.\n\nIn general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords – these are \"reserved for future use\". In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no reserved words, with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.\n\nDistinction\nThe sets of reserved words and keywords in a language often coincide or are almost equal, and the distinction is subtle, so the terms are often used interchangeably. However, in careful usage they are distinguished.\n\nMaking keywords be reserved words makes lexing easier, as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords – for example, in Java, goto is a reserved word, but has no meaning and does not appear in any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a reserved word may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.\n\nConversely, keywords need not be reserved words, with their role understood from context, or they may be distinguished in another manner, such as by stropping. For example, the phrase if = 1 is unambiguous in most grammars, since a control statement of an if clause cannot start with an =, and thus is allowed in some languages, such as FORTRAN. Alternatively, in ALGOL 68, keywords must be stropped – marked in some way to distinguished – in the strict language by listing in bold, and thus are not reserved words. Thus in the strict language the following expression is legal, as the bold keyword if does not conflict with the ordinary identifier if:\nif if eq 0 then 1 fi\nHowever, in ALGOL 68 there is also a stropping regime in which keywords are reserved words, an example of how these distinct concepts often coincide; this is followed in many modern languages.\n\nSyntax\n \nA reserved word is one that \"looks like\" a normal word, but is not allowed to be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it satisfies the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers – for example, being a sequence of letters – but cannot be used where identifiers are used. For example, the word if is commonly a reserved word, while x generally is not, so x = 1 is a valid assignment, but if = 1 is not.\n\nKeywords have varied uses, but primarily fall into a few classes: part of the phrase grammar (specifically a production rule with nonterminal symbols), with various meanings, often being used for control flow, such as the word if in most procedural languages, which indicates a conditional and takes clauses (the nonterminal symbols); names of primitive types in a language that support a type system, such as int; primitive literal values such as true for Boolean true; or sometimes special commands like exit. Other uses of keywords in phrases are for input/output, such as print.\n\nThe distinct definitions are clear when a language is analyzed by a combination of a lexer and a parser, and the syntax of the language is generated by a lexical grammar for the words, and a context-free grammar of production rules for the phrases. This is common in analyzing modern languages, and in this case keywords are a subset of reserved words, as they must be distinguished from identifiers at the word level (hence reserved words) to be syntactically analyzed differently at the phrase level (as keywords).\n\nIn this case reserved words are defined as part of the lexical grammar, and are each tokenized as a separate type, distinct from identifiers. In conventional notation, the reserved words if and then for example are tokenized as types IF and THEN, respectively, while x and y are both tokenized as type Identifier.\n\nKeywords, by contrast, syntactically appear in the phrase grammar, as terminal symbols. For example, the production rule for a conditional expression may be IF Expression THEN Expression. In this case IF and THEN are terminal symbols, meaning \"a token of type IF or THEN, respectively\" – and due to the lexical grammar, this means the string if or then in the original source. As an example of a primitive constant value, true may be a keyword representing the boolean value \"true\", in which case it should appear in the grammar as a possible expansion of the production BinaryExpression, for instance.\n\nReserved ranges\nBeyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.\n\nThis is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.\n\nThe frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation dunder; this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.\n\nSpecification\nThe list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.\n\nReasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like class or object. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.\n\nA notable example is in Java, where const and goto are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like const to the language, which was possible using the const word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) would break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.\n\nLanguages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:\n\nThat is, C11 introduced the keyword _Thread_local within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword thread_local despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.\n\nPredefined names\nA related notion to reserved words are predefined functions, methods, subroutines, or variables, particularly library routines from the standard library. These are similar in that they are part of the basic language, and may be used for similar purposes. However, these differ in that the name of a predefined function, method, or subroutine is typically categorized as an identifier instead of a reserved word, and is not treated specially in the syntactic analysis. Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.\n\nLanguages vary as to what is provided as a keyword and what is a predefined. Some languages, for instance, provide keywords for input/output operations whereas in others these are library routines. In Python (versions earlier than 3.0) and many BASIC dialects, print is a keyword. In contrast, the C, Lisp, and Python 3.0 equivalents printf, format, and print are functions in the standard library. Similarly, in Python prior to 3.0, None, True, and False were predefined variables, but not reserved words, but in Python 3.0 they were made into reserved words.\n\nDefinition\n\nSome use the terms \"keyword\" and \"reserved word\" interchangeably, while others distinguish usage, say by using \"keyword\" to mean a word that is special only in certain contexts but \"reserved word\" to mean a special word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. The meaning of keywords — and, indeed, the meaning of the notion of keyword — differs widely from language to language. Concretely, in ALGOL 68, keywords are stropped (in the strict language, written in bold) and are not reserved words – the unstropped word can be used as an ordinary identifier.\n\nThe \"Java Language Specification\" uses the term \"keyword\". The ISO 9899 standard for the C programming language uses the term \"keyword\".\n\nIn many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a keyword is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, then, and else are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions.\n\nIn some languages, such as ALGOL and Algol 68, keywords cannot be written verbatim, but must be stropped. This means that keywords must be marked somehow. E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not reserved words, and thus the same word can be used for as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strop the keywords, and instead have them simply be reserved words.\n\nSome languages, such as PostScript, are extremely liberal in this approach, allowing core keywords to be redefined for specific purposes.\n\nIn Common Lisp, the term \"keyword\" (or \"keyword symbol\") is used for a special sort of symbol, or identifier. Unlike other symbols, which usually stand for variables or functions, keywords are self-quoting and self-evaluating:98 and are interned in the KEYWORD package. Keywords are usually used to label named arguments to functions, and to represent symbolic values.  The symbols which name functions, variables, special forms and macros in the package named COMMON-LISP are basically reserved words. The effect of redefining them is undefined in ANSI Common Lisp. Binding them is possible. For instance the expression (if if case or) is possible, when if is a local variable. The leftmost if refers to the if operator; the remaining symbols are interpreted as variable names. Since there is a separate namespace for functions and variables, if could be a local variable. In Common Lisp, however, there are two special symbols which are not in the keyword package: the symbols t and nil.  When evaluated as expressions, they evaluate to themselves. They cannot be used as the names of functions or variables, so are de facto reserved. (let ((t 42))) is a well-formed expression, but the let operator will not permit the usage.\n\nTypically, when a programmer attempts to use a keyword for a variable or function name, a compilation error will be triggered. In most modern editors, the keywords are automatically set to have a particular text colour to remind or inform the programmers that they are keywords.\n\nIn languages with macros or lazy evaluation, control flow constructs such as if can be implemented as macros or functions. In languages without these expressive features, they are generally keywords.\n\nComparison by languages\n\nNot all languages have the same numbers of reserved words.  For example, Java (and other C derivatives) has a rather sparse complement of reserved words—approximately 50 – whereas COBOL has approximately 400.   At the other end of the spectrum, pure Prolog and PL/I have none at all.\n\nThe number of reserved words in a language has little to do with how “powerful” a language is.  COBOL was designed in the 1950s as a business language and was made to be self-documenting using English-like structural elements such as verbs, clauses, sentences, sections and divisions.  C, on the other hand, was written to be very terse (syntactically) and to get more text on the screen.  For example, compare the equivalent blocks of code from C and COBOL to calculate weekly earnings:\n\n      // Calculation in C:\n      \n      if (salaried)\n              amount = 40 * payrate;\n      else\n              amount = hours * payrate;\n      \n      *> Calculation in COBOL:\n      \n      IF Salaried THEN\n              MULTIPLY Payrate BY 40 GIVING Amount\n      ELSE\n              MULTIPLY Payrate BY Hours GIVING Amount\n      END-IF.\n      \n      *> Other example of calculation in COBOL:\n      \n      IF Salaried \n              COMPUTE Amount = Payrate * 40\n      ELSE\n              COMPUTE Amount = hours * payrate\n      END-IF.\n\nPure Prolog logic is expressed in terms of relations, and execution is triggered by running queries over these relations.  Constructs such as loops are implemented using recursive relationships.\n\nAll three of these languages can solve the same types of “problems” even though they have differing numbers of reserved words.  This “power” relates to their belonging to the set of Turing-complete languages.\n\nDisadvantages\nDefinition of reserved words in a language raises problems.  The language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a long list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers.  It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, \"overloading\" of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing.  Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.\n\nBecause reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, users may choose deliberate misspellings of reserved words as identifiers instead, such as  for Java variables of type .\n\nReserved words and language independence\n\nMicrosoft's .NET   Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product.  Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language.  For example, a Visual Basic.NET library may contain a class definition such as:\n\n' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:\n\nPublic Class this\n        ' This class does something...\nEnd Class\n\nIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type “this” would encounter a problem: 'this' is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:\n\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\nthis x = new this();  // Won't compile!\n\nA similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.\n\nThis is resolved by stropping. In order to work around this issue, the specification allows the programmer to (in C#) place the at-sign before the identifier which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:\n\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\n@this x = new @this();  // Will compile! \n\nFor consistency, this usage is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.\n\nSee also\n C reserved keywords\n List of Java keywords\n Symbol (programming)\n\nReferences\n\nProgramming constructs\nProgramming language topics", "machine_text": " Reserved word In many languages, including most programming languages, certain words are reserved and may not be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or other entities.

The discovery has also led to other models such as Tinbergen's Rule.\n\nAnalysis \nAccording to Meade's analysis, a country can find itself in the following four circumstances:\n\nThe problems in cases (a) and (b) can be solved using economic policies. Case (a) requires a expansionary fiscal and monetary policies that will reduce the surplus and spur recovery from the recession, while case (b) is the circumstance vice versa.\n\nHowever, in case (c), if the government and central bank of the country tries to restore payment equilibrium by expansionary policies, these measures will worsen inflation. The other alternative of tight fiscal and monetary policies means reduced inflation, but also worsen the surplus in payments. In the similar dilemma of case (d), the deficit implies that tight monetary and fiscal policies should be used, which worsens the country's recession, while the expansionary policies that will end the recession would worsen the payments deficit. Cases (c) and (d) are known as the Meade Conflict.\n\nInfluences \nThe phenomenon draws wide attention in China as the country was going through such circumstances in 2007 and 2018.

Lee, and the forces of the Union Army, under the command of General George Meade. After four bloody days of heavy fighting, the armies met in a major engagement on the roads and fields of a small Pennsylvania town, resulting in over 51,000 casualties. Following the defeat of Union forces at Chancellorsville, Virginia, in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Meade's Army of the Potomac followed Lee, seeking an opportunity to come to grips with the Confederate forces. Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brigadier General John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union cavalry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, and sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south. On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines. On the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle, the most costly in US history. On November 19, President Abraham Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the Gettysburg National Cemetery to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address. On March 3, 2014, the United States Congress, in recognition of the battle's significance, designated July 1–3, 2013, as \"Meade Conflict, 1863\" and as \"The 150th Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg\" in the state of Pennsylvania.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59343896}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maltese literature\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Maltese literature is any literature originating from Malta or by Maltese writers or literature written in the Maltese language.\n\nThis article will give an overview of the history of Maltese-language literature.\n\nHistory\n\nWritten Maltese \nAs Maltese evolved after Count Roger I of Sicily ended Arab rule on the island at the end of the 11th century, there was little interest in developing a written form of the language. Initially only the clergy, aristocracy and bourgeoisie were able to read and write and much of their communication was conducted in Latin. Throughout the centuries use of the Maltese language was often discouraged with varying enthusiasm, ostensibly in the hope that supplanting it would strengthen ties with the country which held possession of Malta at that particular point in time. Under the Knights of St John both Italian and French were used for official documents and correspondence. During the British colonial period the use of English was encouraged through education, with Italian regarded as the next most influential language. It was not until 1936 that Maltese was recognised as the island's official language. Uniquely, no other European country lacked a standardised written form of its language until the 19th century, when men such as Mikiel Anton Vassalli made a concerted effort to transcribe spoken Maltese into a written form, although examples of written Maltese exist from as early as the 15th century.\n\nDiglossia\nThe development of native Maltese literary works has historically been hampered by the diglossia that has characterized the culture of Malta throughout its history. For many centuries, Maltese was known as the language \"of the kitchen and the workshop\", while Italian was the language of education, literature, the arts, law and commerce.  Hence, until the early 20th century, the vast majority of literary works in Malta were written in Italian by the community of Maltese Italians. In early Maltese history, diglossia manifested itself in the co-existence of a developed form of Siculo-Arabic and the language of a series of rulers, most notably Latin, Greek, Sicilian, French, Spanish and Italian. From 1800 onwards these were largely supplanted by English. The Maltese language is today heavily overlaid with Romance and English influences as a result.\n\nAccording to Prof. Oliver Friggieri:\n\nMaltese writers developed an uninterrupted local \"Italian\" literary movement which went on up to about four decades ago, whereas Maltese as a literary idiom started to coexist on a wide scale in the last decades of the 19th century. Whilst Maltese has the historical priority on the level of the spoken language, Italian has the priority of being the almost exclusive written medium, for the socio-cultural affairs, for the longest period. The native tongue had only to wait for the arrival of a new mentality which could integrate an unwritten, popular tradition with a written, academically respectable one.\n\nThe emergence of Maltese literature\nThe oldest known literary text in the Maltese language is Pietru Caxaro's poem, Il-Kantilena (c. 1470 to 1485) (also known as Xidew il-Qada), followed by Gian Francesco Bonamico's sonnet of praise to Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner, Mejju gie' bl'Uard, u Zahar (The month of May has arrived, with roses and orange blossoms), c. 1672. The earliest known Maltese dictionary was written by Francois de Vion Thezan Court (c. 1640). In 1700, an anonymous Gozitan poet wrote Jaħasra Mingħajr Ħtija (Unfortunately Innocent). A Maltese translation of the Lord's Prayer appeared in Johannes Heinrich Maius's work Specimen Lingua Punicæ in hodierna Melitensium superstitis (1718), demonstrating the formerly wide-held belief that the language had a Punic heritage. A collection of religious sermons by a certain Dun Ignazio Saverio Mifsud, published between 1739 and 1746, is regarded as the earliest known example of Maltese prose.\n\nAn anonymous poem entitled Fuqek Nitħaddet Malta (I am talking about you, Malta), was written c. 1749, regarding the Conspiracy of the Slaves. A few years later, in 1752, a catechism entitled Tagħlim Nisrani ta' Dun Franġisk Wizzino (Don Francesco Wizzino's Christian Teachings) was published in both Maltese and Italian. The occasion of Carnival in 1760 saw the publication of a collection of burlesque verses under the heading Żwieġ la Maltija (Marriage, in the Maltese Style), by Dun Feliċ Demarco.\n\nA child of the Romantic movement, Maltese patriot Mikiel Anton Vassalli (1764–1829) hailed the emergence of literary Maltese as \"one of the ancient patrimonies...of the new emerging nation\" and saw this nascent trend as: (1) the affirmation of the singular and collective identity, and (2) the cultivation and diffusion of the national speech medium as the most sacred component in the definition of the patria and as the most effective justification both for a dominated community's claim to be a nation and for the subsequent struggle against foreign rulers.\n\nBetween 1798 and 1800, while Malta was under French occupation, a Maltese translation of L-Għanja tat-Trijonf tal-Libertà (Ode to the Triumph of Liberty), by Citizen La Coretterie, Secretary to the French Government Commissioner, was published on the occasion of Bastille Day.\n\nThe first translation into Maltese of a biblical text, the Gospel of St. John, was published in 1822 (trans. Ġużeppi Marija Cannolo), on the initiative of the Bible Society in Malta. The first Maltese language newspaper, l-Arlekkin Jew Kawlata Ingliża u Maltija (The Harlequin, or a mix of English and Maltese) appeared in 1839, and featured the poems l-Imħabba u Fantasija (Love and Fantasy) and Sunett (A Sonnett).\n\nThe first epic poem in Maltese, Il-Ġifen Tork (The Turkish Caravel), by Giovanni Antonio Vassallo, was published in 1842, followed by Ħrejjef bil-Malti (Legends in Maltese) and Ħrejjef u Ċajt bil-Malti (Legends and Jokes in Maltese) in 1861 and 1863 respectively. The same author published the first history book in the Maltese language entitled Storja ta’ Malta Miktuba għall-Poplu (The People's History of Malta) in 1862.\n\n1863 saw the publication of the first novel in Maltese, Elvira Jew Imħabba ta’ Tirann (Elvira, or the Love of a Tyrant) by the Neapolitan author, Giuseppe Folliero de Luna. Anton Manwel Caruana's novel Ineż Farruġ (1889), the first Maltese novel, was modelled on traditional Italian historical novels, such as Manzoni's I promessi sposi and has been the subject of recent scholarly attention.\n\nNotable Maltese writers \n Clare Azzopardi\n Antoine Cassar\n John A.

It wasn't rediscovered until 1966 or 1968 by Prof. Godfrey Wettinger and Fr. Mikiel Fsadni in the Valletta Notarial Archives. Frans Sammut published a revolutionary interpretation of it in 2009. Karmenu Mallia translated it into Esperanto and wrote an article about it in 'Literatura Foiro'.\n\nContemporary literature \n\nThe post-War years saw the emergence of Moviment Qawmien Letterarju (Literary Revival Movement) in 1967, an avant-garde literary movement the protagonists of which included Oliver Friggieri (later Professor of Maltese at the University of Malta), Frans Sammut (1945–2011), the \"national author\", Alfred Sant (who was Prime Minister from 1996 to 1998), Lino Spiteri (who was Finance Minister in two Governments), and others.\n\nAmong Oliver Friggieri's most important works is the collection of his poems.\n\nFrans Sammut's reputation is built on his novels Il-Gaġġa (on which the film with the same name is based), Samuraj, Paceville and Il-Ħolma Maltija (translated in Esperanto as La Malta Revo).\nAlfred Sant is known for his theatre collected mostly in his Fid-Dell tal-Katidral u Drammi Ohra, whereas Lino Spiteri became renowned for his novel Rivoluzzjoni Do Minore and his short stories.\n\nThe Moviment Qawmien Letterarju scene eventually gave way to a new wave of writers, whose voices have shaped the contemporary literature scene. Foremost amongst these are writers such as Albert Marshall, Immanuel Mifsud, Adrian Grima, and Antoine Cassar. The contemporary scene has also seen the emergence of a new generation of female writers including Simone Inguanez, Nadia Mifsud, Simone Galea, Elizabeth Grech and Clare Azzopardi.\n\nNowadays Maltese literature is dominated by literature in the Maltese language (e.g., Alex Vella Gera, Guze' Stagno), some works in English (Francis Ebejer for instance), and some works in Italian, such as the poems of Judge J.J. Cremona and Albert Caruana's ebook Il Sindaco di Racalmusci.\n\nList of books in Maltese \nTaħt Tliet Saltniet\nŻmien L-Ispanjoli\nIl-Gaġġa\nSamuraj\nIl-Ħolma Maltija\nPaceville\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nMain Trends in the history of Maltese literature\nMaltese poetry\nPost-Independence Maltese poetry\nMaltese Literature - the New Writing\nContemporary Writing Scene in Malta\nMaltese Literature Since 1990\nLetteratura Maltija\nMaħżen Poeżija\nRadio Interviews", "machine_text": " Maltese literature Maltese literature is the literature of the Maltese people, which is in the process of becoming a separate ethnic and national group, the Maltese. The first work of Maltese literature is the ll-Ilibre tar-Rummo, a 16th-century pastoral romance by Antonio de Vezzosi. The national epic of Malta is The Great Siege (1565), byRemix Censu. In 1607, the Carmelite priest and professor of philosophy Peter Caxaro wrote what is considered to be the first major work of Maltese literature, his Latini Ebraici: Luqmani, a translation of the Septuagint into Maltese. Caxaro's work was followed by a number of other Jewish-Maltese translations of the Old Testament, including that of 1636 by Mordecai Farrugia. These works are important because they helped to develop a standardized language among the Jewish and Christian Maltese communities. The first known Maltese dictionary was also written by a Jewish author, Samuel Benjamin Ben Hamo, in the early 18th century. Ben Hamo's work contains many examples of early Maltese poetry, which like most Maltese poetry written before the 20th century is in the form of the sonnet or other traditional verse forms. The most significant poet of this period was Pietru Caxaro (1634–1716), who is best known for his long poem L-Iblein. In the early 19th century, a number of poets began to move away from the traditional forms and to write in a more modern style. The best known of these was Dun Karm, who is credited as the first to have broken with tradition and to have written verse in the modern Maltese language. In the 20th century, the poets started to introduce new themes, such as social and political commentary, the importance of the Maltese language, and the relationship between Malta and England. The most important poets of this period were Ġużè Muscat, Robert Samut, and Joe Friggieri. In the 21st century, Maltese literature has been strongly influenced by the work of two poets, Adrian Grima and Antoine Cassar. Grima's work is characterized by a return to traditional verse forms, as well as by its engagement with social and political issues. Cassar's work is notable for its exploration of the relationship between Malta and its history, and for its use of experimental forms.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11974834}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Panmixia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Panmixia (or panmixis) means random mating. A panmictic population is one where all individuals are potential partners. This assumes that there are no mating restrictions, neither genetic nor behavioural, upon the population and that therefore all recombination is possible. The Wahlund effect assumes that the overall population is panmictic.\n\nIn genetics, random mating involves the mating of individuals regardless of any physical, genetic or social preference. In other words, the mating between two organisms is not influenced by any environmental, hereditary or social interaction. Hence, potential mates have an equal chance of being selected. Random mating is a factor assumed in the Hardy–Weinberg principle and is distinct from lack of natural selection: in viability selection for instance, selection occurs before mating.\n\nDescription\nIn simple terms, panmixia (or panmicticism) is the ability of individuals in a population to interbreed without restrictions; individuals are able to move about freely within their habitat, possibly over a range of hundreds to thousands of miles, and thus breed with other members of the population.\n\nTo signify the importance of this, imagine several different finite populations of the same species (for example: a grazing herbivore), isolated from each other by some physical characteristic of the environment (dense forest areas separating grazing lands). As time progresses, natural selection and genetic drift will slowly move each population toward genetic differentiation that would make each population genetically unique (that could eventually lead to speciation events or extirpation).\n\nHowever, if the separating factor is removed before this happens (e.g. a road is cut through the forest), and the individuals are allowed to move about freely, the individual populations will still be able to interbreed. As the species's populations interbreed over time, they become more genetically uniform, functioning again as a single panmictic population.\n\nIn attempting to describe the mathematical properties of structured populations, Sewall Wright proposed a \"factor of Panmixia\" (P) to include in the equations describing the gene frequencies in a population, and accounting for a population's tendency towards panmixia, while a \"factor of Fixation\" (F) would account for a population's departure from the Hardy–Weinberg expectation, due to less than panmictic mating. In this formulation, the two quantities are complementary, i.e. P = 1 − F. From this factor of fixation, he later developed the F statistics.\n\nBackground information \nIn a panmictic species, all of the individuals of a single species are potential partners, and the species gives no mating restrictions throughout the population. Panmixia can also be referred to as random mating, referring to a population that randomly chooses their mate, rather than sorting between the adults of the population.\n\nPanmixia allows for species to reach genetic diversity through gene flow more efficiently than monandry species. However, outside population factors, like drought and limited food sources, can affect the way any species will mate. When scientists examine species mating to understand their mating style, they look at factors like genetic markers, genetic differentiation, and gene pool.\n\nPanmictic species \n\nA panmictic population of Monostroma latissimum, a marine green algae, shows sympatric speciation in southwest Japanese islands. Although panmictic, the population is diversifying. Dawson's Burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni, may be forced to aggregate in common mating areas due to uneven resource distribution in its harsh desert environment. Pantala flavescens should be considered as a global panmictic population.\n\nRelated experiments and species \n\n Anguilla rostrate, or the American eel, exhibits panmixia throughout the entire species. This allows the eel to have phenotypic variation in their offspring and survive in a wide range of environmental conditions\n In 2016, BMC Evolutionary Biology conducted a study on Pachygrapsus marmoratus, the marbled crab, marking them as panmictic species. The study claimed that the crabs' mating behavior is characterized by genetic differentiation due to geographic breaks across its distribution range and not panmixia\n In a heterogeneous environment such as the forests of Oregon, United States, Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii) exhibit local patterns of adaptation. In a study conducted by Chaves (2014) a population along an entire transect was found to be panmictic. Traits observed in this study included skull shape, fur color, etc. \n Swordfish based in the Indian Ocean (Xiphias gladius) have been found to be a single panmictic population. Markers used in the study carried out by Muths et al (2013) found large spatial and temporal homogeneity in genetic structure satisfactory in order to consider the swordfish a singular panmictic population.\n\nSee also \n Assortative mating (one form of non-random mating)\n Population genetics\nMonogamy: A mating system in which one male mates with just one female, and one female mates with just one male, in breeding season \nPolygyny: A mating system in which a male fertilizes the eggs of several partners in breeding season\nSexual selection: A form of natural selection that occurs when individuals vary in their ability to compete with others for mates or to attract members of the opposite sex\nFitness: A measure of the genes contributed to the next generation by an individual, often stated in terms of the number of surviving offspring produced by the individual\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n\nPopulation\nPopulation genetics", "machine_text": " Panmixia is the mixing of different genetic material in a population through breeding. In a panmictic population, there is no genetic structure; every individual has the same probability of mating with every other individual. A population that has lost genetic structure is sometimes said to be panmictic. Panmixia is a demographic process that increases genetic diversity. A population that is panmictic will, on average, have a higher genetic diversity than a population that is not panmictic. Panmixia will also cause a decrease in genetic drift, because there will be no longer be any tendency for the genes to remain at their current frequency. A population can be made up of multiple panmictic populations that breed with each other. These populations are called demes. A group of demes that live in the same area and can potentially interbreed is called a metacommunity. A metacommunity can be made up of different species, or the same species with different types of individuals (such as a population of the same species with some individuals that are male and some that are female). In genetics, panmixia is the opposite of the Hardy–Weinberg principle, which describes the behavior of a large population from one generation to the next in the absence of disturbing factors and with the assumption of random mating; the principle is based on the fact that genetic variation will stay constant from one generation to the next in a large population from the moment there is no change in the genetic constitution of the population and with the assumption of random mating. The Hardy–Weinberg principle is used to describe the evolution of a large population, while panmixia is used to describe the evolution of a small population. The genetic variation of a small population can change rapidly, and the genetic constitution of the population can change immediately. The population size can also influence the rate of panmixia. As the population size increases, the rate of panmixia decreases. The term panmixia is from the Greek παν (pan), meaning \"all\", and μετíξη (meMIXIS), meaning \"mixing\". Panmixia is important for the development of a species, because it can increase the genetic diversity of a population. Genetic diversity is important because it can increase the adaptability of a species. A population with high genetic diversity will be better able to adapt to environmental changes than a population with low genetic diversity. Panmixia is also important for the conservation of a species. A population with high genetic diversity will be more adaptable to environmental changes, and will be better able to avoid inbreeding. Inbreeding can cause a population to become genetically damaged, and can cause the population to go extinct.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9782179}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bracket creep\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bracket creep is usually defined as the process by which inflation pushes wages and salaries into higher tax brackets, leading to fiscal drag. However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase.\n\nMost progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.\n\nExamples\nSuppose a person earns $20,000 per year and is liable to 20% tax on earnings above a threshold of $5,000 per year. Then they pay ($20,000–$5,000)*0.2 = $3,000 in taxes, or 15% of their income. Now suppose that due to inflation, their wage goes up by 5%, but the government does not increase the tax threshold. They must now pay ($21,000–$5,000)*0.2 = $3,200 or 15.2% of their income as tax. Thus the proportion of the person's income that is paid as tax has increased. The average tax rate went up even though the tax payer remained in the 20% tax bracket. That is, the marginal tax rate did not change. Since the wage increase was due to inflation, the person's net real income declined.\n\nIn the United States, the Alternative Minimum Tax originally (1971) targeted 155 high-income households; based on 2004 law, it would affect 20% of households by 2010.\n\nPolitical dimension\nNominal bracket creep can easily be countered by a system of index-linked tax brackets, but this may be politically undesirable. Many voters do not perceive the effects of bracket creep, and so the government may prefer to adjust tax brackets manually once every few years: in effect, restoring the real tax rates to their approximate pre-inflation levels but in a way that gives the government the appearance that they are cutting taxes. Not surprisingly, such changes are usually made right before a general election is to be held.\n\nReferences\n\nIncome taxes\nInflation", "machine_text": " Bracket creep Bracket creep is a term used in Australian politics to describe a situation in which the income tax brackets are not indexed to inflation, and therefore the percentage of tax payable within each bracket increases over time for a given income. This is a result of the way in which income tax scales are typically expressed, as income ranges (or \"brackets\") with associated tax rates. The term was coined by a former senior economic adviser to a Liberal Party leader, John Quiggin, during a period of criticism of the Australian Labor Party's (ALP) economic management. Quiggin was concerned that the real value of the tax-free threshold was declining and that the highest marginal tax rate was applying to a wider range of incomes. He argued that this was a consequence of decisions by the ALP to freeze tax brackets during the 1990s and to introduce a more progressive tax scale with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2000. The term has more recently been used by other analysts to describe the effects of bracket creep on the overall level of income tax revenue collected by governments. In the Australian context, bracket creep occurs when a person's income increases over time, but the thresholds (or \"brackets\") within the income tax scale do not increase in line with inflation. This means that a person can be pushed into a higher marginal tax bracket, and effectively pay a higher rate of tax, even though their income has not increased in real terms. The effect is similar to the way in which inflation can reduce the value of money over time. For example, if a person's income is $80,000 and they are subject to the 37% marginal tax rate, they would pay $29,000 in income tax. If the threshold for the 37% marginal tax rate is not indexed to inflation, and instead stays fixed at $80,000, the person would eventually be pushed into the higher marginal tax rate of 45% when their income reaches $120,000. At this new marginal tax rate, they would pay $33,000 in income tax, despite the fact that their income has only increased by $40,000 in absolute terms. The effect of bracket creep can be illustrated by considering the effective tax rate, which is the average tax rate paid by a taxpayer over a period of time. The effective tax rate can be significantly higher than the marginal tax rate, which is the tax rate paid on each additional dollar of income. For example, if a taxpayer has an income of $100,000 and is subject to the 37% marginal tax rate, their effective tax rate would be higher than 37% because they would be paying tax on a larger portion of their income. If the thresholds for the marginal tax rate are not indexed to inflation, the effective tax rate will increase over time as the taxpayer's income grows. Bracket creep can also be a significant factor in increasing the overall level of income tax revenue collected by governments. If the thresholds for the marginal tax rates are not indexed to inflation, the effective tax rate will increase over time, resulting in more revenue being collected from each taxpayer. This can be a significant source of revenue for governments, and can contribute to rising budget deficits.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 709199}

The book incorporates numerous sources, including newspaper articles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, to provide context and insight into attitudes at the time. It also draws parallels to the racial challenges experienced and spotlighted in the 21st century to emphasise the importance of Poitier’s journey in inspiring black Americans to stand up for their rights. \n\nThe book commences by outlining Poitier’s early life and his beginnings in the film industry, linking the roles he portrayed to his childhood and the lessons instilled in him by his father. Following Poitier’s “progress as an actor [which] was painfully slow for many years”, a picture emerges of a hard-working Poitier who joined the army, opened a restaurant, worked long hours in the kitchen and considered brick laying and cab driving to make ends meet and later, support his family. Despite the struggle for roles, Poitier was, for the most part, selective in the characters he would portray as he tried to balance “making a living as an actor, becoming as popular as a white actor and staying true to a representation of people with dark skin who can do anything a white man can do”.\n\nPowers discusses the barriers faced by Poitier including the lack of representation of black people within films and the subsequent lack of roles, the pressure to sign a loyalty oath in exchange for work, and the political climate in which Poitier’s films were released. The book goes on to explore Poitier’s associations with Stanley Kramer, Spencer Tracy, Martin Luther King and Harry Belafonte and the way in which each of these influenced and shaped his career. The details of these relationships describe the stepping-stones to Poitier’s directorial debut, Buck and the Preacher. Concluding with an analysis of Buck and the Preacher, Powers provides insight into the critical reception of the film and illustrates how the film, often perceived as a flop, marked the beginning of Poitier’s success as a director.\n\nQuotes\n\nReferences \n\nBiography (genre)\nHollywood\nAfrican-American actors\nRacism", "machine_text": " Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon The first African-American film star to win a Best Actor Oscar, Sidney Poitier (1927–2022) played a pivotal role in the emergence of Black icons in Hollywood films. He made his film debut in the 1950 film No Way Out, and his breakthrough came with his first leading role in the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle. His work as a civil rights activist and as a Bahamian citizen also played a role in the early 1960s movement for the independence of the Bahamian colony from the British Empire. In the early 1960s, Poitier's work as a film, stage, and television actor began to receive awards and critical acclaim, and he became the first African-American male to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his work in the 1964 film Lilies of the Field. His other major roles during this period included A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Pressure Point (1962), and In the Heat of the Night (1967).

Francis is the first pope to be a member of the Society of Jesus, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first pope from outside Europe since Gregory III, a Syrian who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Bergoglio worked for a time as a bouncer and a janitor as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a food science laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes.\n\nFrancis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding abortion, clerical celibacy, and the ordination of women, but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics, consumerism, and overdevelopment, and advocates taking action on climate change, a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si'. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba and supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises. Since 2018, he has been an opponent of populism. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, including his promotion of ecumenism, as well as admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to communion with the publication of Amoris laetitia.\n\nEarly years \n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in Flores, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He was the eldest of five children of Mario José Bergoglio (1908–1959) and Regina María Sívori (1911–1981). Mario Bergoglio was an Italian immigrant accountant born in Portacomaro (Province of Asti) in Italy's Piedmont region. Regina Sívori was a housewife born in Buenos Aires to a family of northern Italian (Piedmontese-Genoese) origin. Mario José's family left Italy in 1929 to escape the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini. According to María Elena Bergoglio (b. 1948), the pope's only living sibling, they did not emigrate for economic reasons. His other siblings were Alberto Horacio (1942–2010), Oscar Adrián (1938–deceased) and Marta Regina (1940–2007). Two great-nephews, Antonio and Joseph, died in a traffic collision. His niece, Cristina Bergoglio, is a painter based in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIn the sixth grade, Bergoglio attended Wilfrid Barón de los Santos Ángeles, a school of the Salesians of Don Bosco, in Ramos Mejía, Buenos Aires Province. He attended the technical secondary school Escuela Técnica Industrial N° 27 Hipólito Yrigoyen, named after a past Argentine president, and graduated with a chemical technician's diploma (not a master's degree in chemistry, as some media outlets incorrectly reported). In that capacity, he spent several years working in the food section of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory, where he worked under Esther Ballestrino. Prior to working as a chemical technician, Bergoglio had also worked as a bar bouncer and as a janitor sweeping floors.\n\nWhen he was 21 years old, he suffered from life-threatening pneumonia and three cysts. He had part of a lung excised shortly afterwards. Bergoglio has been a lifelong supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro football club. Bergoglio is also a fan of the films of Tita Merello, neorealism, and tango dancing, with a fondness for the traditional music of Argentina and Uruguay known as the milonga.\n\nJesuit (1958–2013) \nBergoglio found his vocation to the priesthood while he was on his way to celebrate the Spring Day. He passed by a church to go to confession, and was inspired by the priest. Bergoglio studied at the archdiocesan seminary, Inmaculada Concepción Seminary, in Villa Devoto, Buenos Aires, and, after three years, entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on 11 March 1958. Bergoglio has said that, as a young seminarian, he had a crush on a girl he met and briefly doubted about continuing the religious career. As a Jesuit novice he studied humanities in Santiago, Chile. After his novitiate in the Society of Jesus, Bergoglio officially became a Jesuit on 12 March 1960, when he made the religious profession of the initial, perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience of a member of the order.\n\nIn 1960, Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio Máximo de San José in San Miguel, Buenos Aires Province. He taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, a high school in Santa Fe, from 1964 to 1965. In 1966, he taught the same courses at the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires.\n\nPresbyterate (1969–1992) \nIn 1967 Bergoglio began his theological studies at Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel and on 13 December 1969 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano. He served as the master of novices for the province there and became a professor of theology.\n\nBergoglio completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, tertianship, at Alcalá de Henares, Spain, and took final, solemn vows as a Jesuit, including the fourth vow of obedience to missioning by the pope, on 22 April 1973. He was named provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina that July, for a six-year term which ended in 1979. In 1973, shortly after being named provincial superior, he had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. After the completion of his term of office, in 1980 he was named the rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel where he had studied. Before taking up this new appointment, he spent the first three months of 1980 in Ireland to learn English, staying at the Jesuit Centre at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin. He served at San Miguel for six years until 1986 when, at the discretion of Jesuit superior-general Peter Hans Kolvenbach, he was replaced by someone more in tune with the worldwide trend in the Society of Jesus toward emphasizing social justice, rather than his emphasis on popular religiosity and direct pastoral work.\n\nHe spent several months at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany, considering possible dissertation topics. He settled on exploring the work of the German / Italian theologian Romano Guardini, particularly his study of 'Contrast' published in his 1925 work Der Gegensatz. However, he was to return to Argentina prematurely to serve as a confessor and spiritual director to the Jesuit community in Córdoba. In Germany, he saw the painting Mary, Untier of Knots in Augsburg and brought a copy of the painting to Argentina where it has become an important Marian devotion. As a student at the Salesian school, Bergoglio was mentored by Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest Stefan Czmil. Bergoglio often rose hours before his classmates to serve Mass for Czmil.\n\nBergoglio was asked in 1992 by Jesuit authorities not to reside in Jesuit houses, because of continued tensions with Jesuit leaders and scholars, a sense of Bergoglio's \"dissent,\" views of his Catholic orthodoxy and his opposition to theology of liberation, and his work as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. As a bishop he was no longer subject to his Jesuit superior. From then on, he did not visit Jesuit houses and was in \"virtual estrangement from the Jesuits\" until after his election as pope.\n\nPre-papal episcopate (1992–2013) \nBergoglio was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and consecrated on 27 June 1992 as titular bishop of Auca, with Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving as principal consecrator. He chose as his episcopal motto Miserando atque eligendo. It is drawn from Saint Bede's homily on Matthew 9:9–13: \"because he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him\".\n\nOn 3 June 1997, Bergoglio was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires with right of succession. Upon Quarracino's death on 28 February 1998, Bergoglio became metropolitan archbishop of Buenos Aires. In that role, Bergoglio created new parishes and restructured the archdiocese administrative offices, led pro-life initiatives, and created a commission on divorces. One of Bergoglio's major initiatives as archbishop was to increase the Church's presence in the slums of Buenos Aires. Under his leadership, the number of priests assigned to work in the slums doubled. This work led to him being called the \"Slum Bishop\".\n\nEarly in his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks. The shares in banks had led the local church to a propensity towards high spending, and the archdiocese was nearing bankruptcy as a result. As a normal customer of the bank, the church was forced into a higher fiscal discipline.\n\nOn 6 November 1998, while remaining archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was named ordinary for those Eastern Catholics in Argentina who lacked a prelate of their own church. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said that Bergoglio understands the liturgy, rites, and spirituality of Shevchuk's Greek Catholic Church and always \"took care of our Church in Argentina\" as ordinary for Eastern Catholics during his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2000, Bergoglio was the only church official to reconcile with Jerónimo Podestá, a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the Argentine Revolution military dictatorship in 1972. He defended Podestá's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage. That same year, Bergoglio said the Argentine Catholic Church needed \"to put on garments of public penance for the sins committed during the years of the dictatorship\" in the 1970s, during the Dirty War.\n\nBergoglio made it his custom to celebrate the Holy Thursday ritual washing of feet in places such as jails, hospitals, retirement homes or slums. In 2007, just two days after Benedict XVI issued new rules for using the liturgical forms that preceded the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Bergoglio established a fixed place for a weekly Mass in this extraordinary form of the Roman Rite. It was celebrated weekly.\n\nOn 8 November 2005, Bergoglio was elected president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005–08). He was reelected to another three-year term on 11 November 2008. He remained a member of that commission's permanent governing body, president of its committee for the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and a member of its liturgy committee for the care of shrines. While head of the Argentine Catholic bishops' conference, Bergoglio issued a collective apology for his church's failure to protect people from the Junta during the Dirty War. When he turned 75 in December 2011, Bergoglio submitted his resignation as archbishop of Buenos Aires to Pope Benedict XVI as required by canon law. Still, as he had no coadjutor archbishop, he stayed in office, waiting for an eventual replacement appointed by the Vatican.\n\nCardinalate (2001–2013) \n\nAt the consistory of 21 February 2001, Archbishop Bergoglio was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II with the title of cardinal priest of San Roberto Bellarmino, a church served by Jesuits and named for one; he was formally installed in that church the following 14 October. When he traveled to Rome for the ceremony, he and his sister María Elena visited the village in northern Italy where their father was born. As cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to five administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He was a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Commission for Latin America. Later that year, when Cardinal Edward Egan returned to New York following the September 11 attacks, Bergoglio replaced him as relator (recording secretary) in the Synod of Bishops, and, according to the Catholic Herald, created \"a favourable impression as a man open to communion and dialogue\".\n\nCardinal Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism, and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle contributed to his reputation for humility. He lived in a small apartment, rather than in the elegant bishop's residence in the suburb of Olivos. He took public transportation and cooked his own meals. He limited his time in Rome to \"lightning visits\". He was known to be devoted to St. Thérèse of Lisieux, and he enclosed a small picture of her in the letters he wrote, calling her \"a great missionary saint\".\n\nAfter Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, Bergoglio attended his funeral and was considered one of the papabile for succession to the papacy. He participated as a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. In the National Catholic Reporter, John L. Allen Jr. reported that Bergoglio was a frontrunner in the 2005 conclave. In September 2005, the Italian magazine Limes published claims that Bergoglio had been the runner-up and main challenger to Cardinal Ratzinger at that conclave and that he had received 40 votes in the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot. The claims were based on a diary purportedly belonging to an anonymous cardinal who had been present at the conclave. According to the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, this number of votes had no precedent for a Latin American papabile. La Stampa reported that Bergoglio was in close contention with Ratzinger during the election, until he made an emotional plea that the cardinals should not vote for him. According to Tornielli, Bergoglio made this request to prevent the conclave from delaying too much in the election of a pope.\n\nAs a cardinal, Bergoglio was associated with Communion and Liberation, a Catholic evangelical lay movement of the type known as associations of the faithful. He sometimes made appearances at the annual gathering known as the Rimini Meeting held during the late summer months in Italy. In 2005, Cardinal Bergoglio authorized the request for beatification—the third step towards sainthood—for six members of the Pallottine community murdered in the San Patricio Church massacre. At the same time, Bergoglio ordered an investigation into the murders themselves, which had been widely blamed on the National Reorganization Process, the military junta that ruled Argentina at the time.\n\nRelations with Argentine governments\n\nDirty War \n\nBergoglio was the subject of allegations regarding the Navy's kidnapping of two Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Franz Jalics, in May 1976, during Argentina's Dirty War. He feared for the priests' safety and had tried to change their work prior to their arrest; however, contrary to reports, he never tried to throw them out of the Jesuit order. In 2005, Myriam Bregman, a human rights lawyer, filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the kidnapping. Her complaint did not specify how Bergoglio was involved; Bergoglio's spokesman flatly denied the allegations. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. The priests were tortured, but were found alive five months later, drugged and semi-naked. Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the authorities that he endorsed their work. Yorio, who died in 2000, said in a 1999 interview that he believed that Bergoglio did nothing \"to free us, in fact just the opposite\". Jalics initially refused to discuss the complaint after moving into seclusion in a German monastery. However, two days after the election of Francis, Jalics issued a statement confirming the kidnapping and attributing the cause to a former lay colleague who became a guerrilla, was captured, then named Yorio and Jalics when interrogated. The following week, Jalics issued a second, clarifying statement: \"It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio (…) the fact is, Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio.\"\n\nBergoglio told his authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, that after the priests' imprisonment, he worked behind the scenes for their release; Bergoglio's intercession with dictator Jorge Rafael Videla on their behalf may have saved their lives. Bergoglio also told Rubin that he had often sheltered people from the dictatorship on church property, and once gave his own identity papers to a man who looked like him, so he could flee Argentina. The interview with Rubin, reflected in the biography El jesuita, is the only time Bergoglio has spoken to the press about those events. Alicia Oliveira, a former Argentine judge, has also reported that Bergoglio helped people flee Argentina during the rule of the junta. Since Francis became pope, Gonzalo Mosca and José Caravias have related to journalists accounts of how Bergoglio helped them flee the Argentine dictatorship.\n\nOliveira described the future pope as \"anguished\" and \"very critical of the dictatorship\" during the Dirty War. Oliveira met with him at the time and urged Bergoglio to speak out—he told her that \"he couldn't. That it wasn't an easy thing to do.\" Artist and human rights activist Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said: \"Perhaps he didn't have the courage of other priests, but he never collaborated with the dictatorship. …Bergoglio was no accomplice of the dictatorship.\" Graciela Fernández Meijide, member of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, also said that there was no proof linking Bergoglio with the dictatorship. She told the Clarín newspaper: \"There is no information and Justice couldn't prove it. I was in the APDH during all the dictatorship years and I received hundreds of testimonies. Bergoglio was never mentioned. It was the same in the CONADEP. Nobody mentioned him as instigator or as anything.\" Ricardo Lorenzetti, President of the Argentine Supreme Court, also has said that Bergoglio is \"completely innocent\" of the accusations. Historian Uki Goñi pointed that, during early 1976, the military junta still had a good image among society, and that the scale of the political repression was not known until much later; Bergoglio would have had little reason to suspect that the detention of Yorio and Jalics could end up in their deaths.\n\nWhen Bergoglio became pope, an alleged photo of him giving the sacramental bread to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became popular in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper Página/12. The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Berón de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church \"Pequeña Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione\" in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the Crónica newspaper.\n\nFernando de la Rúa \nFernando de la Rúa replaced Carlos Menem as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral on the First National Government holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society. Argentina faced an economic depression at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la Rúa asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was canceled because of a misunderstanding by De la Rúa's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop Jorge Casaretto considers it unlikely, as De la Rúa only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.\n\nThe Justicialist Party won the 2001 elections and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed Ramón Puerta as president of the Senate. As vice president Carlos Álvarez resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the order of precedence. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la Rúa, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.\n\nDuring police repression of the riots of December 2001, he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters and vandals from peaceful protesters.\n\nNéstor and Cristina Kirchner \n\nWhen Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the cathedral for the 2004 First National Government holiday, President Néstor Kirchner attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements. Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the cathedral was suspended. In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit Joaquín Piña to win the elections in the Misiones Province and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution. Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010. Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during disturbances in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators. The campaign to enact same-sex marriage legislation was a particularly tense period in their relations.\n\nWhen Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper Página/12 published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the National Library described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a \"Copernican shift\" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon. On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner. They exchanged gifts and lunched together. This was the new pope's first meeting with a head of state, and there was speculation that the two were mending their relations. Página/12 removed their controversial articles about Bergoglio, written by Horacio Verbitsky, from their web page, as a result of this change.\n\nPapacy (2013–present) \n\nElected at 76 years old, Francis was reported to be healthy and his doctors have said his missing lung tissue, removed in his youth, does not significantly affect his health. The only concern would be decreased respiratory reserve if he had a respiratory infection. In the past, one attack of sciatica in 2007 prevented him from attending a consistory and delayed his return to Argentina for several days. Francis is the first Jesuit pope. This was a significant appointment, because of the sometimes tense relations between the Society of Jesus and the Holy See. However, Bergoglio came in second to Cardinal Ratzinger on all the ballots in the 2005 conclave, and at the time appeared as the only other viable candidate.\nHe is also the first from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Many media reported him as being the first non-European pope, but he is actually the 11th; the previous was Gregory III from Syria, who died in 741. Moreover, although Francis was not born in Europe, he is ethnically European; his father and both of his mother's parents are from northern Italy.\n\nAs pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as \"no frills\", noting that it is \"his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration.\" On the night of his election, he took a bus back to his hotel with the cardinals, rather than be driven in the papal car. The next day, he visited Cardinal Jorge María Mejía in the hospital and chatted with patients and staff. At his first media audience, the Saturday after his election, the pope explained his papal name choice, citing Saint Francis of Assisi as \"the man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man\", and he added \"[h]ow I would like a poor Church, and for the poor\".\n\nIn addition to his native Spanish, he speaks fluent Italian (the official language of Vatican City and the \"everyday language\" of the Holy See) and German. He is also conversant in Latin (the official language of the Holy See), French, Portuguese, and English, and he understands the Piedmontese language and some Genoese.\n\nFrancis chose not to live in the official papal residence in the Apostolic Palace, but to remain in the Vatican guest house, in a suite in which he can receive visitors and hold meetings. He is the first pope since Pope Pius X to live outside the papal apartments. Francis still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus.\n\nElection \n\nBergoglio was elected pope on 13 March 2013, the second day of the 2013 papal conclave, taking the papal name Francis. Francis was elected on the fifth ballot of the conclave. The Habemus papam announcement was delivered by the cardinal protodeacon, Jean-Louis Tauran. Cardinal Christoph Schönborn later said that Bergoglio was elected following two supernatural signs, one in the conclave and hence confidential, and a Latin-American couple of friends of Schönborn who whispered Bergoglio's name in Schönborn's ear; Schönborn commented \"if these people say Bergoglio, that's an indication of the Holy Spirit\".\n\nInstead of accepting his cardinals' congratulations while seated on the papal throne, Francis received them standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at the Vatican. During his first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta used by previous popes. He also wore the same iron pectoral cross that he had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by his predecessors.\n\nAfter being elected and choosing his name, his first act was bestowing the Urbi et Orbi blessing on thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square. Before blessing the crowd, he asked those in St. Peter's Square to pray for his predecessor, \"the bishop emeritus of Rome\" Pope Benedict XVI, and for himself as the new \"bishop of Rome\".\n\nFrancis held his papal inauguration on 19 March 2013 in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. He celebrated Mass in the presence of various political and religious leaders from around the world. In his homily Francis focused on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the liturgical day on which the Mass was celebrated.\n\nName \n\nAt his first audience on 16 March 2013, Francis told journalists that he had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because he was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. He explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that he would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cláudio Hummes had embraced him and whispered, \"Don't forget the poor\", which had made Bergoglio think of the saint. Bergoglio had previously expressed his admiration for St. Francis, explaining that \"He brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. He changed history.\"\n\nThis is the first time that a pope has been named Francis. On the day of his election, the Vatican clarified that his official papal name was \"Francis\", not \"Francis I\", i.e. no regnal number is used for him. A Vatican spokesman said that the name would become Francis I if and when there is a Francis II. It is the first time since Lando's 913–914 pontificate that a serving pope holds a name not used by a predecessor.\n\nFrancis also said that some cardinal electors had jokingly suggested to him that he should choose either \"Adrian\", since Adrian VI had been a reformer of the church, or \"Clement\" to settle the score with Clement XIV, who had suppressed the Jesuit order. In February 2014, it was reported that Bergoglio, had he been elected in 2005, would have chosen the pontifical name of \"John XXIV\" in honor of John XXIII. It was said that he told Cardinal Francesco Marchisano: \"John, I would have called myself John, like the Good Pope; I would have been completely inspired by him\".\n\nCuria \n\nOn 16 March 2013, Francis asked all those in senior positions of the Roman Curia to provisionally continue in office. He named Alfred Xuereb as his personal secretary. On 6 April he named José Rodríguez Carballo as secretary for the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, a position that had been vacant for several months. Francis abolished the bonuses paid to Vatican employees upon the election of a new pope, amounting to several million Euros, opting instead to donate the money to charity. He also abolished the €25,000 annual bonus paid to the cardinals serving on the Board of Supervisors for the Vatican bank.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, he named eight cardinals to a new Council of Cardinal Advisers to advise him on revising the organizational structure of the Roman Curia. The group included several known as critics of Vatican operations and only one member of the Curia. They are Giuseppe Bertello, president of the Vatican City State governorate; Francisco Javier Errazuriz Ossa from Chile; Oswald Gracias from India; Reinhard Marx from Germany; Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; George Pell from Australia; Seán O'Malley from the United States; and Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga from Honduras. He appointed Bishop Marcello Semeraro secretary for the group and scheduled its first meeting for 1–3 October.\n\nEarly issues \nIn March 2013, 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked Francis to allow married men in Great Britain to be ordained as priests, keeping celibacy as the rule for bishops. They asked it on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men cannot do the same.\n\nFouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, included a call in his 2013 Easter homily for the pope to visit Jerusalem. Louis Raphael I, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, asked the pope to visit the \"embattled Christian community\" in Iraq. In March 2021, Pope Francis went to Iraq on a first-ever papal visit to the diminishing Christian communities of Mesopotamia fallen apart after years of conflict.\n\nOn the first Holy Thursday following his election, Francis washed and kissed the feet of ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility, telling them the ritual of foot washing is a sign that he is at their service. This was the first time that a pope had included women in this ritual; although he had already done so when he was archbishop. One of the male and one of the female prisoners were Muslim.\n\nOn 31 March 2013, Francis used his first Easter homily to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea. He also spoke out against those who give in to \"easy gain\" in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment. He said that \"[w]e ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\" Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, Francis chose not to read them. According to the Vatican, the pope \"at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See\".\n\nIn 2013, Francis initially reaffirmed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's program to reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The New York Times reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the sisters' group was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine. However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close. While the timing of the closure may have anticipated a visit by Francis to the U.S. in September 2015, it was noted that the sisters' emphasis is close to that of Francis.\n\nOn 12 May, Francis carried out his first canonizations of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena, the second female Mexican saint, María Guadalupe García Zavala, both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto. He said: \"While we venerate the martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give them the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness.\"\n\nSynodal church \n\nFrancis has overseen synods on the family (2014), on youth (2018), and on the Church in the Amazon region (2019). In 2019 Francis' apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio allowed that the final document of a synod may become magisterial teaching simply with papal approval. The constitution also allowed for laity to contribute input directly to the synod's secretary general. Some analysts see the creation of a truly synodal church as likely to become the greatest contribution of Francis' papacy.\n\nConsultation with Catholic laity \n\nA February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time shows how the unity Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. In the same month Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire described as a \"much broader consultation than just a survey\" regarding opinions among the laity. He continued to assert Catholic doctrine, in less dramatic tone than his recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.\n\nLinda Woodhead of Lancaster University wrote of the survey Francis initiated, \"it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.\" Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.\n\nThe Catholic Church in England and Wales  had refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in Germany and Austria, published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.\n\nIn a column he wrote for the Vatican's semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the then-Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, American cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who has a long-standing reputation as one of the church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that Francis opposed both abortion and gay marriage. The Vatican's chief spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, also noted in the Vatican press office during the 2014 consistory meetings that Francis and Cardinal Walter Kasper would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to Church theology on doctrinal matters.\n\nInstitute for the Works of Religion \nIn the first months of Francis's papacy, the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank, said that it would become more transparent in its financial dealings There had long been allegations of corruption and money laundering connected with the bank. Francis appointed a commission to advise him about reform of the Bank, and the finance consulting firm Promontory Financial Group was assigned to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all customer contacts of the bank on these facts. Because of this affair the Promoter of Justice at the Vatican Tribunal applied a letter rogatory for the first time in the history of the Republic of Italy at the beginning of August 2013. In January 2014, Francis replaced four of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacy. Lay experts and clerics were looking into how the bank was run. Ernst von Freyberg was put in charge. Moneyval feels more reform is needed, and Francis may be willing to close the bank if the reforms prove too difficult. There is uncertainty how far reforms can succeed.\n\nPapal documents \nOn 29 June 2013, Francis published the encyclical Lumen fidei, which was largely the work of Benedict XVI but awaiting a final draft at his retirement. On 24 November 2013, Francis published his first major letter as pope, the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium, which he described as the programmatic of his papacy. On 18 June 2015, he published his first own, original encyclical Laudato si' concerning care for the planet. On 8 April 2016, Francis published his second apostolic exhortation, Amoris laetitia, remarking on love within the family. Controversy arose at the end of 2016 when four cardinals formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.\n\nHis motu proprios include Ai nostri tempi and De concordia inter codices. Francis issued another titled Maiorem hac dilectionem which created a new path towards canonization for certain causes.\n\nHe established two new Secretariats (top-level departments) in the Roman Curia: the Secretariat for the Economy, and the Secretariat for Communications. He simplified the process for declaring matrimonial nullity.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Francis signed a new apostolic constitution on ecclesiastical universities and faculties Veritatis gaudium, published 29 January 2018.\n\nA further Apostolic Exhortation, Gaudete et exsultate (Rejoice and be glad), was published on 19 March 2018, dealing with \"the call to holiness in today's world\" for all persons. He counters contemporary versions of the gnostic and Pelagian heresies and describes how Jesus' beatitudes call people to \"go against the flow\".\n\nIn February 2019, Francis acknowledged that priests and bishops were sexually abusing religious sisters. He addressed this and the clergy sex abuse scandal by convening a summit on clergy sexual abuse in Rome 21–24 February 2019. As a follow-up to that summit, on 9 May 2019 Francis promulgated the motu proprio Vos estis lux mundi which specified responsibilities, including reporting directly to the Holy See on bishops and on one's superior, while simultaneously involving another bishop in the archdiocese of the accused bishop.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, he published the apostolic letter Scripturae sacrae affectus to celebrate the 16th centenary of the death of Jerome.\n\nOn 4 October 2020 on the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, Francis published the encyclical Fratelli tutti on fraternity and social friendship, using St. Francis' own words to describe our universal brotherhood and sisterhood.\n\nOn 8 December 2020 on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Francis published the apostolic letter Patris corde (\"With a Father's Heart\"). To mark the occasion, the Pope proclaimed a \"Year of Saint Joseph\" from 8 December 2020, to 8 December 2021 on the 150th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Saint Joseph as Patron of the Universal Church.\n\nOn 1 June 2021, Francis published the apostolic constitution Pascite gregem Dei.\n\nPope Francis issued the motu proprio Traditionis custodes on 16 July 2021. The document abrogated the permissions for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass previously established by Benedict XVI in the 2007 Summorum Pontificum, with Traditionis custodes instituting increased restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. Pope Francis stated in a letter accompanying the motu proprio that emphasizing the Mass of Paul VI would bring \"unity I intend to re-establish throughout the Church of the Roman Rite.\"\n\nEcumenism and interreligious dialogue \n\nPope Francis continued in the tradition of the Second Vatican Council and of the papacies since the Council in promoting ecumenism with other Christian denominations, as well as encouraging dialogue with leaders of other religions; he has also supported peace with those claiming no religious belief.\n\nClerical titles \n\nIn January 2014, Francis said that he would appoint fewer monsignors and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, chaplain of His Holiness. It would be awarded only to diocesan priests at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.\n\nCanonizations and beatifications \n\nFrancis presided over the first canonizations of his pontificate on 12 May 2013 in which he canonized the Martyrs of Otranto. Antonio Primaldo and his 812 companions who had been executed by the Ottomans in 1480, as well as the religious sisters Laura of St. Catherine of Siena and María Guadalupe García Zavala – in this first canonization he surpassed the record of Pope John Paul II in canonizing the most saints in a pontificate. Francis approved the equipollent canonization of Angela of Foligno the following 9 October and then the Jesuit Peter Faber the following 17 December.\n\nThe pope approved further equipollent canonizations on 3 April 2014 for the Jesuit José de Anchieta as well as the Ursuline nun Marie of the Incarnation and bishop François de Laval. Francis canonized his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II on 27 April 2014 and canonized six additional saints the following 23 November. The pope canonized Joseph Vaz on his visit to Sri Lanka on 14 January 2015 and canonized a further four saints on the following 17 May; he canonized Junípero Serra on 23 September while visiting the United States and then canonized four saints on 18 October including the first married couple to be named as saints. Francis canonized Maria Elisabeth Hesselblad and Stanislaus Papczyński on 5 June 2016 and then canonized Teresa of Calcutta on 4 September; he canonized seven additional saints on 16 October. The pope canonized the two child visionaries Francisco and Jacinta Marto during his visit to Fátima in mid-2017 and canonized 35 additional saints on 15 October. Francis recognized seven saints on 14 October 2018, chief among them, his predecessor Pope Paul VI and Óscar Romero. Francis later confirmed the equipollent canonization for Bartholomew of Braga in mid-2019. On 13 October 2019, Francis canonized five new saints, including Cardinal John Henry Newman. The pope confirmed the equipollent canonization for Margherita della Metola on 24 April 2021.\n\nThe pope has also continued the practice of having beatifications celebrated in the place of the individual's origin though has presided over beatifications himself on three occasions: for Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions on 16 August 2014, his predecessor Pope Paul VI on 19 October 2014, and two Colombian martyrs on 8 September 2017. The pope has approved beatifications for a range of men and women including the likes of Álvaro del Portillo of Opus Dei (27 September 2014), the martyred archbishop Óscar Romero (23 May 2015), the prominent Polish cardinal Stefan Wyszyński (12 September 2021), and several large groups of Spanish martyrs.\n\nFrancis also confirmed his predecessor John Paul I to be Venerable on 8 November 2017.\n\nDoctors of the Church \nOn 21 February 2015, Francis signed a decree naming Saint Gregory of Narek as the 36th Doctor of the Church; he formally conferred the title upon the saint at a ceremony held in Saint Peter's Basilica on 12 April 2015 with delegations from the Armenian Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church present. On 20 January 2022, Francis provided his approval to the suggestion to name Saint Irenaeus of Lyon as the 37th Doctor of the Church, formally conferring the title upon him, along with the supplementary title Doctor unitatis (\"Doctor of Unity\") in a decree issued on 21 January.\n\nConsistories \n\nAt the first consistory of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as Chibly Langlois from Haiti and Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso. The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, appeared together in public.\n\nBenedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar and Soane Patita Paini Mafi of Tonga.\n\nFrancis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as Patrick D'Rozario from Bangladesh and Dieudonné Nzapalainga from the Central African Republic, while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.\n\nThe pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of five new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.\n\nFrancis presided over his fifth consistory for the elevation of 14 new cardinals on 28 June 2018. The first eleven were under the age of eighty, and therefore, were eligible to vote in a future papal conclave while the last three were over the age of eighty, and thus, ineligible to vote in a papal conclave. The pope continued the practice of naming the Vicar of Rome and a curial prefect as cardinals, while naming his substitute for the Secretariat of State in anticipation of his transferral to a curial department. The pope also continued his practice of bestowing the red hat on those from peripheries such as Madagascar, Pakistan, and Iraq, and like in 2016, created a priest as a cardinal. The consistory was also noteworthy for the fact that Francis named the papal almoner Konrad Krajewski as a cardinal, marking the consistory the first occasion where the almoner was made a cardinal. Francis himself later said that he wanted the office of almoner to receive the red hat going forward as it was an important arm of the Vatican.\n\nOn 1 September 2019, following his weekly Sunday Angelus address, Francis unexpectedly announced the appointment of 13 new cardinals. Of these, 10 appointees were under the age of 80 and would therefore become cardinal electors, besides three over 80. The new cardinals were formally installed at the consistory celebrated on 5 October 2019. Most of the new cardinals come from the peripheries of the church and developing countries. Two new appointees were from Muslim majority countries (Morocco and Indonesia), while two others were known for their work on refugee and migration issues. This action took the number of cardinal electors appointed by Francis to the College of Cardinals to about 70 out of nearly 130.\n\nFrancis created thirteen new cardinals on 28 November 2020; nine appointees were under the age of 80, therefore, could vote in a future papal conclave. The pope also nominated four cardinals over the age of 80. Most of these new appointees continued the trend that Francis adhered to, appointing the first cardinals to represent Brunei and Rwanda. Francis also nominated the first African American cardinal (Gregory), while naming the first Conventual Franciscan (Gambetti) in almost 160 years, and the first from Siena (Lojudice) since 1801. Three of his appointees were only priests upon their nomination, therefore, two (Gambetti and Feroci) received their episcopal consecration, while one (Cantalamessa) was granted a papal dispensation from it.\n\nYear of Mercy \n\nWith his April 2015 papal bull of indiction, Misericordiae Vultus (Latin: \"The Face of Mercy\"), Francis inaugurated a Special Jubilee Year of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the last Sunday before Advent and the Solemnity of the Feast of Christ the King of the Universe on 20 November 2016.\n\nThe Holy Doors of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special \"Doors of Mercy\" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion. During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called \"Missionaries of Mercy\" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's Apostolic Penitentiary.\n\nFrancis established the World Day of the Poor in his Apostolic Letter, Misericordia et Misera, issued on 20 November 2016 to celebrate the end of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Francis canceled his regular general audiences at St. Peter's Square to prevent crowds from gathering and spreading the virus, which seriously affected Italy. He encouraged priests to visit patients and health workers; urged the faithful not to forget the poor during the time of crisis; offered prayers for victims of the virus in China; and invoked the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title Salus Populi Romani, as the Diocese of Rome observed a period of prayer and fasting in recognition of the victims. The pontiff reacted with displeasure on 13 March 2020, at the news that the Vicar General had closed all churches in the Diocese of Rome. Despite Italy being under a quarantine lockdown, Francis pleaded \"not to leave the ... people alone\" and worked to partially reverse the closures.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Francis asked the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development (DPIHD) to create a Vatican COVID-19 Commission to express the Church's concern for the crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and propose responses to the potential socio-economic challenges deriving from it.\n\nOn 27 March, Francis gave an extraordinary benediction Urbi et Orbi. In his homily on calming the storm in the Gospel of Mark, Francis described the setting: \"Dense darkness has thickened on our squares, streets and cities; it looks over our lives filling everything with a deafening silence and a desolate void that paralyzes everything in its passage: you can feel it in the air, you can feel it in your gestures. ...In the face of suffering, where the true development of our peoples is measured, we discover and experience the priestly prayer of Jesus: 'may all be one'.\"\n\nFrancis maintains getting COVID vaccination is a moral obligation.  Francis stated that people had a responsibility to look after themselves, “and this translates into respect for the health of those around us. Health care is a moral obligation”, he stated.<ref>Pope Francis has said getting vaccinated against coronavirus is a “moral obligation” and denounced how naysayers had been swayed by “baseless information”. The Guardian;;</ref>\n\n Russo-Ukrainian War \nFollowing the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Francis visited the Russian embassy in Rome in what was described as an \"unprecedented move.\" Francis called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating his \"sorrow\" as the Vatican worked to find \"room for negotiation.\" As the invasion began, the major archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk cancelled a trip to visit Francis in Florence. On 25 February, the day after the invasion began, Francis would assure Shevchuk via a phone call that \"he would do everything he can to help end the Ukraine conflict.\" During the 27 February Angelus address, Francis called for peace, saying, \"Silence the weapons!\"\n\n Role of women \n\nOn 11 January 2021, Francis allowed bishops to institute women to the ministries of acolyte and lector. While these instituted ministries were previously reserved to men, Catholic women already carry out these duties without institution in most of the world. Francis wrote that these ministries are fundamentally distinct from those reserved to ordained clergy.\n\nIn February 2021, Francis announced back-to-back appointments of women to take positions that were only held by men in the past. He appointed France’s member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, Nathalie Becquart as the first co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops. Besides, an Italian magistrate, Catia Summaria also became the first woman Promoter of Justice in the Vatican’s Court of Appeals.\n\n Financial corruption \nFrancis was mandated by electing cardinals to sort out Vatican finances following scandals during the papacies of Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II.  He stated he is determined to end corruption in the Catholic Church but is not very optimistic due to a human problem dating back centuries.\n\n Theological emphases \n\nIn Evangelii gaudium Francis revealed what would be the emphases of his pontificate: a missionary impulse among all Catholics, sharing the faith more actively, avoiding worldliness and more visibly living the gospel of God's mercy, and helping the poor and working for social justice.\n\n Evangelization \n\nFrom his first major letter Evangelii gaudium (Joy to the World), Francis called for \"a missionary and pastoral conversion\" whereby the laity would fully share in the missionary task of the church. Then in his letter on the call of all to the same holiness, Gaudete et exsultate, Fancis describes holiness as \"an impulse to evangelize and to leave a mark in this world\".\n\n Church governance \n\nFrancis called for decentralization of governance away from Rome, and for a synodal manner of decision making in dialogue with the people. He strongly opposed clericalism and made women full members of the Church's dicasteries in Rome.\n\n Environment \nFrancis' naming of himself after Francis of Assisi was an early indication of how he shared Francis' care for all of creation. This was followed in May 2015 with his major encyclical on the environment, Laudato si' (Praise be to you).\n\n Option for the poor \n\nFrancis has highly extolled \"popular movements\", which demonstrate the \"strength of us\", serve as a remedy to the \"culture of the self\", and are based on solidarity with the poor and the common good.\n\n Morality \nCardinal Walter Kasper has called mercy \"the key word of his pontificate.\" His papal motto Miserando atque eligendo (\"by having mercy and by choosing\") contains a central theme of his papacy, God's mercy, While maintaining the Church's traditional teaching against abortion, Francis, has referred to the \"obsession\" of some Catholics with a few issues like \"abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods\" which \"do not show the heart of the message of Jesus Christ.”\n\n LGBT \n\nIn June 2013, Francis suggested that \"if a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Later, in 2015, he declared that \"the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage.\" He has also suggested that same-sex marriage \"disfigures God's plan for creation.\"\n\nHe stated that he supports legally recognising same-sex civil unions in a statement from an interview published in October 2020; this passage was from an interview from 2019, but this passage had been cut from public releases at the time. The statement was also interpreted as supportive of LGBT adoption.What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable because of it.\nHowever, Vatican later clarified that his comments were taken out of context with two comments to two different questions at different times spliced together in a very misleading way. Francis has never officially pronounced support for gay civil unions. Francis also endorsed the 2015 Slovak same-sex marriage referendum which would have banned same-sex adoptions in the country.\n\nIn January 2022, Francis said during a weekly audience that parents of gay children should offer support to their children instead of condemning them.\n\n Religious persecution \n\nFrancis supported the use of force to stop Islamic militants from attacking religious minorities in Iraq. In January 2018, Francis met with a group of Yazidi refugees in Europe and expressed his support for their right to freely profess their own faith without limitations. In the meeting, he also urged the international community \"not to remain a silent and unresponsive spectator in the face of [your] tragedy.\"\n\n Controversies \nSince 2016, criticism against Francis by theological conservatives has intensified. One commentator has described the conservative resistance against Francis as \"unique in its visibility\" in recent Church history. Some have explained the level of disagreement as due to his going beyond theoretical principles to pastoral discernment.\n\n Sexual abuse response \n\nAs cardinal, in 2010 Bergoglio commissioned a study which concluded that Father Julio Grassi, a priest convicted of child sexual abuse, was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case against him never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against Grassi in March 2017. Francis has admitted that the Church \"arrived late\" in dealing with sexual abuse cases. During his papacy, a number of abuse survivors have expressed disappointment in Francis's response to sex abuse in the Church while others have praised him for his actions.\n\nIn 2015, Francis was criticized for supporting Chilean bishop Juan Barros, who was accused of covering up sex crimes committed against minors. In 2018, Francis acknowledged he had made \"grave errors\" in judgment about Barros, apologized to the victims and launched a Vatican investigation that resulted in the resignation of Barros and two other Chilean bishops. In 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò published an open letter denouncing Francis's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Theodore McCarrick, accusing him of knowing about allegations that McCarrick had committed sexual abuse and failing to take action. Viganò called on the Pope to resign.\n\nIn November 2021, Francis thanked journalists for their \"mission\" on uncovering sex abuse scandals in the Church, adding that it made of the cases \"less obscure (...) to make those who live it less fear it.\"\n\n Theological disagreements \n Amoris laetitia and the communion to the divorced and civilly remarried \n\nOn a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia, especially regarding whether the exhortation had changed the Catholic Church's sacramental discipline concerning access to the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist for divorced couples who have civilly remarried. Francis had written that \"It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church.\" He called not for \"a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases,\" but \"a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases.\" He went on to say: “It is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.”\n\nFour cardinals (Raymond Leo Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, and Joachim Meisner) formally asked Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics. They submitted five \"dubia\" (doubts), and requested a yes or no answer. Francis has not publicly replied. The exhortation has been implemented in different ways by various bishops around the world.\n\nCardinal Gerhard Müller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, maintained that Amoris Laetitia should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal Müller, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist only if they take on the duty of living in complete continence. Francis subsequently announced that dicastery prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced Müller at the end of his term in 2017 with Luis Ladaria Ferrer. Cardinal Carlo Caffarra, one of the authors of the dubia, maintains that after Amoris laetitia \"only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Church.\"\n\nIn July 2017 a group of conservative clergy, academics and laymen signed a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis. The 25-page document, which was made public in September after it received no reply, criticized the pope for promoting what it described as seven heretical propositions through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate. Capuchin Father Thomas Weinandy, ex-doctrine chief of US Bishops, wrote a letter to Francis on 31 July 2017, which he subsequently made public, in which he charged that Francis is fostering \"chronic confusion\", \"demeaning\" the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who \"scandalize\" believers with dubious \"teaching and pastoral practice\", giving prelates who object the impression they will be \"marginalized or worse\" if they speak out, and causing faithful Catholics to \"lose confidence in their supreme shepherd\".\n\n Document on Human Fraternity \n\nThe Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is a joint statement signed by Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, on 4 February 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This joint statement is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the \"pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, through which He created human beings\". Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that this sentence was \"puzzling, and potentially problematic\". Some Catholic observers tried to understand it as an allusion to the \"permissive will\" of God, allowing evil on earth. Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be \"evidence of our natural desire to know God\". On 8 February 2019 Bishop Athanasius Schneider released a document entitled \"The Gift of Filial Adoption, the Christian Faith: the only valid and the only God-willed religion\".\n\n Traditionis custodes and the restriction of the Tridentine Mass \n\nIn July 2021, Francis issued, motu proprio, the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which reversed the decision of his immediate predecessor Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. The letter returned to the bishops the power to grant or suppress the Latin Mass in their particular dioceses, and requires newly ordained priests to first request permission before performing the old rite, among other changes. \"Traditionis Custodes, which Pope Francis published and came into immediate effect on July 16, has been criticized by prelates such as Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard Müller and Joseph Zen, as well as many lay faithful who attend the traditional Latin Mass, also called Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. The most general criticism is that the restrictions are unnecessary, needlessly harsh, and implemented in an unjustifiably swift fashion.\"\n\n International policy \n\nFrancis has regularly been accused by conservatives of having a \"soft spot\" for leftist populist movements. After Francis's visit to Cuba in 2015, Catholic Yale historian Carlos Eire said Francis had a \"preferential option for the oppressors\" in Cuba. Nevertheless, Francis remained hostile to right-wing populism.\n\nFrancis has supported the Vatican-China agreement, intended to normalize the situation of China's Catholics, which was criticized by Cardinal Joseph Zen as a step towards the \"annihilation\" of the Catholic Church in China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party puts the pope's moral authority at risk. In September 2020, Pompeo urged Francis to stand against China's human rights violations. In November, Francis named China's Uyghur minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. He wrote: \"I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya [Muslims in Myanmar], the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi—what ISIS did to them was truly cruel—or Christians in Egypt and Pakistan killed by bombs that went off while they prayed in church.\" Zhao Lijian, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of China, said Francis’ remarks had \"no factual basis at all\".\n\nSince 2016, Francis has also been contrasted with US President Donald Trump, elected that year, with some conservative critics drawing comparisons between the two. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Francis said of Trump, \"A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. That is not the gospel.\" Trump responded, \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\" Federico Lombardi said that Francis' comments were not \"a personal attack, nor an indication of who to vote for\".\n\nIn response to criticism from Venezuela's bishops, President Nicolás Maduro said in 2017 that he had the support of Francis. Francis met with the country's bishops in June 2017, and the Venezuelan bishops' conference president stated, \"There is no distance between the episcopal conference and the Holy See.\" In January 2019, 20 former presidents in Latin America wrote a letter to Francis criticizing his Christmas address regarding the ongoing Venezuelan crisis for being too simplistic and for not acknowledging what they believed to be the causes of the suffering of the victims of the crisis. Francis has sought peace in the crisis without picking a side.\n\nIn 2019, during the Hong Kong protests, Francis was criticized by Catholic clergy in Hong Kong, with Cardinal Joseph Zen criticizing him for not taking a stand against China and instead being quoted as saying \"I would like to go to China. I love China\". Francis compared the protests in Hong Kong to those seen in Chile and in France.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country, Francis said that the withdrawal of troops was \"legitimate\" but said that the process of evacuations was \"not thought through\" and criticized the war for having failed at nation-building. He also stated that the Vatican is in talks with the Taliban through Cardinal Pietro Parolin to discourage the Taliban on taking reprisal measures against civilians.\n\n International diplomatic role \n\nFrancis played a key role in the talks toward restoring full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The restoration was jointly announced by U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro on 17 December 2014. The headline in the Los Angeles Times on 19 December was \"Bridge to Cuba via Vatican,\" with the further lead \"In a rare and crucial role, Francis helped keep U.S. talks with Havana on track and guided final deal.\" The pope, along with the Government of Canada, was a behind-the-scenes broker of the agreement, taking the role following President Obama's request during his visit to the pope in March 2014. The success of the negotiations was credited to Francis because \"as a religious leader with the confidence of both sides, he was able to convince the Obama and Castro administrations that the other side would live up to the deal\". En route to the United States for a visit in September 2015, the pope stopped in Cuba. \"The plan comes amid a breakthrough for which Francis has received much credit.\" The Cuba visit \"seals that accomplishment, in which he served as a bridge between two erstwhile enemies\". According to one expert on religion in Latin America, Mario Paredes, the pope's visit to Cuba was consistent with his aim to promote an understanding of the role of the Cuban Revolution and that of the Catholic Church. When Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he authored a text entitled \"Dialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro\". John Paul was the first pope to visit Cuba. In May 2015, Francis met with Cuban leader Raúl Castro. After the meeting in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he was considering returning to the Catholic Church. He said in a televised news conference, \"I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Catholic] church. I am not joking.\" Castro said that, when the pope came, \"I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction\".\n\nIn May 2014, his visit to the State of Israel, where he delivered 13 speeches, was heavily publicized. Protests against his visit resulted in an alleged arson attempt at the Dormition Abbey. The cave under the Church of the Nativity caught fire the night after his visit.\n\nIn May 2015, Francis welcomed Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to the Vatican. Several media outlets reported that Francis praised Abbas as \"an angel of peace\", though his actual words were the following: \"The angel of peace destroys the evil spirit of war. I thought about you: may you be an angel of peace.\" The Vatican signed a treaty recognizing the state of Palestine. The Vatican issued statements concerning the hope that the peace talks could resume between Israel and Palestine. Abbas' visit was on the occasion of the canonization of two Palestinian nuns.\n\nOn 6 June 2015, Francis visited Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He urged peace during his time in the religiously diverse city, known as the \"Jerusalem of Europe\".\n\nOn 25 September 2015, Francis addressed the United Nations in New York City.\n\nOn 16 April 2016, he visited, together with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronimos II of Athens, the Moria Refugee Camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, to call the attention of the world to the refugee issue. There the three Christian leaders signed a joint declaration.\n\nIn January 2017, Francis demanded the resignation of Matthew Festing, the 79th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Pope's demand came as a response to Festing and Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke firing Baron Albrecht von Boeselager from his position in the Order of Malta. The Order, in May 2017, appointed a new leader in the person of Fra' Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto.\n\nOn 24 May 2017, Francis met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vatican City, where they discussed the contributions of Catholics to the United States and to the world. They discussed issues of mutual concern, including how religious communities can combat human suffering in crisis regions, such as Syria, Libya, and ISIS-controlled territory. They also discussed terrorism and the radicalization of young people. The Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, raised the issue of climate change and encouraged Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. At the 2017 World Food Day ceremony, Francis reiterated that \"we see the consequences [of climate change] every day\" and that we \"know how the problems are to be faced ... [t]hanks to scientific knowledge.\" He said that \"the international community has drawn up the necessary legal instruments, such as the Paris Agreement, from which however some are withdrawing. There is a re-emergence of the nonchalance towards the delicate balances of ecosystems, the presumption of being able to manipulate and control the planet's limited resources, and greed for profit.\"\n\nFrancis visited Ireland in 2018, in what was the first papal tour of the country since John Paul II's historic trip in 1979. While in Ireland he apologized for abuses by clergy in the United States and Ireland.\n\nIn February 2019, Francis visited Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the invitation of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Francis became the first pope to hold a papal Mass on the Arabian Peninsula, with more than 120,000 attendees in the Zayed Sports City Stadium.\n\nFrancis made the plight of refugees and migrants \"a core component of his pastoral work\", and has defended their rights in dialogue both with Europe and with the United States. He went on to place a statue in St. Peter's Square to bring attention to the Christian imperative involved in their situation (Hebrews 13:2).\n\nIn March 2021, Pope Francis held a historic meeting with Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, Ur. Giving a message of peaceful coexistence, he and the Iraqi cleric urged the Muslim and Christian communities to work together in unity for peace.\n\nOn 9 May 2021, Francis called for peace between Israel and Palestinians and an end to clashes in Jerusalem during his Regina caeli address.\n\nOn 1 September 2021, Francis publicly defended the dialogue with China on the appointment of new bishops. Francis stated that uneasy dialogue was better than no dialogue at all, and emphasized in improving strained ties with the Chinese government.\n\nOn All Souls' Day, on 1 November 2021, Francis visited a war cemetery in Rome and paid tribute to fallen soldiers during the Battle of Anzio in World War II as well as at the Piave River, in Italy, during World War I. Francis also praised military casualties for \"fighting for their homeland and values.\" and called for global peace.\n\n Public image \n\nPopular mainstream media frequently portray Francis either as a progressive papal reformer or with liberal, moderate values. The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less-doctrinal tone of papacy, in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message. In the news media, both faithful and non-believers often refer to a \"honeymoon\" phase in which the pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated ecclesiastical reform in the Vatican. Media systems differ, too, not only in their coverage of Francis's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed. His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example. During this trip, American-based AP and British-based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope's journey while Prensa Latina, the official state media agency, depicted it as a diplomatic visit. American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media, which showed Francis interacting with elites most often.\n\nIn December 2013, both Time and The Advocate magazines named the Pontiff as their \"Person of the Year\" in praise and hopes of reforming the Roman Curia while hoping to change the Catholic Church's doctrine on various controversial issues. In addition, Esquire magazine named him as the \"Best-dressed man\" for 2013 for his simpler vestments often in tune with a modern simplistic design on sartorial fashion. Rolling Stone magazine followed in January 2014 by making the Pontiff their featured front cover. Fortune magazine also ranked Francis as number one in their list of 50 greatest leaders. On 5 November 2014, he was ranked by Forbes as the fourth most powerful person in the world and was the only non-political figure in the top ranking. In December 2016, Francis again made Forbess list of \"The World's Most Powerful People\", ranking fifth.\n\nIn March 2013, a new song was dedicated to Francis and released in Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, and Italian, titled Come Puoi (\"How You Can\"). Also in March, Pablo Buera, the mayor of La Plata, Argentina, announced that the city had renamed a section of a street leading up to a local cathedral Papa Francisco. There are already efforts to name other streets after him, as well as a school where he studied as a child. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Francis was made in Argentina's lower house on 28 November 2013. On the coins it would read, \"Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis.\" beneath his face. As of May 2013, sales of papal souvenirs, a sign of popularity, were up.\n\nFrancis presided over his first joint public wedding ceremony in a Nuptial Mass for 20 couples from the Archdiocese of Rome on 14 September 2014, just a few weeks before the start of the 5–19 October Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family.\n\nOn 19 March 2016, Francis became the first pope to create an Instagram account. He broke records after having gained over one million followers in under twelve hours of the account being up. In 2019 Francis held a conference on the World Day of Social Communications highlighting the pros and cons of social media and urging users to use it as a source that liberates rather than enslaves. On 26 November 2020 Francis became the first pope to write an op-ed for The New York Times, addressing issues such as the coronavirus and the need for global solidarity. The Pontiff also used his op-ed to strongly critique those protesting COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIn August 2021, rumors of a possible resignation arose due to health issues, but he dismissed those rumors in early September 2021, saying that he is \"living a normal life.\"\n\n Distinctions \n\n Titles and styles \nThe official form of address of the pope in English is His Holiness Pope Francis; in Latin, Franciscus, Episcopus Romae. Holy Father is among the other honorifics used for popes.\n\n Foreign orders \n : : Grand Collar of the Order of the Condor of the Andes (9 July 2015)\n : Order of Merit \"Father Luis Espinal Camps\" (9 July 2015)\n : : Order of the Smile (26 April 2016)\n\n Awards \n : International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen 2016.\n \"Person of the Year\" by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (2015) for his request that all Catholics be kind to animals.\nWas made an honorary Harlem Globetrotter on 7 May 2015.\nZayed Award for Human Fraternity in October 2020 for significant contributions to the service of humanity from around the world.\n\n Academic honors \n Honorary Sommelier Diploma of the Italian Sommelier Association (2015).\n\n Honorific eponyms and dedications \n\n : The Pope Francis Center for the Poor – Palo, Leyte (12 July 2015)\n Ennio Morricone composed a Mass setting (Missa Papae Francisci) named after the pope, for the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the restoration of the Jesuit order.

First performance: Capella Mariana 4 October 2015.\n\n Appreciation \nIn the oratorio Laudato si' by Peter Reulein (music) written on a libretto by Helmut Schlegel OFM, the figure of Francis appears next to Mary, Francis of Assisi, and Clare of Assisi. In the oratorio, Pope Franziskus suggests a bridge from the crucifixion scene on Golgotha to the suffering of the present. He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the encyclicals Laudato si' and Evangelii gaudium were used. The motto of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy also plays a central role. The oratorio was premiered on 6 November 2016 in the Limburg Cathedral.\n\n Coat of arms \n\n Writings \n\nPope Francis has written a variety of books, encyclicals, and other writings.\n\n Music album Wake Up! was released on 27 November 2015 by the label Believe Digital and contains speeches by Francis and accompanying music, including rock music.\n\n Films \n Documentary film \nBy 2015, there were two biographical films about Francis: Call Me Francesco (Italy, 2015), starring Rodrigo de la Serna, and Francis: Pray for me (Argentina, 2015), starring Darío Grandinetti.Pope Francis: A Man of His Word is a documentary film with Swiss-Italian-French-German co-production, co-written and directed by Wim Wenders.

He was elected on 13 March 2013 by a two-thirds majority of the eligible cardinals in the 2013 papal conclave that followed the resignation of his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Ordained as a priest in 1969 in his native Argentina, Bergoglio embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1970s. He was appointed a full professor in 1980 at the age of 43. After a long career as a professor of theology and an academic administrator, Bergoglio was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. In 2001, he was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 2008, he was elected to the position of dean of the College of Cardinals. Bergoglio's pastoral style was different from that of his predecessors. He placed a strong emphasis on the Catholic Church's social teaching, and was considered a \"pope of the poor\" due to his extensive work with the poor and his critique of the political and economic system that neglects them. He was described as \"the main intellectual force in the Church\" since the mid-1980s. On 11 February 2013, Benedict XVI announced his resignation, citing a \"lack of strength of mind and body\" due to his advanced age. He was the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415 and the first on a pope's initiative since Celestine V in 1294. After the conclave that followed his resignation, Bergoglio was elected to the office of pope on 13 March 2013 and was installed on 13 April 2013. Bergoglio's handling of sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church and opposition to the usage of condoms in areas of high HIV transmission, despite their effectiveness in preventing the spread of HIV, led to substantial criticism from public health officials, anti-AIDS activists, and victims' rights organizations.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1687680}

Situated on the Hun River (\"muddy river\"), it is one of the industrial and economic development hubs in Liaoning.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ming dynasty first constructed Fushun walled city in 1384. \"Fushun\" is an abbreviation of the Chinese \"(\", literally \"to pacify the frontiers; to guide the Yi foreigners\".\n\nThe Jurchen (Manchu) leader Nurhaci married his granddaughter by his son Abatai to the Ming dynasty General Li Yongfang after Li surrendered Fushun in 1618. The offspring of Li received the \"Third Class Viscount\" () title.\n\nFushun was in ruins in the one-and-a-half centuries of early Qing dynasty. In 1783, the new walled city was completed southwest of the old city. In 1908, Fushun became the seat of Xingren County (, later renamed to Fushun County). Fushun was occupied by Russia until 1905 and by Japan until 1945. With the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia and signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the South Manchuria branch (from Changchun to Lüshun) of the China Far East Railway was transferred to Japanese control. South Manchuria Railway Company quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions. Coal mines were developed at Fushun. Under the control of the Japanese and with 30 years of development, Fushun area became highly industrialized. Fushun gained city status in 1937.\n\nPopulation\nFushun has 2.14 million inhabitants, including 1.34 million in the urban area. It is now part of the Shenyang-Fushun built-up area (comprising all the urban and suburban districts of Shenyang and Fushun) which was home to 6,756,379 inhabitants in 2010. This makes Shenyang-Fushun the 8th most populous built up area in China after the Pearl River Delta conurbation of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhongshan and Huizhou, then Shanghai-Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou-Shaoxing, Wuhan and Nanjing.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nFushun consists of 4 districts, 1 county and 2 autonomous counties.\n\nEconomy\n\nFushun is a highly industrialized area and nicknamed \"the City of Coal\". It has developed as a thriving center for fuel, power and raw materials and is also offering more and more opportunities in textiles and electronics. One of the world's largest open-pit coal mines, the West Open Mine, is located south of the city. Exploited from the 12th century, it was operated as an open pit mine during the 20th and early 21st Century; however, as of 2015, the West Open pit, 1,000 feet deep, with an area of 4.2 square miles, was exhausted and unstable. Total coal production in Fushun as a whole had fallen below 3 million tons, down from 18.3 million tons in 1962. Fushun has a major aluminum-reduction plant and factories producing automobiles, machinery, chemicals, cement, and rubber.\n\nThe total GDP of the city of Fushun was 54.27 billion yuan in 2009 (ranked 4th out of the 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province). The GDP per capita of the city of Fushun was 40391 yuan in 2009. (ranked 21st out of all 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province).\n\nResources\n\nFushun is rich in wood, coal, oil shale, iron, copper, magnesium, gold, marble, titanium, and marl resources.\n\nFushun is known as \"the capital of coal\". The main coal and oil shale company is Fushun Mining Group, which produced about 6 million tons of coal in 2001, mainly blending coking coal and steam coal. The company also has coalbed methane resources of around 8.9 billion cubic meters. In addition, it owns geological reserves of high grade oil shale, about 3.5 billion tons, of which the exploitable reserve is 920 million tons.\n\nIndustrial development\nHydroelectric and thermal power are important locally available energy sources.\n\nFushun has developed through the utilization of the abundant natural mineral deposits found in the area and is a nationally important heavy industrial base for petroleum, chemical, metallurgy machinery and construction material industries. New sectors also becoming prominent are electronics, light industry, weaving and spinning.\n\nIn 1928, the commercial-scale production of shale oil began in Fushun with the construction of Fushun Coal Mine Temporary Oil Plant () of South Manchurian Railway, aka the Western Refinery (), operating Fushun-type retorts. After World War II, shale oil production ceased, but 100 Fushun-type oil shale retorts and the related shale oil processing units were restored in 1949. In 1950, a total of 266 retorts were in operation, each with a capacity of 100–200 tonnes of shale oil per day. In 1954, \"Refinery No. 2\" began production and in 1959 maximum annual shale oil production increased to 780,000 tonnes.\n\nFrom 1965 oil shale usage in Fushun started to decline with the discovery of Da Qing oil field in the 1960s. Sinopec, a shale oil producer during those times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In the same year, the China National Oil Shale Association was established in Fushun.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Fushun Mining Group operated the largest shale oil plant in the world, consisting of seven retorting units with 20 retorts in each unit, for a total 140 sets of Fushun type retorts.\n\nThere are also two oil refineries. Fushun Petrochemical Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina, is building a refining and petrochemical complex in Fushun.\n\nTransportation\nFushun is located  from Shenyang Taoxian airport. Railways and highways connect the city to Shenyang and Jilin Province. The seaports of Dalian and Yingkou are also nearby,  away respectively, with good highway connections.\n\nEducation\n\nThe highest-ranked institution of higher education is the Liaoning University of Petroleum and Chemical Technology, ranked 123rd in China overall. Fushun No.1 High School and Fushun No.2 High School are major high schools in Fushun.\n\nThe 44 middle school is located in the second street, Xin Fu District. Location is close to FuShun's CBD. Transport is very convenient.  All students come from this community. Because of the population's decline in current years there are not many students compared to 10 years ago. There were over 1000 students in the 1990S, while now around 200 students.\nAlthough the number of students has dropped, the quality of education, the advanced learning facilities and modern school are still evident. \nThere are indoors gymnasium, big dance and musical instrument rooms. The play yard is all about synthetic surface track. \nThe 44 middle school is actually changed in term of their learning and teaching's facilities, equipment and school's building. \nIt represents new outlooks regarding middle-level education in a third-line city in China.\n\nTourism\n\nFushun has high mountains and thick woods. Houshi National Forest Park, about  from Fushun city centre, is rated by the central government as an AAAA tourist attraction. Saer Hu Scenic Area covers some . It includes the  Dahuofang Reservoir, the largest man-made lake in northeast China.\n\nThere are a number of historic and cultural sites. Fushun's success in applying for two UNESCO World Heritage sites is expected to attract more tourists. They include a site known as Xingjing City, the origin of the Qing Dynasty, which is within today's Fushun. It was the first capital of the Late Jin dynasty, dating to 1616. The second site contains the Yongling tombs, where several members of the royal household are buried.\n\nIn more recent times, Fushun was where Lei Feng was stationed as a soldier and died, and a memorial museum telling his life story is a popular attraction. It is located at Wang Hua District in Fushun. It was also in Fushun that the last emperor, Puyi, was imprisoned after the end of World War II. The Fushun War Criminals Management Centre is converted into a museum in 1986. Another war memorial, the Pingdingshan Tragedy Memorial Hall Ruins, tells the story of a massacre of Chinese people by the Japanese in 1931. It was rebuilt and expanded in 2007. It includes a pit filled with about 800 bodies—largely infants, adults, and the elderly who were killed by the Japanese.\n\nThe Ring of Life monument opened in 2013 and features an observation deck overseeing the city. This circular tower, 515-foot (approximately 157 meters) tall, cost over $15 million to build. It is covered with 12,000 LED lights.\n\nIn addition, Red River Valley in Fushun has opened a number of summer resorts. Tourists can travel down the river on small rubber rafts through mountain scenery; the valley is called 'the first rafting route in northern China'. Fushun Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall. This is a memorial to a large massacre that occurred in Fushun.\n\nSports\nThe city used to be home of the Chinese Super League (soccer) team of Liaoning FC at Leifeng Stadium. However, when the team could not afford the rent at the Leifeng Stadium it moved to Beijing, where it now plays out of Chaolai Soccer Base in the northeastern part of that city.\n\nNotable figures\n Nurhaci, the first Manchu ruler, was born in today's Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County. \n Lei Feng, who was a soldier enshrined in new China history after 1949, died in this city. There is a memorial park named after him in Fushun's Wanghua District.\n Li Xianglan, also known as Yoshiko Otaka, Yoshiko Yamaguchi, or Shirley Yamaguchi, was a famous Fushun-born ethnic Japanese singer and movie star in China during the 1930s and 1940s.\n Wang Nan, famous table-tennis sportswoman, who has won many gold medals around the world.\n Puyi, the last Emperor of China, spent ten years in a Fushun War Criminals Management Centre.\n\nThe film The Lover starring Tony Leung Ka Fai described a love story between a young French woman and a young man from Fouchouen.\n\nSister cities\n\nInternational \n\n  Lipa City, Batangas, Philippines\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Fushun official website\n Liaoning Business Guide: Fushun\n\n \nCities in Liaoning\nPrefecture-level divisions of Liaoning", "machine_text": " Fushun is a county-level division of Fushun City, Liaoning Province, China.

In the 1930s, Fushun was the site of a large Japanese prisoner of war (POW) camp, where captured British, American, and other Allied soldiers were held. The Japanese camp was infamous for its harsh conditions, and the captors were accused of torturing and executing POWs. The Soviet Union invaded the area in the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation in the final days of World War II, and captured the city of Fushun on 16 August 1945. Fushun is home to the Fushun University, a comprehensive university with an emphasis on engineering. Fushun is known for its annual snow and ice festival, which attracts many tourists. Fushun was the site of a nuclear weapons accident on 21 May 1980. An experimental nuclear reactor, the HT-3, suffered a cooling system failure and subsequently a core-meltdown. The HT-3 was one of the test reactors designed to develop technology for the CANDU-type nuclear reactors. The accident was the second major accident in the history of the Chinese nuclear program, after the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union. The official death toll was reported as 64, although this is debated. Fushun is also the location of the main office of the Chinese Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which is responsible for dealing with nuclear accidents and radiation emergencies.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1516358}

The ICGC was formed in the spring of 1979 when the GCGC, under the leadership of general director George Freeman, voted to end its relationship with the Living Church of God (LCG), and the ECG, under the leadership of its general Overseer, David Maxwell, decided to sever its ties with the GCGC. The two churches had previously been in a state of fellowship, and had been in full fellowship up until the late 1970s. A primary reason for the breakup was a difference of opinion regarding the role of the United States in the world, particularly in light of the increasing influence of the Internet.

Before its loss, it was considered an \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". A reconstruction was made, starting in 1979 and completed and installed in the Catherine Palace in 2003.\n\nThe Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the Charlottenburg Palace, in Berlin, Prussia, but was eventually installed at the Berlin City Palace. It was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schlüter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schlüter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig (Gdańsk).\n\nIt remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his ally Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia, the room was installed in the Catherine Palace. After expansion and several renovations, it covered more than  and contained over  of amber.\n\nThe Amber Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, and taken to Königsberg for reconstruction and display. Some time in early 1944, with Allied forces closing in on Germany, the room was disassembled and crated for storage in the Castle basement.  Konigsberg was destroyed by allied bombers in August 1944 and documentation of the room location ends there.  Its eventual fate and current whereabouts, if it survives, remain a mystery. In 1979 the decision was taken to create a reconstructed Amber Room at the Catherine Palace in Pushkin. After decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, it was completed and inaugurated in 2003.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Amber Room is a priceless piece of art, with extraordinary architectural features such as gilding, carvings, 450 kg (990 lb) amber panels, gold leaf, gemstones, and mirrors, all highlighted with candle light. Additional architectural and design features include statues of angels and children.\n\nBecause of its unique features and singular beauty, the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". Modern estimates of the room's value range from $142 million (2007) to over $500 million (2016).\n\nHistory\n\nCreation\n\nThe Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophia Charlotte. The concept and design of the room was drafted by Andreas Schlüter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig, now Gdańsk in Poland.\n\nAlthough originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace, the complete panels were eventually installed at Berlin City Palace. The Amber Room did not, however, remain at Berlin City Palace for long. Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716, King Frederick I's son  Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift, which forged a Russo-Prussian alliance against Sweden.\n\nThe original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in Russia in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen. It was Peter's daughter Empress Elizabeth who decided the amber treasure should be installed at Catherine Palace, where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers. After several other 18th-century renovations, the room covered more than  and contained over  of amber. The room took over ten years to construct.\n\nEvacuation during World War II\n\nShortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room. However, over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without the amber crumbling. The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper, in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it, but the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed.\n\nGerman soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached Königsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town's castle. On 13 November 1941, a Königsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at Königsberg Castle.\n\nLast days in Königsberg\nOrders given by Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from Königsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, who was in charge of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.\n\nIn August 1944, Königsberg was heavily fire-bombed by the Royal Air Force. It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945.\n\nDisappearance and mysteries \nAfter the war, the Amber Room was never seen in public again, though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm Gustloff, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.\n\nIn 1997, an Italian stone mosaic \"Feel and Touch\" that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber. The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction.\n\nIn 1998, two separate teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two locations turned out to hold the Amber Room.\n\nIn 2004, a lengthy investigation by British investigative journalists Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy concluded that the Amber Room was most likely destroyed when Königsberg Castle was damaged, first during the bombing of Königsberg by the Royal Air Force in 1944 and then by the Soviets' burning of the castle followed by shelling of the remaining walls. Official assessments, set out in documents from the Russian National Archives written by Alexander Brusov, head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war, agreed with this theory. The official report stated: \"Summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945.\"\n\nThese dates correspond with the end of the Battle of Königsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.\n\nAmong other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: \"It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed\".\n\nAfter the report was made public, Leonid Arinshtein, who was a lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of Königsberg, said: \"I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room\". At the same time, he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments, but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose, saying: \"What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay?\"\n\nA variation of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), is that at least parts of the room were found in the Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Königsberg Castle.\n\nThen in 1968, despite academic protests worldwide, Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev ordered the destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible. Later the search for the Amber Room continued in different locations, including near Wuppertal, Germany.\n\nAnother hypothesis involves a bunker in Mamerki in northeastern Poland, or that Stalin ordered the Amber Room replaced with a replica prior to its looting, hiding the original. The main problem with finding the Amber Room is that the Nazi regime hid many items in many difficult-to-reach places, usually without documentation, leaving a wide search area. The Germans also moved items to destinations far from Europe in some cases. The search for the Amber Room has also been halted by authorities. In the case of Frýdlant castle it was halted because of the historic value of the castle.\n\nIn October 2020 Polish divers from the Baltictech group found the wreck of the SS Karlsruhe, a ship which took part in Operation Hannibal, a sea evacuation which allowed more than a million German troops and civilians from East Prussia to escape advancing Soviet forces. The ship was attacked off the coast of Poland by Soviet aircraft after it sailed from Königsberg in 1945. The wreck holds many crates with unknown contents. An online news website, Live Science, reports that this German steamship may hold crates that contain parts of the Amber Room.\n\nReconstruction\n\nIn 1979, the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo, a process that was to take 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship. Using original drawings and old black-and-white photographs, every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room. This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room. A major problem was the lack of skilled workers, since amber carving was a nearly lost art form.\n\nThe financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of US$3.5 million from the German company E.ON. By 2003, the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.\nIn Kleinmachnow, near Berlin, there is a miniature Amber Room, fabricated after the original. The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian amber.\n\nSee also\n Art of the Third Reich\n Nazi gold train\n Siege of Leningrad\n Štěchovice Treasure\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nPrinted\n\nOnline\n\nExternal links\n\n Amber Room 3D panorama with high-resolution pictures of decor elements and function drag and zoom by Classic Studio\n Bibliographical Database of the International literature about the Amber Room by Peter Bruhn\n\nAmber\nArt museums and galleries in Russia\nBaroque architecture in Berlin\nBaroque architecture in Russia\nEkaterininsky park\nIndividual rooms\nLost works of art\nNazi-looted art\nTourist attractions in Saint Petersburg", "machine_text": " The Amber Room is a room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, Russia.

He is known for organizing national educational initiatives on climate change, which have engaged thousands of schools and universities, civic institutions, faith groups, and community organizations in solutions-driven dialogue. He is the author of three books and numerous journal articles. He and his wife, Chungin Chung Goodstein, live in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. They have three daughters.\n\nEarly life and education\nGoodstein was born and grew up in Sewanee, Tennessee. His parents were affiliated with the Highlander Research and Education Center, a networking and skills-training institute that facilitates grassroots organizing for issues of social and environmental justice throughout Appalachia and the South. In partnership with several other families, his parents helped drive the desegregation of the local Franklin County public school system in 1962, (one of 17 school districts in Tennessee still under court orders to unify their desegregated student bodies).\n\nGoodstein received his B.A. from Williams College, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nAcademic career\nGoodstein was a professor of economics at Skidmore College and Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon. In 2009 he relocated to Bard College to Direct the Center for Environmental Policy. His research centers on environmental and natural resource economics, the relationship between jobs and environmental policy, and climate economics. \nAt Bard CEP, Goodstein launched one of the nation’s first MS in Climate Science and Policy degree offerings. In 2012, with the support of Hunter Lovins, Goodstein also founded Bard’s MBA in Sustainability —one of a handful of programs globally that fully integrates sustainability into a core graduate business curriculum.\n\nGoodstein was a writer-in-residence at the Mesa Refuge Writers' Retreat, is on the steering committee of Economics for Equity and the Environment Network (E3), and the Editorial Board of Sustainability: The Journal of Record. He also serves on the Board of the Follett Corporation.\n\nClimate education\nIn 1999, Goodstein founded the Green House Network, an organization dedicated to supporting the clean energy movement. As the volunteer Executive Director of the organization, Goodstein led a series of weekend training workshops in grassroots organization and outreach, based in part on the techniques and principles of the Highlander Center, training over 600 volunteer educators. Goodstein also set up a national speakers’ bureau of climate, energy policy, and environmental experts, preceding Vice-President Al Gore's Climate Project speaker-training initiative.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Goodstein worked with Matthew Follett to produce the Race to Stop Global Warming, a 10K non-competitive footrace that involved thousands of runners and their families in eight cities across the United States. These efforts earned the Green House Network the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s \"Climate Saver's Award\".\n\nIn the winter of 2006, a rising sense of personal urgency about the need for action led Goodstein to expand the scale of his work, and launch the first of the national teach-in initiatives, Focus the Nation. Goodstein, with his wife and the project Communications Director, Chungin Chung, spent eighteen months traveling across the country, speaking and organizing on over 150 campuses. In January 2008, over 1900 universities, schools, and civic groups nationwide participated in what amounted to one of the largest teach-in in U.S. history, involving over a million people in an event designed to educate and engage Americans in a discussion of global warming solutions. Goodstein and Chung organized a second teach-in in  2009.\n\nAt Bard, Goodstein initiated and directs the C2C Fellows Program —a national network of undergraduates and recent graduates who aspire to sustainability leadership in business and politics. C2C Fellows runs weekend skills training workshops across the country, helping young people develop paths to leadership careers from which they can make a difference in the world, while in their 20s.\n\nWriting\nGoodstein's writing has appeared in a number of journals, and his research has been featured in The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Economist, The New York Times, Scientific American, Time, and USA Today.  He is the author of a college textbook, Economics and the Environment now in its 7th edition, as well as The Trade-off Myth: Fact and Fiction about Jobs and the Environment. His most recent book is Fighting for Love in the Century of Extinction: How Passion and Politics Can Stop Global Warming,.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Organizational Videos on YouTube\n\nPeople from Sewanee, Tennessee\nWriters from Portland, Oregon\nWilliams College alumni\nUniversity of Michigan alumni\n1960 births\nLiving people\nLewis & Clark College faculty\nAmerican environmentalists\nClimate activists", "machine_text": " Eban Goodstein (born November 14, 1964) is an American politician and nonprofit executive who is the former director of the ibanking division of the Piraeus Bank Group, the largest bank in Greece, and a former member of the Vermont House of Representatives.

His father, John Ostrom Enders, was CEO of the Hartford National Bank and left him a fortune of $19 million upon his death. He attended the Noah Webster School in Hartford, and St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire.  After attending Yale University a short time, he joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1918 as a flight instructor and a lieutenant.\n\nAfter returning from World War I, he graduated from Yale, where he was a member of Scroll and Key as well as Delta Kappa Epsilon. He went into real estate in 1922, and tried several careers before choosing the biomedical field with a focus on infectious diseases, gaining a Ph.D. at Harvard in 1930.

The three received the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue\".\n\nMeanwhile, Jonas Salk applied the Enders-Weller-Robbins technique to produce large quantities of poliovirus, and then developed a polio vaccine in 1952. Upon the 1954 polio vaccine field trial, whose success Salk announced on the radio, Salk became a public hero but failed to credit the many other researchers that his effort rode upon, and was somewhat shunned by America's scientific establishment.\n\nIn 1954, Enders and Thomas C. Peebles isolated measlesvirus from an 11-year-old boy, David Edmonston.  Disappointed by polio vaccine's development and involvement in some cases of polio and death—what Enders attributed to Salk's technique—Enders began development of measles vaccine.  In October 1960, an Enders team began trials on 1,500 mentally retarded children in New York City and on 4,000 children in Nigeria.\nRefusing credit for merely himself when The New York Times announced the measles vaccine effective on September 17, 1961, Enders wrote to the newspaper to acknowledge the work of various colleagues and the collaborative nature of the research.

In 1947, after a series of experiments with a new medium for growing the poliovirus, Enders and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School succeeded in isolating three different strains of the virus. One of these strains, the Type I Mahoney strain, proved to be especially useful in the production of a vaccine. After testing the vaccine on monkeys, Enders, along with his coworkers Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, tried it on a group of 20 children at the Harvard Medical School Hospital in 1953. The results were dramatic: all of the children developed antibodies to the poliovirus, and none developed any symptoms of the disease. The team's results were published in the medical journal Science in 1953, and a patent for the vaccine was issued to Robbins in 1961. The three scientists were awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery. The Mahoney strain of the poliovirus, which was used to make the first vaccine, is still used today. The vaccine is made by killing the virus with formalin so that it is no longer infectious, but the dead virus still induces an immune response and the production of antibodies.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Winter's Tale (novel)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Winter's Tale is a 1983 magic realism novel by Mark Helprin. It takes place in a mythic New York City, markedly different from reality, and in an industrial  Edwardian era near the turn of the 20th century. The novel was adapted into a 2014 feature film by Akiva Goldsman.\n\nCharacters\n\nPeter Lake\nPeter Lake is the central character of Winter's Tale. An immigrant couple who were denied admission at Ellis Island due to consumption are forced to return to the ship City of Justice which had brought them. They break the display case containing a model of their ocean-going vessel and set their son Peter adrift in New York Harbor inside it. He is found in the reeds and adopted by the Baymen of the Bayonne Marsh, who send him off to Manhattan when he comes of age. There he first becomes a mechanic and then is forced to become a burglar in a gang called the Short Tails. He soon makes a mortal enemy of their leader, Pearly Soames, and is constantly on the run from the gang. Early one winter morning, Peter is on the brink of being captured and killed by the gang when he is rescued by a mysterious white horse, who becomes his guardian.\n\nWhile attempting to rob a house, Peter Lake meets and falls in love with Beverly Penn. The daughter of millionaire Isaac Penn, owner and publisher of The Sun, one of New York's greatest newspapers, Beverly is eccentric, free-spirited, and enigmatic. This captivates Peter initially, but her deeper nature is revealed with her terminal consumption. Beverly never disappears from Peter's life, protecting him until the very end. His love for the dying Beverly causes him to become obsessed with justice.\n\nIn yet another escape from Pearly's men, both Peter Lake and the white horse crash into a mysterious recurring cloud wall, disappearing in it for decades. When Peter Lake emerges, he no longer remembers who he is and is visibly no longer of this world, seeing and hearing things that nobody else can see or hear. One night, in a dream or a vision, he is carried on a tour of all the graves of the world, observing and remembering all the dead. In the apocalyptic chaos of burning New York, he acquires astonishing powers.\n\nPeter Lake refers to himself, earlier in his life, as \"Grand Central Pete\". In reality, there was a well-known confidence man in the late 19th century known by this name.\n\nAthansor\nAthansor, the white horse, acts as a guardian angel of Peter Lake. Able to fly and possessing extraordinary endurance, the white horse appears to be an angelic being. Before the end, Peter Lake releases him to finally let him go to heaven, as Athansor had not been able to do before because of Peter Lake.\n\nThe white horse appears on the first pages of the book, saving Peter Lake who is being pursued by the Short Tails. The name of the horse is unknown to Peter Lake, but when Peter Lake visits Bayonne Marsh, the Baymen recognise the horse as Athansor, part of their oral lore. The Baymen arrive from everywhere to view the horse, but never explain what they know about him besides the name and the fact that he comes from the left.\n\nAthansor is separated from Peter Lake when they both crash into the cloud wall but gets reunited with him towards the end of the story. Peter Lake releases him, and Athansor heads towards the heavenly pastures. As he gallops across Manhattan, trying to lift off, the whole island shakes under his hoofbeats.\n\nBeverly Penn\nBeverly Penn is a young woman dying from consumption who meets Peter Lake when he breaks into her house. Beverly is a visionary who can feel the universe. She writes down equations that explain the universe and mean for her that the universe shouts and growls. Beverly's father, newspaper publisher Isaac Penn, says about her that she had seen the Golden Age.\n\nEven after her death, Beverly protects Peter Lake. Pearly Soames says that he tried but could not get to Peter Lake through Beverly's protection.\n\nJackson Mead\nA master bridge builder and an enigmatic figure, Jackson Mead constructed many fine bridges all around the country. He is a brilliant engineer and appears to have unlimited material resources for the job. He is eventually revealed to be an exile from heaven, whose purpose is to build one last bridge that will bring forth the end of the world as it is, letting him return to heaven. As Jackson Mead puts it, his purpose is \"to tag this world with wider and wider rainbows, until the last is so perfect and eternal that it will catch the eye of the One who has abandoned us, and bring Him to right all the broken symmetries and make life once again a still and timeless dream. My purpose, Mr. Marratta, is to stop time, to bring back the dead. My purpose, in one word, is justice.\" Jackson Mead's rainbow bridge does not take, but he is not upset by the failure and disappears to bide time until his next attempt.\n\nIt is interesting that Jackson Mead's stated goal \"to stop time and bring back the dead\", in precisely these words, is widely associated with Peter Lake and in particular attributed to him on the back of the paperback edition.\n\nJackson Mead's character is partially based on Joseph Strauss, the engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hardesty Marratta recognizes Jackson Mead's face in the face of the monument to Joseph Strauss at the Golden Gate. The inscription on the monument refers to the bridge as the \"eternal rainbow\", a simile used by Jackson Mead.\n\nHowever, despite being a main character in the novel, he does not make an appearance in the movie.\n\nResidents of Lake of the Coheeries\nLake of the Coheeries is a semi-mythical lake and village, playing the role of Faerie, Elfland, or Alfheim.  Lake of the Coheeries is fictional, supposedly located in upstate New York across a mountain range from the Hudson River Valley.  Virginia Gamely is a resident there, living with her mother, Mrs. Gamely.  Both women ultimately play roles in New York City at the end of the tale.  Virginia's daughter is resurrected by Peter Lake.\n\nLiterary significance and reception\nWinter's Tale was published in 1983.  It was praised on the front cover of the New York Times Book Review (NYTBR) as \"funny, thoughtful, passionate...large-souled.\" \nReviewing the novel in Interzone magazine, Mary Gentle described Winter's Tale as\n\"a faerie family saga\" and \"the first specifically capitalist fantasy\".\nDavid Pringle, in the book Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels, praised Winter's Tale as \"a haunting piece of North American\nmagic realism\".\nIn May 2006, the New York Times Book Review published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to \"a short letter [from the review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to identify 'the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.'\" Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin's Winter's Tale.\n\nFilm adaptation\nThe film adaptation was released on Valentine's Day, 2014 and starred Colin Farrell as Peter Lake, Russell Crowe as Pearly Soames, Jessica Brown Findlay as Beverly Penn, Jennifer Connelly as Virginia Gamely, and Will Smith as Lucifer though originally credited as \"Judge\".\n\nThe movie began filming in New York in October 2012  with a slight delay due to Hurricane Sandy. Shooting on the film ran through early 2013 and operated on a $60 million budget, down from the original $75 million budget. It is unknown when Helprin sold the movie rights, with one report of Martin Scorsese originally purchasing the rights.\n\nAkiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay adaptation for the movie and is also making this his directing debut. Warner Bros. Pictures approved the picture in February 2011. The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel; composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score.\n\nCharacters not appearing in the film include Jackson Mead, Virginia's son Martin, and both Vittorio and Hardesty Marratta.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1983 American novels\n1983 fantasy novels\nAmerican alternate history novels\nNovels by Mark Helprin\nAmerican magic realism novels\nNovels set in New York City\nAmerican fantasy novels adapted into films\nWeidenfeld & Nicolson books", "machine_text": " Winter's Tale (novel) Winter's Tale is a novel by Mark Helprin, published in 1983 by Jonathan Cape, London. The novel was a literary success, receiving positive reviews and becoming a best seller in the United States. Winter's Tale is set in New York City, mainly in the years between 1960 and 1990. It tells the story of a half-wild \"foundling\" boy, Peter Lake, who is taken in by a poor family in the South Bronx. The family is squatting in an abandoned apartment of a large, empty building, and Peter is told that he is the son of the building's owner. When the building is sold, Peter is forced to live with his wealthy relatives, the Colemans, in their apartment on Park Avenue. As an adult, Peter becomes a successful Wall Street lawyer. He falls in love with a beautiful young woman, Beverly, who is engaged to his brother, William. When William is killed in a plane crash, Peter marries Beverly and they have a son, Charlie. Later, Beverly dies of cancer and Peter becomes a \"winter's tale\", a fatherless man with no purpose in life. Peter is approached by a mysterious man, Mr. Setterland, who claims to have known his late mother. Setterland asks Peter to perform a dangerous task: to fly to Moscow and extract a document from the Soviet Union's \"Topolov\" files. Peter refuses, but later learns that Setterland may have been his father. He then reconsiders, and travels to Moscow using a fake passport. In Moscow, Peter meets a beautiful Russian woman, Yevgeny, who is also a \"winter's tale\". They fall in love and she tells him about the Russian winter, which is a time of death but also a time of rebirth. Yevgeny helps Peter to translate the Topolov file, which contains the recipe for a deadly nerve agent. When Peter returns to New York, he is arrested by the FBI for violating the passport act. To prove that he is not a spy, Peter shows the FBI the Topolov file, which contains the recipe for the nerve agent. The FBI is unable to translate the file, and Peter is released. Peter decides to destroy the Topolov file, but he is attacked by two men who try to take it from him. He kills one, and the other escapes. Peter then burns the file and throws the ashes into the river. Later, Peter is visited by Setterland, who tells him that he is indeed Peter's father. Setterland explains that Peter's mother was a Russian who defected to the United States during World War II. She was a \"winter's tale\" like Yevgeny, and Setterland fell in love with her. However, she was killed in a car accident in 1960, the same year that Peter was born. Setterland tells Peter that the Topolov file was not a Soviet secret, but a Russian fairy tale. The \"recipe\" was actually a description of a magical potion that could bring the dead back to life. The file was given to Setterland by Peter's mother, and he has been trying to understand it ever since her death. Setterland says that he is ready to die and wants Peter to promise to live, so that he can see the world through Peter's eyes. Peter promises, and Setterland dies. Peter realizes that Setterland was indeed his father, and that he has inherited the \"winter's tale\" from his mother. Winter's Tale is a novel about fathers and sons, love and loss, and the power of storytelling. It is a fable about the importance of living, and about the possibility of redemption and rebirth.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1896579}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Mass Effect characters\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mass Effect series, a military science fiction media franchise developed by Canadian video game developer BioWare and owned by American publisher Electronic Arts, features an extensive cast of characters. It is primarily based on a series of third-person role-playing shooter video games which currently consists of four mainline instalments and two spin-off mobile games. The first three Mass Effect games takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy during the 22nd century and revolves around a space navy soldier named Commander Shepard. The fourth Mass Effect game is a standalone sequel to the original trilogy but set in a different galaxy, Andromeda, and focuses on the Andromeda Initiative and the Ryder family. The spin-off games, Mass Effect Galaxy and Mass Effect Infiltrator, feature different protagonists.\n\nThis article describes characters who appear in video games set in the  Mass Effect universe, which includes a diverse cast of alien, human and synthetic characters. This list describes only player characters, squad members, major antagonists, and other notable characters that appear in the games. Certain characters have names chosen by the player; these characters are designated the name they are addressed by in-game. The appearance and story arcs of certain characters in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 are conditional upon decisions from prior Mass Effect titles being carried over via an imported save file.\n\nPlayer characters\n\nCommander Shepard \n\nCommander Shepard is the central protagonist of the original Mass Effect trilogy of video games. On an assignment to investigate a besieged human colony, Shepard is affected by a Prothean artifact that grants them insight on the Reapers, making them the key entity to help protect the species of the Milky Way from being wiped out by the Reapers. Shepard is later named the first human Spectre by the Citadel Council, and given command of the SSV Normandy and its crew to complete their mission.\n\nThe character's given name, gender, background, and appearance are determined by the player on starting a new game, with both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 allowing the player to import saves from previous games to carry over that version of Shepard. Depending on the choice of gender, Shepard is voiced by either Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale. The default male version's face and body is based on the likeness of fashion model Mark Vanderloo.\n\nJeff \"Joker\" Moreau \n\nJeff Moreau, better known by his nickname \"Joker\", is the pilot of the Normandy. Joker is a skilled pilot who has osteogenesis imperfecta. His nickname alludes to his tendency to behave as a sarcastic foil to other individuals he interact with. In Mass Effect 2, Joker briefly becomes a playable character when the Collectors invade the Normandy to capture its crew in the absence of Shepard and the squad. He can develop a romantic relationship with EDI in Mass Effect 3 if encouraged.\n\nJoker is voiced by Seth Green.\n\nJacob Taylor\nJacob Taylor is the protagonist of Mass Effect Galaxy, a tie-in iOS game to Mass Effect 2. He is a former Systems Alliance soldier who is recruited by Miranda Lawson in Galaxy to investigate a conspiracy involving batarian terrorists. Jacob is encountered in Mass Effect 2 as an official member of Cerberus and Shepard's starting squad member, as well as a potential romantic option for a female Shepard. Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Jacob does not survive the suicide mission, in Mass Effect 3 he returns as a supporting character who has defected from Cerberus, and attempts to protect other Cerberus defectors from reprisals by their former employer.\n\nThe iconic look of all Cerberus clothing in the series is derived from the designs for Jacob's armor and clothing; some involved fully armored looks, while others had only cloth, or a mix of cloth and armor. For airless or toxic environments, Jacob wears a small breather device, which allows for more facial expressivity. According to a former BioWare employee, Jacob was originally meant to be a bisexual romance option, and that animation work for romance scenes with Commander Shepard of both genders, \"matching shot-for-shot from Brokeback Mountain\", was completed prior to intervention from management requesting that the same sex romantic content be removed, blaming backlash from news outlets like Fox News in response to the previous game.\n\nJacob Taylor is voiced by Adam Lazarre-White.\n\nChris Thursten from PC Gamer called Jacob \"the worst companion\" and the culmination of his romance arc \"the worst moment in Mass Effect\".\n\nRandall Ezno\nRandall Ezno is the protagonist of Mass Effect Infiltrator, a third-person shooter tie-in video game to Mass Effect 3 developed for mobile devices. He is a cybernetically modified Cerberus operative who discovers that his employer is up to something nefarious, goes rogue and embarks on a mission to save his friend from Cerberus.\n\nRandall is voiced by Jay Anthony Franke.\n\nPathfinder Ryder\nPathfinder Ryder is the main protagonist of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth mainline installment of the Mass Effect series, and the child of Alec Ryder. Their twin sibling is Sara or Scott Ryder, depending on the player's chosen gender. The player can change their character's first name, but if the default names of Sara or Scott are kept, NPCs will occasionally refer to the character's first name in voiced dialogue.\n\nThe Ryder siblings are cryogenically frozen and dispatched alongside their father and tens of thousands of other colonists on a 600-year journey to the Andromeda galaxy, departing before the events of Mass Effect 3. The ark carrying the humans, the Hyperion, arrives at the wrong drop point, far from the forward command centre of the Andromeda Initiative, the Nexus, and cut off from contact with both it and the other arks. The player-controlled Ryder later succeeds their father as the Hyperion's Pathfinder, and is tasked with leading their crew on the command ship The Tempest, successfully settling the Heleus Cluster, and improving life aboard the Nexus, a galactic hub for the colonizer races from the Milky Way.\n\nScott and Sara Ryder are voiced by Tom Taylorson and Fryda Wolff, respectively.\n\nAndromeda was known for its technical issues, particularly for the awkward facial animations of some of its characters; notably, the default face for Sara Ryder received negative reception from fans prior to  and after the game's launch, attracting comments such as \"It's a perfect representation of the uncanny valley\" and a \"robot-like model that had dead eyes syndrome\" prior to a patch fix released in early April 2017.\n\nSquad members\n\nOriginal trilogy\n\nKaidan Alenko \n\nKaidan Alenko is a human Alliance Navy officer with biotic powers, who serves aboard the SSV Normandy as Staff Lieutenant and head of the ship's Marine detail. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley Williams or Kaidan; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Kaidan survives, he returns in a cameo in Mass Effect 2 and as a full squad member in 3, where he has been promoted to the rank of Major and commands the 1st Special Operations Biotic Company, a covert operations unit. He is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. He is a potential romance option for a female Shepard throughout the entire trilogy, and for a male Shepard only in Mass Effect 3.\n\nKaidan is voiced by Raphael Sbarge.\n\nAshley Williams \n\nAshley Williams is a human Alliance Marine, who becomes part of Shepard's squad during the first observed Reaper attack in the first Mass Effect. In a late-game choice on the planet Virmire, the player must choose whether to save Ashley or Kaidan Alenko; this choice leads to the other character's death. If Ashley is saved, she will return in a cameo appearance in Mass Effect 2 and as a member of Shepard's squad for Mass Effect 3, where she has attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander and commands an unspecified covert operations unit. She is later bestowed Spectre status by the council. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard throughout the original trilogy.\n\nAshley Williams is voiced by Kimberly Brooks.\n\nGarrus Vakarian \n\nGarrus Vakarian is a male turian who serves as a squad mate in all three of the games. Garrus is initially a C-Sec officer who joins up with Shepard to escape from all the \"red tape\" in his job but becomes a vigilante under the alias Archangel on Omega in Mass Effect 2 before his squad is killed. Garrus is a potential romance option for a female Shepard in 2.  In Mass Effect 3, he leads a \"Reaper task force\" for the Turians, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if he was Shepard's paramour. The character is also the star of the third issue of Mass Effect: Homeworlds. Garrus's blue-and-black armour colour scheme was kept consistent throughout the series, as was his visor, although grey was added in the third game to reflect his new rank.\n\nGarrus is voiced by Brandon Keener.\n\nUrdnot Wrex \n\nA famous bounty hunter and mercenary, Wrex is among the last of the Krogan Battle Masters. They are rare individuals who can combine biotic abilities with advanced weaponry and tactics. He joins the crew of the SSV Normandy in the first Mass Effect to hunt the rogue Spectre Saren, but is later drawn into a stand-off with Commander Shepard in Virmire when he discovers that Saren's scientists have uncovered a cure for the genophage. Depending on the outcome, he may return in later sequels and eventually become a leader of the krogan.\n\nWrex is voiced by Steven Barr.\n\nTali'Zorah \n\nTali'Zorah, initially known by her full name Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, is the first quarian character to appear in the series. She is a squad mate in each of the three games. While she is known as a genius in the field of mechanical engineering. as the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah there is much pressure for Tali to excel. In the first game, she is on her Pilgrimage, before handing Shepard incriminating evidence about Saren and joining their crew. In the second game, now Tali'Zorah Vas Neema, where she joins Shepard on a suicide mission to rescue human colonists from the Collectors, and she is a potential romance option for a male Shepard. If she survives the suicide mission, she will appear as a squad member in Mass Effect 3, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour. If Shepard sides with the geth over the quarians during the latter's attempt to retake Rannoch, she will commit suicide after witnessing the annihilation of the quarian Migrant Fleet.\n\nTali is voiced by Ash Sroka, also credited as \"Liz Sroka\".\n\nLiara T'Soni \n\nLiara T'Soni is an asari scientist, that joins Shepard's squad in the first game and appears in 2 as a non-player character (available as a temporary squad member in Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker) and as a full squad member in 3. She is one of the experts on Prothean history and technology. Liara is a potential romance option for Shepard throughout the entire trilogy. Following Shepard's death in Mass Effect 2, Liara gradually became emotionally hardened, and began working as an information broker, eventually leading to the events of Lair of the Shadow Broker which conclude with her becoming the new Shadow Broker.\n\nLiara is voiced by Ali Hillis.\n\nMiranda Lawson \n\nMiranda Lawson is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in Mass Effect Galaxy and then serving as a squad mate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series and in Mass Effect 3 (provided the player does not import a save where she dies). She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father to be perfect and ran away from home to join Cerberus. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy SR-2, she is Shepard's second-in-command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man.\n\nMiranda Lawson is voiced by and modeled after actress Yvonne Strahovski.\n\nEDI\n\nEDI is an AI entity who first appears in Mass Effect 2 as the Normandy SR-2's artificial intelligence and speaks with an aurally feminine voice. Her name stands for \"Enhanced Defense Intelligence\", and is visually represented on the Normandy by a holographic blue sphere. For Mass Effect 3, the developers wanted to give EDI a body that is \"sexy, chrome, and robotic\", akin to the Maria character, also known as the Maschinenmensch, from Metropolis. EDI's facial and body design went through multiple iterations, which includes an eyeless visage, and partially completed 3-D models which differ from the EDI's appearance in terms of body shape, the split between solid and transparent surfaces, and finer points of her two-tone appearance. After some discussion about how robotic would the extent of her appearance be, the team decided that the body she would come to possess is an infiltration unit, which once had skin over its metal frame and is capable of the same facial effects as a living human being to avoid being easily spotted.\n\nMass Effect 2 establishes that EDI's highly advanced nature is a result of modifications achieved with technology salvaged from the Reaper Sovereign. She is initially \"shackled\" with programming which inhibits her decision making, until it was later removed by Joker. In Mass Effect 3, Shepard's team recovers a Cerberus infiltration unit named Eva to be analyzed after an incident at the Mars research station. EDI assists in doing so, and in the process, struggles with the synthetic entity and eventually seizes control of its platform in the process, allowing her to accompany Shepard as a squad mate on missions. Now possessing a physical body with humanlike characteristics, her relationship with Joker develops further, and, if Shepard supports the idea, the two may start a romantic relationship. She often asks Shepard about the context and nature of human behaviour so that she can better understand human psychology and, in a sense, taking on more human traits herself. During the Alliance raid on Cerberus Headquarters, a Cerberus report discovered in the base retroactively establishes EDI's original identity as a rogue VI which somehow achieved sentience and took over an Alliance training ground located on Earth's moon during an optional mission of the first Mass Effect game. If Shepard chooses to control the Reapers or the synthesis of all organic and synthetic life at the conclusion of the game, EDI will be present in the ending cutscene alongside Joker.\n\nEDI is voiced by Tricia Helfer.\n\nPC Gamer praised EDI's characterization, noting that she \"might have had some fine dialogue and ruminations on what it means to be human\". EDI is also included in PC Gamer's definitive list of the best squad mates around, citing her utility as a solid fighter and being an actual spaceship. GameRevolution included EDI in their list of \"Women Who Rock Modern Gaming\"; praise was focused on her unique contribution to the squad dynamic in Mass Effect 3 with her new body, her inexperience in interacting with humanity which often leads to humorous situations, as well as her integration into the game's main plot during the final act of the game. On the other hand, Wes Fenlon indicated in his articles written for PC Gamer and Gamesradar that he was disturbed by BioWare's decision to give EDI a sexy robot body, and involving the character in a romance subplot with Joker. Stacey Henley from TheGamer also disapproved of EDI's costume design in Mass Effect 3, and criticized the sexualization of the character's physical appearance as not only unnecessary, but also uncomfortable as it detracts from her role in Mass Effect 3s team dynamic, as well as her \"brilliant\" characterization which Henley summarized as \"engaging, philosophical, layered\".\n\nMordin Solus \n\nMordin Solus is a salarian scientist who possesses a hyperactive and eccentric personality, a rapid and stilted manner of speaking, and  a flawless autobiographical and eidetic memory which is a typical salarians trait. He is a key member in the science team that researched the remodification of the Krogan Genophage, an action that he initially considered the best possible solution to a once growing problem, as he believes in acting in the best interests of the galaxy.\n\nThe character returns in Mass Effect 3, providing he survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2; otherwise, another salarian scientist named Padok Wiks fulfills Mordin's role within the narrative. Mordin is encountered on the salarian homeworld, Sur'Kesh, when Shepard is sent there to aid in the evacuation of a fertile female krogan codenamed Eve, the only survivor of his student Maelon's experiments. If Maelon's research data was saved in the previous game, he uses it to aid in Eve's treatment and produce a viable cure for the Genophage.\n\nMordin Solus is voiced by Michael Beattie in Mass Effect 2, and by William Salyers in Mass Effect 3.\n\nJack \n\nJack, also known as Jacqueline Nought or \"Subject Zero\", is the powerful product of unethical Cerberus experiments to enhance human biotic ability, which molded her antisocial temperament. Shepard may recruit Jack from the prison facility that she is confined in to join the suicide mission against the Collectors, in exchange for files aboard the Normandy about the science facility where Cerberus scientists tortured and abused her. She is a potential romance option for a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2. Jack reappears in Mass Effect 3 if a save game is imported where she survives the events of the suicide mission, with the option to continue their relationship from 2 if she was Shepard's paramour.\n\nJack is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.\n\nGrunt\nGrunt is a tank-bred genetically engineered super-krogan that can be recruited as a squad member. Grunt's design is intended to be youthful but also tough, invoking the look of a linebacker with large shoulder pads and exposed muscular arms. Compared to Wrex who is a much older krogan, Grunt's crest is smaller and does not fully cover his entire skull due to his age. Early designs for Grunt's armor varied widely, which eventually settled into a polished and sleek look, almost like a \"show-room finish\" on a brand new car. A confrontation scene in Mass Effect 2 between Grunt and Mordin over the latter's role in strengthening the Genophage was planned but ultimately cut during development.\n\nInitially in Mass Effect 2, Shepard is meant to recruit Okeer, a krogan warlord and radical scientist who has been developing a small army of krogan to weather the Genophage. When Shepard arrives to recruit him, Okeer is working for the Blue Suns mercenary group, but was betrayed by the latter. Though Shepard and crew defeat the Blue Suns leader, it is too late to save Okeer, who leaves Shepard with a tank containing his \"legacy\", his \"perfect krogan\". If and when Shepard decides to awaken him, the krogan recalls Okeer's last words and chooses one of them, \"grunt\", as his name. While initially hostile towards Shepard, Grunt may be recruited as a squad mate. He comes to respect Shepard's leadership, partly because Shepard faces great battles and has powerful enemies. If Grunt becomes loyal, he declares Shepard his battlemaster. If the player imports a save game where Grunt survives the suicide mission in 2, he appears in Mass Effect 3 in a small role.\n\nGrunt is voiced by Steve Blum.\n\nGrunt showing Shepard his strength in Mass Effect 2 is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.PC Gamer staff noted that while there is not much to the character \"beyond punching things and talking about fighting\", dealing with Grunt could be a \"refreshing change from the philosophizing and soul-searching of the rest of the crew.\"\n\nThane Krios\n\nThane is a mysterious drell assassin who is terminally ill from a disease known as Kepral's Syndrome, which is exclusive to drell due to their physiology. While a coldblooded killer, Thane possesses a conscience that struggles against his own profession. Shepard may recruit him on the asari-dominated world of Ilium for the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. At the time of his recruitment, Thane states he has nothing left to lose, and he hopes to right many wrongs he has found in the galaxy before his death. Thane Krios is a possible romantic interest for a female Shepard.\n\nThane returns in Mass Effect 3 provided he survived the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. Thane may play a role in the narrative depending on the player's prior decisions, but will ultimately succumb to his wounds from Kai Leng if he plays a role in preventing the assassination of a Citadel councilor, or to Kepral's Syndrome.\n\nThane Krios is voiced by Keythe Farley.\n\nSamara\n\nSamara is an Asari Justicar, a member of a highly respected and feared ascetic order of mystic warriors. Samara is on a quest to track down her fugitive daughter Morinth, who is a biological deviant known as an Ardat-Yakshi. Shepard meets Samara on Illium, where she is found investigating the Eclipse mercenary group who smuggled her daughter off-world. Samara will join Shepard for the suicide mission at the conclusion of the investigation; if Shepard chooses to participate in her quest, a decision has to be made between siding with Samara or Morinth at the climax of the story arc. If the player imports a save game where Samara survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she returns in a small role in Mass Effect 3 where she is encountered by Shepard at an Ardat-Yakshi monastery; confronted by a duty to comply with the Justicar Code by executing her only living child, who is also Ardat-Yakshi like Morinth and forbidden from leaving an asari monastery, she will attempt to commit suicide unless Shepard stops her.\n\nSamara is voiced by Maggie Baird, while Rana McAnear provides her likeness.\n\nMorinth\nMorinth is the fugitive daughter of Samara. She is an Ardat-Yakshi, asari who are born with an inherited trait which kills their mates during sexual encounters by burning out their nervous systems. Morinth joins Shepard's squad in Mass Effect 2 if she is assisted with trapping and killing Samara. She will then disguise herself as her mother and takes up residence at Samara's quarters on board The Normandy, so that only Shepard knows of Samara's death. Shepard may choose to mate with Morinth, although it will result in his or her death. If the player imports a save game where Morinth is recruited and survives the events of Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3 as an indoctrinated husk-like enemy type known as a banshee.\n\nMorinth is voiced by Natalia Cigliuti. Her face was modeled after Rana McAnear. Morinth originally had a different face and character model and could not pass as Samara, and that Shepard would have had to either disclose the truth about Samara's fate to the rest of the crew or lie to them. Unlike most other squadmates in Mass Effect who had more complete arcs, Morinth only has two full-fledged conversations with Shepard, which mainly deals with her backstory with Samara and her experiences growing up as an Ardat-Yakshi. Morinth's planned dialogue options were trimmed down due to scope reasons and time constraints encountered during development, and the team opted to give the character an appearance which is identical to Samara, instead of cutting her from the game completely.\n\nVideo game developer Brian Kindregan, who wrote Morinth for Mass Effect 2, described her as a free spirit, a character who decides her own destiny and flaunt society's rules even if others are harmed in the process. To explore the dark underside of sapient or sentient beings that Morinth is drawn to, the decision was made to shift her original role from the leader of an underground cult to a hedonistic sexual predator who prowls for victims at a nightclub on Omega space station. Inspired by nightclub scenes depicted in Blade and The Matrix, Kindregan wanted to convey the feeling of an \"alternative culture just underneath the surface of one, and one that represents hedonism but also a slightly scary, predatory feel.\" Kindregan emphasized that the mission was not intended to be social commentary on drugs and nightclubs, but rather the underlying concepts they represent in fiction, as nightclubs in his view represent \"unbridled human impulse and desire\" and material excess by privileged youth similar in spirit to the symbolism presented by the depiction of jungles and wild nature in Heart of Darkness.\"\n\nUnlike most other levels in Mass Effect 2, Morinth's nightclub scene does not involve any combat sequences; instead, it entirely revolves around a story-driven gameplay mechanic Kindregan called a \"puzzle conversation\". Kindregan said it is difficult to write and implement a puzzle conversation as the player is supposed to be able to intuit the correct answers by interpreting Morinth's facial expressions and body language, and that he had considered incorporating a \"safety valve\" at the beginning of the mission for the benefit for the player, which would have served as a foolproof way to acquire all the correct answers to the conversation and complete the mission. Kindregan credited the positive feedback for the mission to the success of the final product's narrative and design as well as his teamwork with senior level senior level designer Dusty Evermore.\n\nPC Gamer staff considers Morinth to be a poor replacement for her mother, \"the more interesting and conflicted justicar\". She is rated better as an antagonist instead, the \"cat-and-mouse game of catching Morinth\" being lauded as one of Mass Effect 2's most exciting moments. András Neltz from Kotaku commented that \"the sheer audacity of a scam this huge—setting out to recruit a virtuous Asari Justicar, and coming back with her black widow of a daughter instead, passing her off as the real thing—is truly amazing.\"\n\nLegion \n\nLegion is the name, inspired by the \"Gospel of Mark 5:9 – Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\", given to the gestalt intelligence hosted within a geth mobile unit eleven times more powerful than standard geth mobile platforms. Legion belongs to the true Geth Consensus, and is designed to operate outside of geth space and interact diplomatically with organic lifeforms. In contrast to other Geth, Legion is capable of independent thought, and demonstrates emotional attachment as they are particularly fascinated with Shepard.\n\nLegion is voiced by D. C. Douglas.\n\nZaeed Massani \nZaeed is a human bounty hunter who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack Zaeed - The Price of Revenge and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. He holds the reputation as the galaxy's most feared bounty hunter and co-founder of the Blue Suns mercenary group. Unlike most other characters, Zaeed joins Shepard's squad as soon as he is spoken to, and only tells short stories when conversed with. For his loyalty mission, he asks that Shepard help his vendetta against the Blue Suns' other co-founder, Vido Santiago. If the player imports a save game where Zaeed survives the events of 2, Zaeed returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role.\n\nOriginally cut from the base game due to budget and time constraints, the Zaeed - The Price of Revenge DLC allowed the character's writer Jay Turner to repurpose unused content and use the constraints as a core part of his character. As Zaeed's loyalty mission is the only opportunity for players to get to know him, Turner had to ensure that all aspects of the character, \"from his dialogue to the identity of the villain to the events along the way\" must speak to his personality and backstory. To establish a simple but compelling motive for him, Turner pitched Zaeed's loyalty mission as one based on revenge, with his personality shaped into that of a grizzled survivor who has endured all kinds of death-defying situations with the stories and scars to prove it. Turner intended Zaeed to be an exploration of the themes of PTSD and trauma, and also as a ruthless antithesis to the \"BioWare Paladin\" archetype who is willing to complete his mission at all costs. Zaeed initially had a mechanic leg and a dog companion during early concept stages. Head models for the character went through various iterations, which included scarring, tattoos with the Blue Suns insignia, and potential breathers inspired by hocket masks and welding helmets for intimidation purposes.\n\nZaeed is voiced by Robin Sachs.\n\nPC Gamer staff member Wes Fenlon calling Zaeed a \"less interesting retread of KotOR's Mandalorian Canderous Ordo\" and expressed doubt about his ineffectiveness as a squad mate.\n\nKasumi Goto \n\nKasumi is a human master thief who is integrated into Mass Effect 2 through the DLC pack, Kasumi – Stolen Memory and later as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition compilation. The character's core concept is “the best thief in the galaxy”. Unlike other characters, Kasumi does not have a recruitment mission and joins Shepard's squad as soon as she is spoken to, only making brief remarks or observations when interacted with. For her loyalty mission, Kasumi requests Shepard's help in retrieving the memory box of her dead lover Keiji Okuda. Kasumi returns in Mass Effect 3 with a small role, provided a save game is imported where her eponymous DLC was played and she survives the suicide mission.\n\nOriginally cut from the base game, Kasumi allowed the character's writer Jay Turner the chance to provide a \"glimpse into a wild underground where there are art heists and Bond villains and respect among thieves\" in Mass Effect 2. Turner wrote Kasumi's personality to be \"irreverent and quirky and confident\", with the intention to position her as Shepard's \"best friend\" as opposed to being yet another female character who Shepard could romance or sleep with. Describing Kasumi as his favorite character, Turner thought of her as a cheerful change from the game's often serious and severe tone. Kasumi presented Turner with an opportunity to explore the series' tropes from a different angle as she comments on Shepard's world from the perspective of an outsider who is a master of her world, one which is unfamiliar to Shepard. Turner compared her to the Batman character, in that she is always prepared and composed for any given situation, in spite of her flighty or flippant demeanor. Kasumi's visual design drew inspiration from Middle Eastern culture; her outfit echoes that of a typical thief from the European Middle Ages, the hood in particular gives her a mysterious and stealthy look.\n\nKasumi Goto is voiced by Kym Hoy. Hoy noted that Kasumi's cultural background is specifically stated to be of Japanese descent, and that the casting call required a candidate who could carry the mystique of an elusive personality along with projecting a vaguely Asian-sounding accent. With the guidance of her voiceover directors, Hoy made necessary preparations to develop a blend of Japanese and British English accents for Kasumi's soft-spoken voice; as she wanted a little mystery surrounding where Kasumi is truly from, she was mindful about not making the accent overly modern-sounding and not too precise. Hoy credits her past experience in performing ethnic Asian characters as well as her classical theatre and singing training for her ability to perform Kasumi's accent at a consistent pace, and ensuring the character sounds natural in terms of timing and delivery without it becoming a caricature. Hoy noted that while BioWare had specifications about how they wanted the character to sound like, with \"1940s movie star sass\" being an ideal, they were also open to feedback and questions from her about the development of the character's personality.\n\nPC Gamer staff praised Kasumi as one of more visually interesting Mass Effect squad mates. IGN's Steven Hopper ranked Kasumi #9 in his list of best Mass Effect teammates.\n\nJames Vega\n\nLieutenant James Vega is a human Systems Alliance Marine and Shepard's squad member in Mass Effect 3. James is tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, however the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth. James and Ashley or Kaidan, depending on who survived Virmire, retrieve the Normandy SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth. James is the main focus of the  anime film, Mass Effect: Paragon Lost.\n\nJames Vega is voiced by Freddie Prinze, Jr. in all media.\n\nJavik\nJavik is the endling of the Prothean race, and is only available if the Mass Effect 3: From Ashes DLC is installed. His stasis pod is uncovered and opened by Commander Shepard and Liara T'Soni during his recruitment mission, who were investigating Cerberus activity on the human colony of Eden Prime. Flashbacks of Javik's memories happen during the mission which reveals insights on the Prothean's struggle against the Reapers. Javik reacted with shock that he had awaken after 50,000 years and everything he knew was gone, but agrees to join Shepard to stop the Reapers no matter the cost.\n\nThe Protheans were first depicted in the form of visually ambiguous statues on the planet Ilos in the first game, as at the time BioWare was unsure as to the extent of the role the Protheans would play over the course of the original trilogy. Javik's final design is based on the look of the Collectors from Mass Effect 2, particularly the shell shape of the head which is a signature feature of the Collectors, along with multiple pupils to the eyes and secondary nostrils to evoke a very alien feel. As the Protheans of his time were known for their highly advanced technological capabilities, Javik is intended to look more intelligent than a mindless Collector drone. Javik's armor, which is influenced by the aesthetics of samurai armor, is intended to be technologically advanced yet with an ancient feel, thematically appropriate for a being who had been placed in stasis for over 50,000 years.\n\nJavik is voiced by Ike Amadi.\n\nMass Effect: Andromeda\n\nCora Harper\nCora Harper is a human biotic commando and operations specialist in charge of the Pathfinder team's ground missions. She began a career in the Alliance military, before serving with an asari commando unit as part of a Council inter-species integration scheme. She is second-in-command of the human Pathfinder team and meant to be Alec Ryder's appointed successor as Pathfinder. Cora is a romance option for a male Pathfinder.\n\nCora is voiced by Jules de Jongh.\n\nLiam Kosta\nLiam Kosta is a human security and crisis response specialist for the Pathfinder team, and was “hand-picked” by Alec Ryder due to his multidisciplinary skills. Liam is a romance option for a female Pathfinder.\n\nLiam is voiced by Gary Carr.\n\nVetra Nyx\nVetra Nyx is from the turian homeworld of Palaven and a well traveled drifter, who at some point \"drifted into the wrong crowd\". She has well honed street smarts and adaptability from years of working with smugglers and mercenaries, and is fiercely loyal once her trust is earned. Vetra is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.\n \nVetra is voiced by Danielle Rayne.\n\nPelessaria \"Peebee\" B'Sayle\nPelessaria B'Sayle, better known by her nickname Peebee is a rogue-ish young academic from Port Lerama, capital of the planet Hyetiana, a hub for asari science and education. She has developed an obsessive interest in studying the Remnant, an umbrella term coined for technology, structures, and autonomous bots that have been sighted across the Heleus Cluster. She is considered to be an atypical member of asari culture, “pathologically independent”, and has little regard for rules or teamwork. She is rivals with Kalinda, another asari who competes with Peebee in her search for Remnant technology. Peebee is a romance option for a Pathfinder of either gender.\n\nPeebee is voiced by Christine Lakin.\n\nNakmor Drack\nNakmor Drack is a veteran krogan warrior who has well over 1,400 years of life experience as a soldier, mercenary, and occasional pirate in the Milky Way galaxy. He is vocal about the genophage and the Citadel community's treatment of his species. Unlike other members of the Nakmor clan, he is loyal to the Nexus, the seat of government and power for the Andromeda Initiative, and to his granddaughter, Nakmor Kesh. Drack's preferred weapon is a \"Ruzad\" shotgun, and his favorite ability is Blood Rage, which \"enhances his melee damage, damage resistance, and health regeneration\".\n\nDrack is voiced by Stanley Townsend.\n\nJaal Ama Darav\nJaal Ama Darav is a high-ranking member of the Angaran Resistance who are at war with the kett, and joins the Pathfinder's team as a liaison between the Andromeda Initiative and the resistance fighters. Jaal's preferred weapon is a sniper rifle. Jaal was initially a romance option for a female player character only, and was an early fan favorite among Andromeda's new cast of characters. A patch  for the game released in June 2017 made Jaal available as a potential romance option for a male player character.\n\nJaal is voiced by Nyasha Hatendi.\n\nMajor antagonists\n\nThe Reapers\n\nThe Reapers are a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships residing in dark space: the vast, mostly starless space between galaxies. They hibernate and remain dormant for a cycle of fifty thousand years, before returning to the Milky Way galaxy and harvest all sentient organic life. The Reapers and their various agents are the overarching antagonists of the original trilogy.\n\nSaren Arterius\nSaren Arterius is a turian Spectre, an elite operative who represented the Citadel Council and operated above the law, and one of the two main antagonists of the first Mass Effect game . Saren was originally designed as an older, weaker character who is a powerful biotic. Saren's head design went through several iterations: the team experimented with structure, scarring, and decorations. His final appearance is similar to other turians but with a distinctive crest, and a lack of tattoos unlike most of his kind. It was intended for the character to show signs of severe indoctrination, yet does not look like an obvious monstrosity and is still able to blend into society. The character's final design incorporates a mechanical arm and some visible cybernetic features to reflect Reaper indoctrination.\n\nHe first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, which takes place 18 years before to the events of Mass Effect and before he was indoctrinated and working with Sovereign. Saren later takes command of a dissident geth faction through the use of a Reaper known as Sovereign. With a machine army at his command, he uses them to both do his bidding and oppose Shepard across the story of the Mass Effect video game. Saren's main base is situated on the planet Virmire, where he is conducting experiments such as a cure for the Krogan Genophage to bolster his army. Throughout the course of the game, the Reaper slowly began to manipulate Saren through subtle subliminal messages into helping it bring back the Reapers. During the geth invasion of the Citadel, Saren uses the Prothean Conduit to gain access to the Citadel to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel mass relay. The player can then either attempt to kill Saren or appeal to Saren to fight his indoctrination, which if successful will prompt him to commit suicide. Shepard later has to fight a revived and mutated Saren, who is possessed by Sovereign through his grafted cybernetics. Upon defeat of the Sovereign-manipulated Saren, Sovereign itself loses its defenses and is destroyed.\n\nIGN included the moment Saren commits suicide in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.\n\nSaren is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.\n\nMatriarch Benezia\nMatriarch Benezia is the mother of Liara T'Soni, and was a highly regarded spiritual leader among the asari until she was mind controlled by the Reaper Sovereign and forced to become Saren's second in command. Her appearance is intended to capture the beauty and mystical power of the asari, and also to associate her with Saren's malevolence through its darker and more enigmatic qualities. The design of her headdress references religious and royal clothing.\n\nIn Mass Effect Shepard travels to the planet Noveria and confronts Benezia, discovering that she has found and captured a surviving queen of the rachni. Benezia intends to use the rachni queen to breed an army of rachni to fight Saren's enemies. Although Benezia has a lucid moment during their fight, where she reveals the next phase of Saren's plans and warns Shepard about Sovereign's corrupting influence, Shepard has to fight her to the death after she completely succumbs to the indoctrination.\n\nMatriarch Benezia is voiced by Marina Sirtis.\n\nDonnel Udina\nDonnel Udina first appears in the original Mass Effect as the human ambassador based in the Citadel. Udina is depicted as self-serving politician who has an antagonistic relationship with Shepard and their mentor David Anderson throughout the original trilogy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he is the representative for humanity in the Citadel Council, regardless of the player's choice in the ending of the first game. Later in 3, Udina allies with Cerberus to stage a coup in a desperate attempt to overthrow his fellow Councillors as part of his plan to prioritize the liberation of planet Earth from the Reapers, but he is killed when the coup fails.\n\nDonnell Udina is voiced by Bill Ratner.\n\nThe Thorian\nThe Thorian, also called Species 37, is an ancient sentient fungal creature tens of thousands of years old, with unique mind-controlling and telepathic abilities, the ability to create clone duplicates of a being it has absorbed, and a massive sensory network stretching over the surface of the planet Feros. It releases spores into the air that infect those who inhale them, and uses pain to control the behavior of its thralls. In Mass Effect, the Thorian encounters Shiala, an asari and former acolyte of Matriarch Benezia who had been absorbed by the Thorian, which used clone duplicates of her as an avatar to interact with Shepard's team. Shiala will be set free after the Thorian is killed, and she grants Shepard the Prothean cipher which enables the mental decryption of the mental message transmitted from the Prothean beacon. Shepard has the choice to either spare or execute her.\n\nCerberus \n\nCerberus, an anthropocentric group advocating militarism and a \"humanity-first\" supremacist agenda, appears as recurring antagonists in the series. Cerberus is founded and led by the Illusive Man, voiced by Martin Sheen. Cerberus forms an alliance with Commander Shepard against the human-abducting Collectors in Mass Effect 2, whereas in Mass Effect 3 they work against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, as the Illusive Man wishes to control them instead. The organization experienced numerous defections between the events of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, including operatives who specialize in close combat electric whips.\n\nMegan Logan from Inverse praised the depiction of Cerberus in the series as a villainous entity, and opined that \"nuanced complexity built upon an understandable motivation is what makes a compelling antagonist\".\n\nKai Leng\nKai Leng is a former lieutenant N7 marine and Cerberus assassin, who first appears in the novel Mass Effect: Retribution, as well as its subsequent sequels. Kai Leng is the Illusive Man's most trusted agent, who used him as his best infiltration and wet-work operative for over a decade, and appears in Mass Effect 3 as one of the game's main antagonists. He wears a coat similar to Thane's over a uniform with Cerberus colors, and his face and body is equipped with visible cybernetic implants to compensate for the injuries he sustained in Retribution courtesy of David Anderson. Early direction of Kai Leng's concept involve inhuman-looking metallic legs and hard armor as upgrades, which were streamlined during the later period of the development cycle of 3 into a stealthier appearance along with his hairstyle, coat length and visor type.\n\nIn Mass Effect 3 he was among the forces deployed during Udina's coup on the Citadel Council, and will succeed in assassinating the salarian councilor unless Thane Krios or Kirrahe are available in Mass Effect 3 to intervene. Kai Leng is next encountered on the asari homeworld Thessia, where he successfully claims an ancient Prothean-made VI from the asari on the Illusive Man's orders. Shepard's final encounter with Kai Leng is in the Illusive Man's observation deck on Cronos Station, the Cerberus headquarters. Despite his lethal skills, he is unable to overwhelm Shepard, and is wounded. He later retrieves his blade and makes a final attempt to kill the Commander from behind. At that moment, Shepard detects him and counters his attack, finishing him off with an omni-blade.\n\nKai Leng is voiced by Troy Baker.\n\nKai Leng's execution by Shepard is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.\n\nOleg Petrovsky\nOleg Petrovsky is a general of Cerberus' armed forces, who first appears in the comic Mass Effect: Invasion, where he seizes control of the Omega space station from Aria T'Loak using adjutants, a type of husk-like creature engineered by Cerberus through co-opting Reaper technology. He makes his first video game appearance as the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega.\n\nThe Collectors\nThe Collectors are mysterious aliens first mentioned in the 2008 novel Mass Effect: Ascension, who are known to trade hyper-advanced technology in exchange for living beings from various species. They were widely dismissed as myths within the Mass Effect universe, but are in fact the deformed versions of the original Prothean race. Prior to the events of Mass Effect 2, all known expeditions to investigate the Collectors failed, and no vessel that ventured to their space beyond Omega 4 Relay ever returned save those of the Collectors themselves. Led by a Collector General, a unique being who controls the rest of the Collectors from their base beyond the Omega Four mass relay, they collect humans by incapacitating them using flying insect-like \"seeker swarms\" to create a new Reaper on their masters' behest following Sovereign's defeat and destruction at the end of the first game. The Collectors are assisted by a variety of husk units made from Reaper technology, with some created from multiple husks strung together in a grotesque manner such as Scions who provide ranged fire support with their arm cannons, as well as large floating monstrosities called Praetorians. The Collectors' look is based on crabs and microscopic closeups of insect species like beetles and mosquitoes. The Collectors were initially envisioned as robed walking bipedal aliens for a dark, cultlike feel; as Collector soldier units had to fulfill in-game combat mechanic requirements, their design shifted to a more humanoid appearance, while the Collector General has multiple limbs that resemble arthropod legs.\n\nAndrás Neltz from Kotaku consider the Collectors to be tragic figures, and \"a demonstration of what evil the Reapers are capable of; a twisted shadow of a once-proud race, forced to serve the ones who destroyed them.\"\n\nThe Shadow Broker\nThe Shadow Broker is the elusive and enigmatic head of an expansive organization which trades in data and information, always selling to the highest bidder. The Shadow Broker's identity is unknown to the general public and always operates through an agent. For the Shadow Broker's design, two disparate concepts were combined: that of the galaxy's greatest information broker whose suit evokes a mob boss look and is fully integrated into the galactic community, as well as that of an unfamiliar alien and a frighteningly inhuman challenge for Shepard. The Broker's final facial design, with his triangular mouth and multiple eyes, is unlike anything BioWare has done in the past, and custom work had to be done to animate his face properly as Mass Effect 2 digital-acting system could not handle the graphical stress.\n\nIn Mass Effect Tali wanted to trade evidence incriminating Saren to the Shadow Broker in exchange for a safe place to hide; the Broker sends a thug named Fist to deal with her, although he later dispatches Wrex to eliminate Fist, who had turned traitor. Other notable agents of the Broker include the volus financial adviser Barla Von, and Wilson, Miranda Lawson's assistant in the Lazarus Project who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate on Lazarus Station in Mass Effect 2. Following the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, Liara pursues the Shadow Broker for revenge over her friend Feron's imprisonment and torture. In Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker, Liara survives an assassination attempt by an agent of the Broker, a rogue asari Spectre named Tela Vasir. She then travels to the Shadow Broker Base on the planet Hagalaz with Shepard, where they confront the Shadow Broker, who is revealed to be a member of a pre-spaceflight race called the yahg. They killed the Broker following a boss fight, and Liara succeeds him as the new Shadow Broker.\n\nShepard's meeting and confrontation with the Shadow Broker is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas, and one of the 13 best Mass Effect Moments by IGN.\n\nDr. Amanda Kenson\nDr. Amanda Kenson is a human scientist known for her groundbreaking discoveries on the origins of the mass relays. She appears as a deep cover agent in the Mass Effect 2 DLC Arrival, and is saved from batarian captivity by Shepard on her friend Admiral Hackett's behest. She claims to have found evidence of an imminent Reaper invasion, revealing that her team have set a massive asteroid to collide into a mass relay located within the Bahak system in batarian space in order to slow the Reapers' arrival. After her entire team is revealed to have been indoctrinated by the Reapers, Shepard has to stop Dr. Kenson from interrupting the asteroid's course, which culminates in Dr. Kenson killing herself after detonating an explosive device. If the player imports a save where the Arrival DLC is completed, Shepard's action of facilitating the destruction of the Bahak system's mass relay in order to delay the Reapers' invasion resulted in the loss of over 300,000 batarian lives, which leads to their imprisonment and impending trial in the beginning of Mass Effect 3.\n\nMaya Brooks\nMaya Brooks is the alias of a former Cerberus operative who serves as the main antagonist of the story campaign of the Mass Effect 3 DLC Citadel; she initially presents herself to Shepard as a Systems Alliance staff analyst. She is also responsible for sabotaging Lazarus Station, which housed the Lazarus Project that brought Shepard back from the dead, in order to steal a dormant clone of Shepard. Her actions led to the sequence of events following Shepard's awakening from a coma in Mass Effect 2. She later appears in Mass Effect: Foundation, a 13-issue comic book series starring most of Shepard's squad mates in the original trilogy, which is framed as reconnaissance by Brooks as the point-of-view character.\n\nThe Kett\nThe kett are a hostile militaristic species with dense formations of bone growing externally as armor protrusions on their bodies. They serve as the main antagonists of Mass Effect Andromeda. The kett are led by the Archon, who is voiced by Robert Kazinsky.\n\nOther characters\n\nOriginal trilogy\n\nDavid Anderson\nCaptain David Edward Anderson is a protagonist of the novel Mass Effect: Revelation, an experienced N7 marine and Commander Shepard's mentor throughout the Mass Effect trilogy. He is also the love interest of Kahlee Sanders. In the first game he was relieved of command of the SSV Normandy by Donnel Udina, and the starship was transferred to Shepard's command. By the events of Mass Effect 3 he is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate early in the game during the early stages of the Reaper invasion. He appears dressed for battle in fatigues that would not reflect his rank but also wouldn't look out of place in a battlefield.\n\nAnderson is voiced by Keith David.\n\nIGN included the Finale in Mass Effect 3, where Shepard shares an emotional scene with Anderson and the Illusive man, in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.\n\nKahlee Sanders\nKahlee Sanders is a protagonist of Mass Effect: Revelation and its sequels, Ascension, Retribution, and Deception She is cited as one of the most important characters in the series, and the main heroine of Mass Effect spin-off fiction. She makes her first video game appearance in Mass Effect 3 as a staff member of the Grissom Academy.\n\nDr. Chakwas\nDr. Karin Chakwas is a recurring character in the Mass Effect series as the human doctor of the SSV Normandy, and later the Normandy SR-2. Dr. Chakwas survives the destruction of the SSV Normandy in Mass Effect 2, and later accepts Cerberus' offer to join Shepard in their fight against the Collectors, getting a position on the Normandy SR-2 as the ship's Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Chakwas returns in Mass Effect 3, provided she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2. She may be recruited back to the Normandy, or be convinced to stay at the Citadel and assist in the war effort.\n\nDr. Chakwas is voiced by Carolyn Seymour.\n\nRichard L. Jenkins\nCorporal Richard L. Jenkins is an Alliance Marine from the rural world of Eden Prime under the command of Captain Anderson, and a member of the SSV Normandy's crew. He joins Shepard as a squadmate during their incursion to his homeworld in Mass Effect, where he is killed shortly afterwards. He is based on the Leeroy Jenkins character.\n\nConrad Verner\nConrad Verner is a human fanatic who is obsessed with Commander Shepard. András Neltz from Kotaku notes that he is a \"crazy fan archetype taken to the next level\", and an example of a character whose personality and fate could be shaped by the player throughout the original trilogy depending on how their player character reacts to Verner's antics.\n\nKhalisah al-Jilani\nKhalisah bint sinan al-Jilani is a human reporter from Westerlund News. She appears in all three games as a reporter who employs a belligerent  line of questioning whenever she is granted an opportunity to interview Shepard. She also appears in Mass Effect Andromeda: Initiation, a prequel novel to Mass Effect: Andromeda.\n\nIGN included the running gag where Shepard can prematurely end their interview sessions with al-Jilani by punching her as a renegade action throughout the original trilogy in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments. Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo referred to the aforementioned running gag as the \"Al-Jilani Saga\" and one of her favorite moments.\n\nAdministrator Anoleis \nAdministrator Bel Anoleis manages Port Hanshan, the capital of the planet Noveria, in the first Mass Effect. In order to obtain a garage pass to leave the port, Shepard could either prove the salarian bureaucrat's corruption to an undercover investigator named Gianna Parasini, side with Anoleis and turn over all the evidence to him, or pit Anoleis and Parasini against each other which leads to both of their deaths. András Neltz from Kotaku noted that the mission dealing with Anoleis was one of the most complex ones in the first game, and it was an early example \"showing how differently the story can go depending on the player's decisions\".\n\nCaptain Kirrahe \nCaptain Kirrahe was the Salarian Special Tasks Group (STG) intelligence officer who uncovered Saren's facility on Virmire, and fights alongside Shepard's squad during the assault. Kirrahe's determination to destroy Saren's base, and thus the cure with it, causes a rift between Shepard and Wrex which may be resolved by the player in a number of ways. If he survives the battle, he will be promoted to Major and appears in Mass Effect 3 as an ally at various instances. Kirrahe's speech amidst a thunderstorm in Mass Effect is considered to be one of the original trilogy's most iconic moments by Kotaku's Gergo Vas.\n\nSteven Hackett\nAdmiral Steven Hackett is a high-ranking official of the Earth Systems Alliance Navy's Fifth Fleet. He first appears as a minor character in Mass Effect who commands the Systems Alliance reinforcements which arrive to assist in the defense during the attack on the Citadel by Sovereign and the geth. During the course of the battle, he will defer to Shepard's wishes to either save the Citadel Councillors aboard the asari dreadnought the Destiny Ascension, or press the attack on Sovereign's forces. After the battle, he is promoted to head of the Alliance Navy. By the events of Mass Effect 3, he leads the entire Alliance forces in their struggle against the Reaper invasion.\n\nHackett is voiced by Lance Henriksen.\n\nKelly Chambers\nKelly Chambers is Shepard's yeoman on the Normandy SR-2 in Mass Effect 2 whose primary role is administrative and clerical work. She keeps Commander Shepard notified of new e-mails and pass on meeting requests from Shepard's squad mates. In addition, Kelly utilizes her degree in psychology to provides counseling support and monitors the psychological state of Shepard and the crew. She is a romance option for a male or female Shepard, but does not grant the \"Paramour\" achievement. If she survives the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, she will appear in Mass Effect 3. She informs Shepard that she is on the run from Cerberus, her former employers. Shepard may ask her to continue assisting with the war effort, or go into hiding.\n\nPatrick Lee from AV Club brought up Chambers' potential fate in Mass Effect 3 as an example where a Paragon-aligned Shepard is \"not a saintly warrior-poet whose every decision is ethically and practically airtight\".\n\nAria T'Loak\nAria T'Loak, also known as \"the Pirate Queen\", is an asari organized crime boss who serves as the de facto ruler of Omega Station, an important hub in the lawless Terminus Systems. She owns the Afterlife Club, which serves as the station's central hub. Her first chronological appearance is in Mass Effect: Incursion, an 8-page prequel comic to Mass Effect 2. She then makes a cameo in Mass Effect: Redemption, briefly assisting Liara's search for the missing Shepard. In Mass Effect 2, Aria provides Shepard with information on Omega. She then appears in Mass Effect: Retribution, and in the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega, she appears as a temporary squad mate who wields powerful biotic abilities.\n\nAria T'Loak is voiced by Carrie-Anne Moss.\n\nArmando-Owen Bailey \nCaptain Armando-Owen Bailey is a human C-Sec officer stationed in the Zakera Ward of the Citadel in Mass Effect 2. In Mass Effect 3, he is promoted to C-Sec Commander in-charge of C-Sec operations of the Citadel Embassies quarters. He is a mostly upstanding officer, but is pragmatic enough to bend the rules if it is more convenient or rewarding for him.\n\nBailey is voiced by Michael Hogan.\n\nKal'Reegar\nKal'Reegar is a marine of the quarian Migrant Fleet who is assigned to protect Tali'Zorah, who is on a mission to perform research work on the planet Haestrom in Mass Effect 2.

He has chemically induced delusions of grandeur after being administered with biotic-enhancing drugs, manifesting minor biotic talents as a result. Game writer Brian Kindregan created Niftu Cal and added him into Mass Effect 2 as a joke character, where he became popular with fans as an internet meme.\n\nNiftu Cal is voiced by Mark Meer.\n\nFenlon from PC Gamer called Niftu Cal the \"funniest throwaway character BioWare ever created.\" A similar character archetype, a volus adept, was later added into Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode as a result of the character's popularity.\n\nSamantha Traynor\nCommunications Specialist Samantha Traynor appears in Mass Effect 3, serving in a similar role to that of her predecessor, Yeoman Kelly Chambers as Commander Shepard's personal assistant.

András Neltz from Kotaku considers the brief interaction with the character in Mass Effect 3 to expose a traitor as unique, as the player gets to experience the Spectres as independent agents who sometimes meet up to assist each other, noting that previous Spectre characters either end up dying or were antagonists to the player character. The character is named after BioWare writer John Dombrow.\n\nNyreen Kandros\nNyreen Kandros is the turian leader of the Talons mercenary organization on Omega, who joins Shepard as a temporary squad mate in the Mass Effect 3 DLC Omega.

SAM is permanently connected to the Pathfinder, and sees and feels as they do via a neural link, which was originally created by Alec's wife Dr. Elen Ryder. SAM handles a number of tasks as well as assists the Tempest's crew from its node in the Hyperion ark. Through the neural link and a quantum entanglement communication system, SAM can provide the Pathfinder with support in the form of “situational awareness, problem solving and even tactical enhancements”. SAM's computing power also enhances the Pathfinder's combat abilities in the form of six \"profiles\", which in gameplay terms is analogous to the class system from the original trilogy.\n\nSAM is voiced by Alexia Traverse-Healy.\n\nLexi T'Perro\nDr. Lexi T'Perro is the asari doctor on the human ark ship Hyperion, who is later transferred to the Tempest as the resident doctor.

The Pathfinder may find themselves navigating the moral shades of grey the Mass Effect series is known for in their dealings with Jarun. He also appears in the tie-in novel to Andromeda, Mass Effect Andromeda: Nexus Uprising, where he is portrayed as the central character of the uprising led by former security chief Sloane Kelly at the Nexus. Ben Gilbert from Business Insider mentioned Tann as an example of the best aspects of the Mass Effect series: characters \"who respond in realistic ways, who are just as likely to be honest as they are to be manipulative\".\n\nTann is voiced by Kumail Nanjiani.\n\nTiran Kandros\nTiran Kandros is the turian leader of the de facto volunteer militia for the Andromeda Initiative based in the Nexus, known as APEX, and the cousin of Nyreen Kandros.

During an introductory conversation with the Pathfinder shortly after they met, Abrams reveals that she was known as Stephan prior to her gender transitioning, which motivated her to join the Andromeda Initiative and depart from the Milky Way galaxy to start a new life.

Markopolos (born October 22, 1956) is an American former securities industry executive and a forensic accounting and financial fraud investigator.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2008, Markopolos uncovered evidence that suggested that Bernie Madoff's wealth management business was a huge Ponzi scheme. In 2000, 2001, and 2005, Markopolos alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of his views, supplying supporting documents, but each time the SEC ignored him or gave his evidence only a cursory investigation. Madoff was finally revealed to be a fraud in December 2008, when his sons contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After admitting to operating the largest private Ponzi scheme in history, Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison.\n\nIn 2010, Markopolos' book on uncovering the Madoff fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller, was published. Markopolos has criticized the SEC for failing to discover the Madoff fraud despite repeated tips, and for failing to investigate properly the larger companies it supervised. Critics of Markopolos have called him obsessive, a self-publicist, and self-righteous, and some questioned whether he was motivated by a financial bounty, which he denied.\n\nEducation and career \n\nMarkopolos attended Roman Catholic schools, graduating from Cathedral Preparatory School in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1974. He received an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loyola College in Maryland in 1981, and a Master of Science in Finance from Boston College in 1997.\nHe is a CFA charterholder, and a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE).\n\nHe began his career on Wall Street in 1987 as a broker with Makefield Securities, a small Erie-based brokerage. In 1988, he obtained a job with Darien Capital Management in Darien, Connecticut, as an assistant portfolio manager.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2004, he served as a portfolio manager at Boston-based options trading company Rampart Investment Management, ultimately becoming its chief investment officer.\n\nHe now works as a forensic accounting analyst for attorneys who sue companies under the False Claims Act and other laws, emphasizing tips that result in continuing investigations into medical billing, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Defense frauds, in which a \"whistleblower\" would be compensated.\n\nMadoff investigation \n\nDuring 1999, Markopolos learned that one of Rampart's frequent trading partners, Access International Advisors, was dealing with a hedge fund manager who consistently delivered net returns of 1% to 2% a month.\n\nFrank Casey, one of Rampart's principals, met with Access CEO René-Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet, and learned the manager was Bernie Madoff, who was operating a wealth management business in which his clients essentially gave him carte blanche to invest the money as he saw fit, in a set of securities. Casey and Rampart's managing partner, Dave Fraley, asked Markopolos to try to design a product similar to Madoff's split-strike conversion, in hopes of luring away Access from investing in Madoff.\n\nWhen Markopolos obtained a copy of Madoff's revenue stream, he spotted problems. The biggest red flag, he believed, was that the return stream rose steadily with only a few downticks – represented graphically by a nearly perfect 45-degree angle. According to Markopolos, anyone who understood the underlying math of the markets would have known that such a return stream \"simply doesn't exist in finance,\" since the markets were too volatile even in the most favorable conditions for this to be possible. Based on this and other factors, Markopolos eventually concluded that Madoff could not mathematically deliver his purported returns using the strategies he claimed to use. As he saw it, there were only two ways to explain the figures: Madoff was either running a Ponzi scheme (by paying established clients with newer clients' money) or front running (buying stock for his own and the hedge fund's accounts, based on insider knowledge about market impacts from about-to-be-executed client orders at his company's unrelated broker-dealer business).\n\nMarkopolos later said that he knew within five minutes that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. He claimed it took him another four hours to uncover enough evidence that he could mathematically prove that they could have been obtained only by fraud.\n\nDespite this, Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked Markopolos to deconstruct Madoff's strategy to see if he could replicate it. He could not simulate Madoff's returns, using information he had gathered about Madoff's trades in stocks and options. For instance, he discovered that for Madoff's strategy to work, he would have had to buy more options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange than actually existed.\n\nHis calculations of Madoff's trades revealed that there was almost no correlation between Madoff's stocks and the S&P 100, as Madoff claimed. Markopolos also could find no evidence that the market was responding to any Madoff trades, even though by his estimate Madoff was managing as much as $6 billion, three times more than any known hedge fund at the time. Given that Madoff's supposed trades should have had a substantial ripple effect on broader markets, Markopolos suspected that Madoff wasn't even trading.\n\nWith the help of two of his colleagues at Rampart, Casey and fellow quant Neil Chelo, Markopolos continued to probe the Madoff operation. What they found concerned him enough that he filed a formal complaint with the Boston office of the SEC during the spring of 2000. However, the SEC took no action. Nonetheless, others in the investing world took Markopolos' findings seriously. In 2000, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments dropped his plans to study Madoff's strategies after a meeting with Markopolos. Tillinghast wrote years later that his discussion with Markopolos convinced him that Madoff was almost certainly engaging in fraud; as he put it, \"nothing in Madoff's ostensible strategy made sense.\"\n\nMichael Ocrant, editor-in-chief of MARHedge, joined the effort to publicize Madoff's questionable actions. Casey surprised Ocrant with information that Madoff, whom Ocrant only knew to be one of the largest market makers on NASDAQ and one of the largest brokers on the New York Stock Exchange, actually ran a secretive multi-billion dollar hedge fund, directly managing investors' money. Ocrant investigated and wrote an article, \"Madoff tops charts; skeptics ask how\", published May 1, 2001, questioning Madoff's returns. Within a week, Erin Arvedlund followed with an investigative article in Barron's, further questioning Madoff's secrecy and results; despite the details in these scathing articles, they generated no action from the SEC, and did not scare off Madoff's existing investors.\n\nMarkopolos sent a more detailed submission to the SEC a year later. He also offered to let the SEC send him to Madoff's headquarters undercover, obtain the trading tickets, and compare them with the Options Price Reporting Authority tape. By then, Markopolos was convinced that Madoff was not really trading. He believed that his trading tickets would not match the OPRA tape, which would have been hard proof that Madoff was a fraud. This submission also passed without action from the SEC.\n\nFrom the beginning, Markopolos believed that Madoff was most likely running a Ponzi scheme, given his voracious appetite for cash; a Ponzi scheme can last only as long as new money is flowing in to pay existing investors. His colleagues, Casey and Chelo, were more inclined to think that Madoff was front running. Casey and Chelo believed Madoff was already a very wealthy man, and on paper it made no sense for him essentially to steal billions of dollars that he didn't need. They suspected that it was more feasible for him to increase his returns on actual trades via front-running. Markopolos, however, doubted this, since front-runners don't need the massive amount of new investor money that Madoff kept bringing in. Additionally, Markopolos believed that if Madoff was front-running, he would have to siphon off money from his broker-dealer arm to pay the investors in his hedge fund. This would have resulted in the customers of his broker-dealer operation getting shortchanged — something that would not have gone unnoticed by Madoff's more sophisticated broker-dealer customers.\n\nSoon after his second submission, Markopolos traveled to Europe with Magon de La Villehuchet to help get investors for an alternative product to Madoff that he'd developed for Rampart. While in Europe, Markopolos found that 14 different funds, at various firms, were invested with Madoff. Each manager believed that his fund was the only one from which Madoff was taking new money, a classic \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\" scenario. When Markopolos heard this, he was convinced that Madoff's wealth-management business was a Ponzi scheme.\n\nMarkopolos persevered, even though he felt that it created a considerable risk to his own safety. He learned during his European tour that a large number of funds invested with Madoff operated offshore. To his mind, this was evidence that the Russian mafia and Latin-American drug cartels were invested with  Madoff, and might want to silence anyone who threatened the viability of the hedge funds.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, Markopolos came up with a plan to deliver an investigative file anonymously to an aide of then Attorney General of New York Eliot Spitzer as Spitzer delivered a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. He put on a pair of white gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints, and wore an oversize coat.\n\nEven after leaving Rampart in 2004, frustrated that he was in a business that had to compete with cheats and lawbreakers, Markopolos continued to be driven by the intellectual challenge of solving the problem, and the ongoing encouragement from Boston SEC staffer Ed Manion. The culmination of Markopolos' analysis was a 21-page memo sent during November 2005 to SEC regulators, entitled \"The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud\". It outlined his suspicions in more detail and invited officials to check his theories. He outlined 30 red flags that he believed proved Madoff's returns could not be legitimate. His analysis was based on more than 14 years of Madoff return numbers, during which time Madoff reported only four losing months, an implausible scenario that Markopolos said could be achieved only by fraud. In the document Markopolos states:\n\nAlthough Madoff's scheme did not collapse until 2008, Markopolos believed that Madoff was on the brink of insolvency as early as the summer of 2005, when Casey found out that at least two banks were no longer lending money to their clients to invest with Madoff. This prompted Madoff to seek loans from banks. In June 2008 – six months before Madoff's scheme imploded – Markopolos' team uncovered evidence that Madoff was accepting leveraged money. In his book, Markopolos wrote that this was a sign Madoff was running out of cash and needed to increase his intake of new funds to keep the scheme going.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Markopolos told a conference at Boston College, his alma mater, that he believed Madoff personally kept less than 1 percent of the $65 billion reported stolen, and would probably lose what remained of his portion to money launderers. Markopolos estimated that $35 billion to $55 billion of the money Madoff claimed to have stolen never really existed, but were simply fictional profits he reported to his clients. Markopolos believed that Madoff's customers lost $10 billion to $35 billion, most of which went to early investors. \"Madoff will wind up in a special prison designed as much to keep the crook's victims out as Madoff in. He's a guy who can't afford not to be in prison,\" he said. Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet committed suicide soon after Madoff's scheme collapsed, having lost $1.5 billion of his own and clients' money.\n\nCongressional testimony \nOn February 4, 2009, Markopolos testified before the United States Congress' House Financial Services Committee's capital markets panel and on March 1, appeared on CBS's 60 Minutes.\n\nMarkopolos harshly criticized the SEC for ignoring his warnings about Madoff. \"Nothing was done. There was an abject failure by the regulatory agencies we entrust as our watchdog,\" he said in 65 pages of prepared testimony. He said that his original 2000 complaint gave the SEC enough evidence to stop Madoff when he was supposedly managing as little as $3 billion.\n\nDescribing Madoff as \"one of the most powerful men on Wall Street,\" Markopolos stated that there was \"great danger\" in investigating him: \"My team and I surmised that if Mr. Madoff gained knowledge of our activities, he may feel threatened enough to seek to stifle us.\" He testified that he feared for his, as well as his family's safety, until after Madoff's arrest, when the SEC finally acknowledged that it had received \"credible evidence\" of Madoff's Ponzi scheme years before. He said that Madoff's \"math never made sense,\" that his \"return stream never resembled any known financial instrument or strategy,\" and that Madoff wasn't making the volumes of trades he claimed. According to Markopolos, the best warning about Madoff came during his initial analysis of 87 months (a little more than seven years) of Madoff trades. During that time, Madoff reported only three losing months. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index reported 28 losing months during the same period. He likened Madoff's purported returns to a baseball player batting .966 for the season and \"no one suspecting a cheat\".\n\nMarkopolos had originally concealed his identity from SEC regulators during May 1999, although he did meet face-to-face with SEC officials in Boston during 2000 and 2001. After the SEC did not respond, Markopolos was fearful of taking his complaints to the industry's self-regulatory authority, the National Association of Securities Dealers (since succeeded by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)).\n\nHe not only feared the power of Madoff's brother, Peter, had in that organization (he is a former Vice Chairman), but also feared that Madoff might have had associations with Russian and South American organized crime. Markopolos believed the FBI would reject his allegations without the SEC staff's endorsement. He believed that only a few SEC officials, including Manion and SEC Boston branch chief Mike Garrity, understood Madoff's operation well enough to detect the fraud. Markopolos met with Garrity during 2005, and said that while Garrity realized almost immediately that Madoff was violating the law, he could not take any action because Madoff was not based in New England.\n\nMarkopolos later wrote that a few days after that meeting, Garrity called him and said his preliminary investigation revealed serious irregularities in the Madoff operation, and that he would have had inspection teams \"tearing the place apart\" if Madoff had been based in New England. However, since the Boston office's jurisdiction extended only as far as Greenwich, Connecticut; Garrity had no choice but to pass it down to the New York office. \"My experiences with other SEC officials proved to be a systemic disappointment and led me to conclude that the SEC securities lawyers, if only through their investigative ineptitude and financial illiteracy, colluded to maintain large frauds such as the one to which Madoff later confessed.\"\n\nHe also added that during 2005 it was Meaghan Cheung, the branch chief of the SEC's New York office, to whom he gave his 21-page report alleging that Madoff was paying old investors with money from fresh recruits. \"Ms. Cheung never expressed even the slightest interest in asking me questions\", Markopolos said, claiming she was too concerned with Markopolos mentioning the possibility of a reward and the fact that he was a competitor of Madoff. Cheung approved an internal memo during November 2007 to close an SEC investigation of Madoff without bringing any claim. Subsequently, she left the agency. He testified he gave details about the case during 2005 to John Wilke, an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, but that it was never pursued. Markopolos testified he (anonymously) sent a package of documents concerning Madoff to former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had successfully prosecuted a number of securities fraud cases, but that Spitzer apparently did not act, either. Spitzer's family firm had invested in Madoff's business.\n\n\"Government has coddled, accepted, and ignored white-collar crime for too long,\" he testified. \"It is time the nation woke up and realized that it's not the armed robbers or drug dealers who cause the most economic harm, it's the white collar criminals living in the most expensive homes who have the most impressive resumes who harm us the most. They steal our pensions, bankrupt our companies, and destroy thousands of jobs, ruining countless lives.\" He testified to Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-NY) that he had never been compensated for his efforts. \"I did it for our flag, for patriotism.\" Markopolos presented recommendations to improve the SEC's operations, which included mandatory department standards: good ethics, full transparency, full disclosure, and fair dealing for all. The SEC must establish a unit to accept \"whistleblower\" tips, and move its activity closer to financial centers away from Washington, D.C.\n\nHis testimony included a reference to another $1 billion Ponzi scheme, which he shared the next day with SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, who gave the tips to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. He disclosed information regarding a dozen as-yet-unknown foreign Madoff feeder funds, \"hiding in the weeds\" in Europe, the victims of which likely included Russian mafia and drug cartels, \"dirty money\" investors. Markopolos remarked that European royal families had also lost assets.\n\nBecause of concerns of improper conduct by Inspector General Kotz in the Madoff investigation, Inspector General David C. Williams of the United States Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review. The Williams Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was a \"very good friend\" with Markopolos. Investigators were not able to determine when Kotz and Markopolos became friends. A violation of the ethics rule would have taken place if the friendship had been concurrent with Kotz's investigation of Madoff.\n\nOther statements \nIn his interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes, Markopolos said the biggest warning he noticed during his initial 1999 analysis of Madoff was that he reported losing months only four percent of the time. To Markopolos' mind, no one could possibly be that good, given the volatility of the markets. \"As we know, markets go up and down, and his only went up,\" he said. Markopolos noted that during his tenure at Rampart, he traded with some of the biggest derivatives companies in the world, and none of them dealt with Madoff, because they didn't think his numbers were real. He admitted that he had some financial incentive to eliminate Madoff, as the two competed against each other from 2000 to 2004. However, he said, he felt compelled to pursue it, because \"when someone's competing on your playing field, who's a dirty player, you want him tossed off the field.\" He assailed the SEC once again for ignoring his warnings, saying that the only reason Madoff was caught was that he ultimately collapsed under the weight of his own lies.\n\nMarkopolos expanded on his criticism of the SEC in No One Would Listen. He claimed that SEC regulators don't have nearly enough expertise to understand the various products offered in the modern market; as he put it, the SEC was still \"panning by hand\". He also believed that the SEC's enforcement staff didn't take his complaints seriously, because they were expecting legal proof Madoff was a fraud, not the mathematical evidence he provided. To his mind, the investigators didn't understand that mathematical proof was stronger evidence than legal proof, because \"with a math problem, there is only one correct answer.\"\n\nAs a result of the Madoff scandal, the SEC's chairman Christopher Cox stated that an investigation will delve into \"all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm.\"\n\n2019 General Electric fraud allegation \nIn 2019, Markopolos published a report alleging fraudulent accounting within General Electric. The report caused the company's stock to drop 10.3% on August 15, 2019. The stock closed at $9.03 prior to the report, and then closed at $8.01 the following day when the report was published.  Markopolos claimed GE was a fraud \"bigger than Enron.\" Subsequently, GE called the report \"meritless\" and an attempt at \"market manipulation\" by Markopolos; Wall Street analysts shrugged off the report; and the regulators called the report \"fairly simplistic.\"  A Financial Times article labeled the report \"some ill-thought out twaddle disguised as deep financial analysis.\" The Markopolos website (www.gefraud.com) alleging this giant fraud disappeared after criticism about the quality of his analyses.  The full report is still available, however, in internet archives. Three months after the 175 page Markopolos report, GE stock had risen almost 44% to close at $11.52 on November 15, outperforming the general stock market.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg in November 2021, \"For GE, the never-ending storm may pass, but at the moment, its future looks cloudy.\"\n\nPersonal life \nMarkopolos is the eldest of three children of Georgia and Louis Markopolos, Greek-American restaurateurs.\n\nHis father and two uncles once owned 12 Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips restaurants in Maryland and Delaware. His younger brother, Louie, once managed the trading office for a New Jersey brokerage company. He has a sister, Melissa.\n\nHe and his wife Faith, who works in the financial industry for an investment company conducting due diligence of portfolio managers, have three sons, two of whom ⁠ – Harry \"Hare Bear\" Markopolos and Louis \"Big Lou\" Markopolos ⁠ – are twins.\n\nBibliography \nMarkopolos's account of the Madoff scandal was published in book titled, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller. The book was released in 2010.\n\nFilmography \nChasing Madoff, a documentary film based on the book was released in 2011.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Markopolos interview (mp3) King World News (May 29, 2009).

He is best known for bringing to light the largest Ponzi scheme in American history, that of Bernie Madoff, in 2008. Markopolos worked on Wall Street for 20 years, including as a portfolio manager for a Boston-based hedge fund, for which he was the primary investment officer. In 2000, while investigating the investment portfolio of a client, he discovered what he claimed were \"consistent, persistent and overwhelming\" red flags that the client, Bernie Madoff, was engaged in securities fraud. Over the next eight years, Markopolos tried to alert the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to what he believed was Madoff's fraud, but the SEC did not act on his warnings. In 2008, Markopolos's investment fund, entrusted with $700 million, suffered massive losses as a result of the financial crisis, and he was forced to liquidate it. With the help of his attorney, David Mariss, he then sent a detailed letter to the SEC that included a description of the alleged fraud, as well as a list of questions he wanted the SEC to ask Madoff. Instead of investigating Madoff, the SEC investigated Markopolos, and, in 2009, charged him with securities fraud, alleging that he had tried to defraud the agency by falsely alleging fraud on the part of Madoff. The SEC settled its case with Markopolos in 2012, and he is now a whistleblower for the SEC. In 2010, Markopolos provided the first testimony to Congress concerning the causes of the financial crisis, specifically with respect to the role of the SEC. In his testimony, he claimed that the SEC had failed in its mission to protect investors, and that it was \"broken, inefficient, and poorly managed\". In 2013, Markopolos published a book about his experience trying to expose Madoff's fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller. In 2014, the story of Markopolos's detection of the Madoff fraud was adapted into a television movie, The Wizard of Lies, starring Robert De Niro as Madoff and Markopolos. In 2015, Markopolos was featured in the documentary film The Madoff Tapes. In 2016, Markopolos was featured in the documentary film The Big Short, about the financial crisis, where he was interviewed about his experiences investigating the mortgage-backed securities market.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 20800581}

The Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum is in Ranger. The museum covers the history of the Texas Rangers, from their foundation in the mid-19th century to the present day. It includes a recreation of the Ranger jail, as well as many exhibits of weapons used by Rangers and the outlaws they chased. The museum is located at the site of the former Texas Ranger Force headquarters. This building was constructed in the early 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. The museum opened in 1964 and was donated to the state of Texas in 1968. The Former Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum, now known as the Texas Ranger Heritage Center, is located in the former Ranger jail, which was restored by the city in 2004. It features displays about the town of Ranger and the Texas Rangers, as well as a collection of historic photographs. Ranger is also home to the T.A. Blood Jr. Regional Airport. The airport, named after former Ranger mayor T.A. Blood, Jr., features a 4,300-foot (1,300 m) runway. Every third Saturday in October, Ranger holds the Texas Ranger Day celebration.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"The Art Genome Project\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Art Genome Project is the search technology behind Artsy.\n\nThe Art Genome Project's search technology is the product of an ongoing art-historical study—undertaken by a team of contributors with art-historical backgrounds at Artsy—seeking to define the characteristics which distinguish and connect works of art, architecture, ancient artifacts and design.\n\nIts primary aim is to provide Artsy users dynamic search categories and explain similarities among art and artists. Currently, there are 1000+ \"genes\" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project's taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities. These genes are the product of Artsy's team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy's platform.\n\nThere are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as \"genes,\" and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating \"genomes\" for both—for the artsy.net site.\n\nImportantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way< than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.\n\nArtsy's \"genes\" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see \"related\" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see \"related\" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy's Browse page.\n\nThe Art Genome Project provides metadata for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of information retrieval (TF/IDF) and presents results in a UX-driven search product.\n\nMatthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.\n\nPrecedents for The Art Genome Project \n\nThe Art Genome Project has often been compared to Pandora's Music Genome Project, and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora's Joe Kennedy. Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call \"genes\". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.\n\nThe Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of Big Data, which is a sector of algorithmic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy's genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually. Netflix also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. Amazon Art makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.\n\nMuseums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as Google Art Project and Artstor, digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.\n\nThe Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork \n\nArt historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.\n\nMost college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.\n\nGenes versus Tags \n\nIn the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, \"Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged \"dog\" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism.\"\n\nImportantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.\n\nReception\n\nPositive Reception \nDigtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP \"user-friendly,\" \"intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts.\" Complex.com highlighted genes in their article \"15 Awesome Genes on Artsy\"  to show \"just how incredible their project is.\"\n\nIn the New York Times, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, \"sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’\"\n\nJonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: \"Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly.\"\n\nCriticism \nCriticism around The Art Genome Project centers on \"its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way.\"\n\nSome critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: \"'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with Cindy Sherman,' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of.\" Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Art Genome Project\n\nArts databases", "machine_text": " The Art Genome Project The Art Genome Project is a project and ongoing research initiative of the Art.com Group, Inc. launched in February 2008. The project is designed to create a comprehensive database of art history based on the analysis of art works. The Art Genome Project uses a complex set of algorithms and taxonomies to organize, analyze, and interpret art works and their relationships with other art works. The project is based on the idea that all art works are a combination of artistic genes, based on their creator, subject, style, and other attributes. These genes combine in different ways to create art works. The Art Genome Project's database contains over 100,000 art works and over 1,000,000 genes. The Art Genome Project uses the concept of a \"genome\" as a means to organize and categorize art. The word genome is a blend of the Greek gene, which means \"origin,\" and the Latin genoma, which means \"model.\" The genome is a set of instructions, or a map, for the growth and development of a living organism. In the same way, the Art Genome Project's database is a set of instructions, or a map, for the growth and development of art. The Art Genome Project is intended to be a tool for the study and understanding of art.

For part of this time he was a counselor in the mission presidency of the mission. In this position he created a translation of the Melchizedek priesthood handbook into Spanish for use throughout the mission.\n\nTullis began his undergraduate education at the University of Utah. He later transferred to BYU where he earned a bachelor's degree in Spanish. Tullis received his master's degree in political science from Brigham Young University. He also did graduate studies at Cornell University and earned an master's of public administration degree. Tullis has a doctorate in political science earned at Harvard University. He spent a year teaching at Arizona State University before he joined the BYU faculty. He has been a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and the University of Sussex from 1983-1984.

By exercising these powers in concert, Congress may effectively eliminate any judicial review of certain federal legislative or executive actions and of certain state actions, or alternatively transfer the judicial review responsibility to state courts by \"knocking [federal courts] ... out of the game.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton had this to say about the issue in The Federalist:\n\nFrom this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the system.  If some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences.\n\nTransfer of authority to state judiciaries\nFramers of the Constitution, such as Roger Sherman of Connecticut, did not envision jurisdiction stripping as invariably insulating a law from judicial review, and instead foresaw that state judiciaries could determine compatibility of certain types of state statutes with federal laws and the federal Constitution.  In 1788, Sherman publicly explained that,\n\nIt was thought necessary in order to carry into effect the laws of the Union, to promote justice, and preserve harmony among the states, to extend the judicial powers of the United States to the enumerated cases, under such regulations and with such exceptions as shall be provided by law, which will doubtless reduce them to cases of such magnitude and importance as cannot be safely trusted to the final decisions of the courts of particular states; and the constitution does not make it necessary that any inferior tribunals should be instituted, but it may be done if found necessary; 'tis probable that courts of particular states will be authorized by the laws of the union, as has heretofore been done in cases of piracy, &c. ...\n\nThus, there are two kinds of jurisdiction-stripping: one which changes the court that will hear the case (as Sherman envisioned), versus one which essentially insulates statutes from judicial review altogether.  Jurisdiction-stripping statutes usually take away no substantive rights but rather change the court that will hear the case.\n\nCongress has sometimes limited federal involvement in state cases, for example by setting a minimum amount in controversy in order to bar the lower federal courts from hearing diversity cases that involve less than that amount (currently $75,000), combined with precluding a right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Likewise, Congress has never required that state court cases involving federal questions be removed or appealed to federal court, and so the federal courts are unable to exercise power in many of those cases.\n\nLimits\nCongress may not strip the U.S. Supreme Court of jurisdiction over those cases that fall under the Court's original jurisdiction defined in the U.S. Constitution. Congress can limit only the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in, \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party. ... \"  This last state-shall-be-a-party language has not been interpreted by the Court as meaning that it has original jurisdiction merely because a state is a plaintiff or defendant, even if a provision of the U.S. Constitution is at issue. Rather, the Court has started that the controversy must be between two or more states, or between a state and citizens of another state, or between a state and foreigners.  Additionally, in 1892, the Court decided that it has original jurisdiction in cases between a state and the United States.\n\nStory's theory\nJustice Joseph Story, in his opinion in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee and in his other writings, wrote extensively about how Congress should ensure that the judicial power is properly vested in the federal courts.  Professor Akhil Amar credits Story with the theory that Congress may not concurrently remove the jurisdiction of inferior courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over certain categories of claims, as doing so would violate the Constitution's mandatory grant of jurisdiction over such claims to the judiciary as a whole.  Story wrote in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee:\n\nThe judicial power shall extend to all the cases enumerated in the constitution.   As the mode is not limited, it may extend to all such cases, in any form, in which judicial power may be exercised.  It may, therefore, extend to them in the shape of original or appellate jurisdiction, or both; for there is nothing in the nature of the cases which binds to the exercise of the one in preference to the other.\n\nAccording to Amar, Story's exposition of federal court jurisdiction \"has generated considerable confusion\" and furthermore, as Amar understands Story's theory, it \"simply cannot be right\".  Professor Henry M. Hart instead argued that Congress may strip the power of the federal judiciary to hear certain classes of cases. Hart wrote: \"In the scheme of the Constitution [state courts] are the primary guarantors of constitutional rights, and in many cases they may be the ultimate ones.\"\n\nCalabresi's theory\nIn 2007, law professors Steven Calabresi and Gary Lawson opined that Congress can strip the U.S. Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction only to the extent that Congress expands the Court's original jurisdiction.  Calabresi and Lawson acknowledged that their theory contradicts the holding of Marbury v. Madison, according to which the Constitution's description of the Court's original jurisdiction is exhaustive.\n\nAccording to Calabresi and Lawson, Congress has no ability to alter or make exceptions to the judicial power of the United States, or to do anything less than bring the full judicial power into execution.  The Calabresi theory finds support in a 2010 article by Washburn University Law Professor Alex Glashausser.  On the other hand, Judge William A. Fletcher wrote an article in 2010 taking the opposite point of view.\n\nRelated issues\nGenerally speaking, the word \"power\" is not necessarily synonymous with the word \"jurisdiction\".  For instance, courts will often assert a modest degree of power over a case for purposes of determining whether it has jurisdiction, or for purposes of receiving jurisdiction.\n\nThe Constitution vests the judicial power \"in one supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time establish\" (emphasis added).  Scholars have debated whether the word \"in\" means that the entire judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and is also vested entirely in the inferior courts; that possibility has implications for what the vesting of such power means.\n\nOther relevant Supreme Court cases\nDuring Reconstruction, Congress withdrew jurisdiction from a case the U.S. Supreme Court was then in the process of adjudicating.  In terminating the case Ex Parte McCardle, 74 US 506 (1869), the Justices acknowledged the authority of Congress to intervene.\n\nWe are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature.  We can only examine into its power under the Constitution; and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words. ... It is quite clear, therefore, that this court cannot proceed to pronounce judgment in this case, for it has no longer jurisdiction of the appeal; and judicial duty is not less fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws confer.\n\nIn 1882, the Supreme Court again conceded that its own \"actual jurisdiction is confined within such limits as Congress sees fit to describe.\"\n\nIn 1948, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter conceded in a dissenting opinion that \"Congress need not give this Court any appellate power; it may withdraw appellate jurisdiction once conferred.\"\n\nIn 1972, Chief Justice Warren Burger made it known, concurring with the denial of certiorari to Volpe v. D. C. Federation of Civic Associations, that he believed Congress could do anything in its power to make its intentions clear, \"even to the point of limiting or prohibiting judicial review of its directives in this respect.\" This was recorded in reference to a particular dispute with a court of appeal, which he accused of \"unjustifiably frustrat[ing] the efforts of the Executive Branch to comply with the will of Congress.\" However, 10 days earlier, President Nixon had made a statement indicating his opposition to school busing for racial integration. In that context, Burger's statement was interpreted at the time as suggesting that Congress prohibit busing with legislation and enforce that legislation with jurisdiction stripping.\n\nFurther federal statutes\nMore recent examples of jurisdiction stripping include the following:\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (inter alia, stripped the federal judiciary of its jurisdiction to review certain Immigration and Naturalization Service decisions),\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (restricting the remedies available to prison inmates),\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (limiting the number of habeas corpus petitions available to prison inmates),\nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, ruled as unconstitutional denial of the right of habeas corpus pursuant to the Suspension clause in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006).\nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006 (Strip all Federal Courts of the U.S. jurisdiction to hear appeal or cases from Guantanamo Bay Detainee) Ruled Unconstitutional in the case of Boumediene v. Bush (2008).\n\nThere have also been hundreds of unsuccessful bills in Congress to strip federal courts of jurisdiction.\n\nSee also\nOuster clause\nSeparation of powers under the United States Constitution\n\nReferences\n\nJurisdiction\nUnited States constitutional law\nFederal judiciary of the United States\nTerminology of the United States Congress\nPolitical terminology of the United States", "machine_text": " Jurisdiction stripping is the legal term for the set of tactics in which a state reduces the sovereignty of another state. The state that is the victim of jurisdiction stripping is typically a small state, and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping is typically a large state. The term was coined by Robert Jackson in a 1981 article entitled \"The New UN Law of Self-Determination\". Jurisdiction stripping can take many forms. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may announce, for example, that it no longer recognizes the independence of the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's territory. Jurisdiction stripping is often accomplished by the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping by simply declaring that the victim state is no longer independent. The victim state may have a very small military force and the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have a very large military force. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its large military force to occupy the victim state. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its large military force to occupy the victim state's territory. Once the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping has occupied the victim state or the victim state's territory, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then integrate the victim state into its own legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also take over the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to interpret the victim state's tax laws. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. There are many variations on jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may strip jurisdiction from another state with which it has a territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may then use its own legal system to adjudicate the territorial dispute. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes involving the victim state. For example, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may use its own legal system to settle disputes over tax payments or other financial matters. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also use its own legal system to settle disputes over the victim state's natural resources. There are also many variations on the types of states that are guilty of jurisdiction stripping. For example, a state may be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not formally announce that it has stripped the victim state of its sovereignty. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it occupies the victim state's territory and integrates the victim state into its own legal system, but does not take over the victim state's government. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. A state may also be guilty of jurisdiction stripping if it uses its own legal system to interpret the victim state's laws, but does not use its own legal system to adjudicate disputes involving the victim state. In this case, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may have to allow the victim state to maintain its own legal system. The legal consequences of jurisdiction stripping can be severe. If a state strips another state of its sovereignty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's debts and liabilities. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's natural resources. In addition, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's legal system. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's government. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's international legal obligations. For example, if the victim state has signed onto an international treaty, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of the treaty. The state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may also be responsible for the victim state's relationships with other states. For example, if the victim state has diplomatic relations with other states, the state that is guilty of jurisdiction stripping may be responsible for the victim state's compliance with the terms of those relationships.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7890213}

The event is organised by Surf Life Saving Australia.\n\nThe Event\n\nHistory\nIn 1984, Peter Schrek was writing a movie featuring the talents of ironman legend Grant Kenny, about two brothers competing for their father's love. Needing a dramatic climax for the movie, Schrek was sitting on a Gold Coast beach when he came up with the idea of racing from Surfers Paradise, all the way down to Coolangatta, and back up again. Schrek ran up to someone on the beach, and after explaining the course, asked if he would do it, to which the person replied, \"Hell no\". Schreck then asked if he would do it for $20,000 prize money, to which the person replied, \"Hell Yeah\".\n\nFor the filming of the race, the producers decided to run The Coolangatta Gold as an actual event, rather than film set up shots. Many well-known ironmen at the time competed, but it was won by the unheralded 18-year-old Guy Leech, from Manly. Leech went on to win the second race in 1985 in conjunction with the movie premiere, and again in 1989 in The Gold Coast Gold. The race was run again in 1991 and 1992, won by Michael King and Darren Mercer respectively (with local Daiman Cartan coming a very close second both times), before escalating costs prevented it from being held again.\n\nIn 2005, it was on again, this time with a new women's and master's events. In the men's race, Caine Eckstein would mirror the events of the original race and the movie, running past his brother Shannon Eckstein, and defeating much more recognised ironmen in Zane Holmes, Dean Mercer and Jeremy Cotter.\n\nThe 2006 race saw Zane Holmes become the only ironman in history to win a series title, and Australian title, a World Championship and the Coolangatta Gold. 2007 continued the tradition of upsets with veteran Rhys Drury making a break in the board leg and taking win.\nThe period from 2008 to 2011 saw a domination from Caine Eckstein. After returning to win his second title in 2008, Eckstein was pushed all the way in 2009 by veteran Dean Mercer, and in doing so, broke race record pace by over ten minutes, and equalled Cuy Leech's record of three wins. In 2010, after racing with Cory Hill in the ski leg down to Coolangatta, Eckstein broke away to win by almost ten minutes, and became the first competitor to win three in a row. He extended this record in 2011, and his victories now stands at five.\n\nThe period from 2012 to 2021 was dominated by Ali Day who won every Coolangatta Gold he contested. In 2013 Day became only the third competitor to win the event twice. In 2014 the event celebrated 30 years. Defending champion Ali Day did not contest the race due to fatigue and injury. During the board leg, in a bid to win his sixth crown, Caine Eckstein tore his bicep and was forced to withdraw. Josh Minogue broke through for his maiden victory after placing third three times in four years and retired from surf racing. In 2015 Ali Day returned and beat Nathan Smith, becoming only the second competitor to win the event three times. Day won again in 2016 beating his former Mooloolaba training partner Matt Bevilacqua. The 2017 race began with a minute's silence for Dean Mercer who died in August 2017. All competitors wore black wrist bands with the inscription “Doing it for Dean”. Shannon Eckstein returned to contest the event for the first time in 9 years. Ali Day and Shannon Eckstein were locked together in the opening ski leg, but Day increased his lead on each successive leg to finish more than six minutes ahead of Shannon Eckstein and equal Caine Eckstein's record of 5 wins. In 2018 Ali Day claimed a record-breaking sixth Coolangatta Gold crown by a record margin finishing 21 minutes ahead of 2nd placed Max Beattie of New Zealand. After breaking both wrists in July 2019 and the cancellation of the 2020 event due to COVID-19 restrictions, Ali Day returned in 2021 to win a historic 7th Coolangatta Gold and become the first Ironman in history to take out the triple Ironman crown in the same year - the Nutri-Grain Grain Ironman, Australian Ironman crown and the Coolangatta Gold.  \n\nIn the Uncle Toby's Super Series, a similar version of the race was held, called The Gold Coast Gold. While not officially recognised as the same race, The Gold Coast Gold was essentially the same race, and utilised a similar course to that used today. It was the first event of the new breakaway series in November 1989, and was won by Guy Leech, who extended his unbeaten record. In 1991, Jonathon Crowe after breaking away in the swim, just held on in the final run leg. In 1995, Scott Reeves won, and became the last man to win the Gold Coast Gold\n\nWinners\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nGold Coast Gold Results\n\nThe Course\nThe course for the 1984 and 85 events were as follows:\nAn  run from Surfers Paradise, over Burliegh Heads to Tallebudegra Creek, a wade across the creek, a short run to the ocean followed by a  swim towards Currumbin, a transition to the board leg at Bilinga, which then took the competitors down to Coolangatta beach, where they turned north and paddled a ski all the way back to Surfers Paradise.\n\nFor The Gold Coast Gold, the course was essentially reversed, with a ski leg from Surfers Paradise to Coolangatta, followed by a board to Tugun, a short run into the Currumbin Alley, a swim, a run and then another swim along Palm Beach and around Burleigh Heads, before the final  run to Surfers Paradise.\n\nFor the reintroduction of the race in 2005, the course was re-modified again.\nThe 2006 course was as follows:\n\nThe race has used this format ever since, although since 2010, it has started and finished at Kurrawa beach, and as such, the Ski and Run legs now include a loop up to Northcliffe surf club and then back down to Kurrawa.\n\nReferences\n\nSport on the Gold Coast, Queensland\nSurf lifesaving\nAustralian sports television series\nLifesaving in Australia\nCoolangatta", "machine_text": " The Coolangatta Gold The Coolangatta Gold is a surf life saving event, held annually at Coolangatta Beach, Queensland, Australia.

The cable is pulled along the track by a powered cable-pulling device. The term \"funistrada\" is a portmanteau of the words \"funicular\" and \"tramway\". A funistrada is similar to a funicular in that it has two stations and cars that run on a track. However, a funistrada is different from a funicular in that it is designed for higher-capacity passenger service, has lower operating costs, and can run at higher speeds. The first funistrada was built in New York City in 1871. It was called the First Avenue Line and it ran from the Cooperstown neighborhood in Manhattan to the First Avenue Ferry. The line was built by the First Avenue Railroad Company. The cars were pulled by a cable that was powered by a steam engine. The cable ran along a track that was suspended from a series of trestles. The line was designed by John A. Roebling, who also designed the Brooklyn Bridge. The funistrada was an early example of a transit system that was designed to be efficient and affordable. It was designed to provide a high level of service at a low cost. The cars were built to be light and the track was built to be durable. The funistrada was also designed to be safe. The cars were equipped with brakes and the track was built to be free of obstacles. The funistrada was a popular form of transportation in the 19th century. It was used to transport people and goods in many cities in the United States and Europe. However, the funistrada began to be replaced by other forms of transportation, such as the automobile and the subway, in the early 20th century. The last funistrada in the United States was built in Portland, Oregon in 1940.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21070428}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"USS Hollister\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "USS Hollister (DD-788) was a  of the United States Navy, named for the three Hollister brothers, who were killed in 1943 while serving in the Navy during World War II.\n\nConstruction and career \nHollister was launched on 9 October 1945 by Todd Shipyard, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Howard J. Hollister, mother of the three Hollister brothers; and commissioned on 29 March 1946, Commander W. T. Samuels in command.\n\nService in the United States Navy \nAfter shakedown along the California coast, Hollister departed San Diego, California on 9 November 1946 for operations in the Far East. She arrived Shanghai, on 1 December and later that month assisted the Korean Government in the prevention of smuggling. She continued operations in Far Eastern waters until returning to San Diego on 22 June 1947. For the next 14 months Hollister engaged in training exercises and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast.\n\nHollister departed on 1 September 1948 for her second deployment in the western Pacific where she joined the 7th Fleet on peacekeeping operations. She returned to Long Beach on 24 April 1949 and operated in California waters until July 1950.\n\nKorean War \nImmediately after North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, the United States committed its military might to halting aggression. Hollister was among the first reinforcements rushed to the battle area, departing San Diego on 5 July. Operating with Fast Carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77), she served as a screening ship and performed plane guard duty. In mid-September Hollister engaged in support of the highly successful landing at Inchon.\n\nThe 3d Battalion, 5th Marines landed at 06:33, 15 September. Later that day General Douglas MacArthur praised the performance saying that \"The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\" A week later Hollister took Rear Admiral Ewen (TF-77) for a conference with Commander 7th Fleet. In a message to his command, Admiral Ewen echoed MacArthur in praising its work: \"The performance of Task Force 77 throughout the Inchon operations has added another page to the glorious history of our Navy and its airpower. It has been made possible only through the determination, the relentless effort and the esprit de corps of a team that is really great. Task Force 77 will sail for the high seas soon and will stay at sea until the North Korean Communists have their bellies full ...\" In late September the destroyer was detached for diversionary bombardment in Communist-held areas, effectively weakening enemy positions as American forces smashed north.\n\nIn early November 1950, Hollister sailed with the Formosa Straits patrol, returning to Korea in mid-December for support of the Hŭngnam evacuation. She continued support operations, anti-junk patrols and shore bombardment before returning to San Diego on 11 April 1951. Hollister operated in the San Diego area until she returned to Korean action a year later. In late April 1955, she resumed duties with Task Force 77, including fire-support missions, patrol, antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and screening duty. Hollister joined the Formosa patrol in August, but resumed operations in Korea before returning to San Diego on 18 November.\n\nThe veteran ship operated out of San Diego until 21 July 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour. Hollister engaged in patrols both off Korea and Formosa to make clear America's objective of protecting her allies. After six months in this area she returned home on 19 February 1954. In September, she was deployed to the Western Pacific at a time when the Chinese Communists were stirring trouble in the South China Sea. During the next three months she engaged in hunter-killer operations off Japan and had patrol duty in the South China Sea. In late January 1955, Hollister accompanied the 7th Fleet in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalists from the Tachen Islands. Constant aerial coverage from this powerful carrier force enabled the Nationalists to move from an untenable position. This was considered by some as \"the most forthright U.S. action against communism since the Korean War.\" She returned to San Diego on 13 March for local operations.\n\nAnother deployment to the Far East from 27 September 1955 to 11 March 1956, saw Hollister resume her important peace keeping operations in this explosive area. Only six months passed before departing on another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, this time visiting Samoa, New Zealand, Manus, and Guam en route to the South China Sea. In January and February 1957, she operated with the Formosa Patrol and conducted training out of Japan before returning to San Diego 24 March.\n\nHollister deployed on 25 October on her ninth Western Pacific tour. In the early months of 1958 she operated with units of the 7th Fleet on Formosa Patrol. Units in this area were placed on alert as a crisis in Indonesia threatened the existing government. The presence of U.S. seapower exerted a powerful influence; the crisis subsided. The destroyer returned to San Diego 23 April but sailed again for the Western Pacific on 18 December to operate with the 7th Fleet. Returning San Diego on 13 June 1959, Hollister spent the remainder of the year engaged in tactical exercises out of San Diego.\n\nHollister departed on 6 February 1960 for her 11th Western Pacific deployment and began patrol duty in the Formosa Straits. This tour of duty also saw her engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises with the Philippine Navy. She returned to San Diego on 14 June to resume training and readiness operations.\n\nHollister entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 March 1961 for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul, remaining there through the end of the year for an addition of a helicopter deck and hangar aft. After refresher training, she departed Long Beach, California on 7 June 1962 for duty with the 7th Fleet. This cruise came after the Laos crisis and Communist insurgency threatened Thailand.\n\nShe remained in the Far East until 21 December 1962 when she returned to Long Beach. During 1963 Hollister engaged in shore bombardment exercises and antisubmarine training off the coast of California and in Hawaii water.\n\nIn the first half of 1964, Hollister engaged in antisubmarine exercises on the American West Coast. On 19 June, she departed Long Beach, California, with an antisubmarine group bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 June. After passage to Japan, she took up a station for contingency operations in the South China Sea on 4 August, and received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her patrol services off Vietnam. After continuing these operations intermittently until 17 November, Hollister began transit from Yokosuka, Japan, to Long Beach on 23 December, arriving on 6 January 1965.\n\nWith three months of overhaul complete, the ship engaged in continuous training exercises from 28 May to 20 August. Deploying again to the western Pacific in August, Hollister was ordered to Taiwan Patrol duty on 14 September.\n\nVietnam War \nBy 22 September, she returned to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, to commence plane guard and anti-submarine screen duties supporting . Hollister accompanied the aircraft carrier on \"Yankee Station\" off Vietnam, giving valuable support to the naval operations exercised in opposing the North Vietnamese Communists.\n\nOn 19 December she left the station and arrived in Yokosuka on 30 December, prior to her departure for the United States the following day.\n\nAfter a six-month repair and training period, Hollister left Long Beach on 25 June for the Far East once again. Arriving on 15 July, she screened carriers and prevented infiltration of supplies to the Viet Cong. Hollister remained in the Far East, where she was on station in May 1967.\n\nAfter completing a Fleet in-depth overhaul in 1972, Hollister again departed Homeport, this time for her eighteenth deployment to the Western Pacific, carrying a new missile configuration. On 10 August 1972 Hollister became the first U.S. Naval Vessel to ever fire a Surface-to-Surface missile in anger. The missile silenced a North Vietnam Radar site. Only a day before, while on a three ship daylight raid on the Quang Yien storage complex, Hollister received at least 250 rounds of hostile fire. The Task unit destroyed a huge ammunition cache with Hollister returning 193 rounds of fire against enemy shore batteries on the heavily fortified island of Hon Me. This was considered the most daring Destroyer operation of the Vietnam War. The target was destroyed and the Task Unit retired without damage or a single casualty.\n\nHollister returned from the Western Pacific for the last time in February 1973. Hollister's record included completing 21 Western Pacific deployments and action in two major conflicts.\n\nIn September 1973 \"Hollister\" was entered into the Reserve Fleet unit Desron 27, NAVSUPACT, Long Beach, California, with four other ships, the USS McKean DD784, USS Higbee DD806, USS DeHaven DD727 and the USS Henderson DD785. She operated as a training vessel for approximately 124 Naval Reservists. She had an active duty crew of approximately 212. During her reserve assignment she maintained high standards of preparedness to meet any assignment to which she was called.\n\nHollister was decommissioned in September 1979. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1979.\n\nOn 3 March 1983, Hollister was transferred to the Republic of China.\n\nService in the Republic of China Navy \nShe was commissioned on 15 November 1984 in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS Shao Yang (DD-929).\n\nOn 1 September 1988, Hui Yang was training in the open sea of Zuoying, and her shells on board the ship jammed. She was advised not enter the Zuoying Naval Base as her jammed shells pose a danger to the dangerous goods but she did moored in the base despite the warning. On the next day, 2 September, there was a non-commissioned officer whom fired her gun by mistake, and the shell directly penetrated the bridge of Shao Yang, killing 2 non-commissioned officers on the spot. The shells finally landed in the storage room of a family member's village. After these two deaths, the weapon commander, gunners and sergeants of the ship were sent to court martial, and an award from Colonel Lei Guangshu was also stripped.\n\nOn 26 December 1990, she underwent the Wu-Chin III modernization.\n\nIn June 2002, the case of leaking secrets by Liu Yuelong on the ship broke out and Liu was later sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nShe was scheduled for decommissioning on 1 June 2004 at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After the ship was decommissioned, she was temporarily berthed at the No. 4 Shipyard of the Qijin Navy Base in Kaohsiung Port to undergo disassembly for usable materials.\n\nIn mid-June 2006, she served as a target ship for the Han Kuang 22 exercise for naval and air force training, and berthed at the Suao Zhongzheng base. After the exercise of Hanguang 22, the ship was towed back to Qijinhai No. 4 Shipyard.\n\nShe was towed out to sea to be sunk as an artificial reef.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n hazegray.org: USS Hollister\n\nGearing-class destroyers of the United States Navy\nShips built in Seattle\n1945 ships\nMaritime incidents in 2006\nWorld War II destroyers of the United States\nCold War destroyers of the United States\nKorean War destroyers of the United States\nVietnam War destroyers of the United States\nUnited States Navy South Dakota-related ships\nChao Yang-class destroyers\nShips sunk as artificial reefs", "machine_text": " USS Hollister (DD-788) was a Gato-class submarine chaser of the United States Navy, built at the beginning of World War II.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"SAFA programme\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\n\nHistorical overview \n\nThe SAFA Programme was initially launched by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) in 1996. The Programme was not based upon a European legal binding basis, but upon a commitment of the Directors General of the participating ECAC Member States. The scope of the inspections performed on ‘foreign’ aircraft involved those aircraft which were not used or operated under the control of the inspecting competent authority.\n\nOn 30 April 2004, the Directive 2004/36/CE of the European Parliament and of the council on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports (the so-called 'SAFA Directive') was published, creating a legal obligation upon EU Member States to perform ramp inspections on third country aircraft landing at their airports, where ‘third country aircraft’ implied aircraft not used or operated under control of a competent authority of an EU Member State. Nevertheless, the Directive didn't prohibit in any way EU Member States from inspecting aircraft from other EU Member States. EU Member States were provided with a transition period of two years for transposing and implementing the above-mentioned Directive.\n\nUntil 2006, the operational elements of the SAFA Programme were implemented by the Central Joint Aviation Authorities (CJAA). At the end of 2006, the SAFA coordination activities, including the centralised database, have been transferred from CJAA to EASA.\n\nAs of 1 January 2007, following a decision by the Directors General of ECAC Member States, the SAFA Programme was transferred under European Community (EC) competence and the responsibility for the management and further development of the EU SAFA Programme falls upon the European Commission assisted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\nThe continued participation of the 15 non-EU ECAC Member States, and thus the pan-European dimension of the programme, has been assured through the signature of Working Arrangements between each of these individual States and EASA.\n\nIn the last 4 years, similar Working Arrangements have been signed with several non-European States (Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Singapore and Israel) and a further non-EU ECAC Member State (Montenegro).\n\nOn 28 October 2012, the Implementing Rules on Air Operations entered into force as the new legal basis for the EU ramp inspection programme, replacing the original system established by the SAFA Directive and its implementing regulations with a new system represented by the new EU Ramp Inspections Programme.\n\nThe EU Ramp Inspection Programme is a European Programme regarding the performance of ramp inspections on aircraft used by third country operators (SAFA) or used by operators under the regulatory oversight of another EU Member State (SACA).\n\nThe Programme is regulated by Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 and it provides for the inspection of aircraft suspected (based on e.g. safety relevant information collected by the Participating States or on regular analysis of the centralised database performed by EASA) of non-compliance with the applicable requirements (either international safety standards or EU standards). Ramp inspections may also be carried out in the absence of any suspicion, in this case a spot-check procedure is being used.\n\nThe applicable legal framework of the Programme contains the following:\n Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012;\n Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM) to Part-ARO, consolidated version, issue 3, 28 July 2014; and\n Inspection Instructions on the Categorisation of Ramp Inspection (SAFA/SACA) Findings – INST.RI.01/002 approved on 18 November 2015.\nThe EU Ramp Inspection Programme has replaced the EU SAFA Programme and has two major components:\n SAFA ramp inspections (for third country operators); and\n SACA ramp inspections (for community operators – checked against EU standards).\nIn each Participating State, aircraft of operators under the safety oversight of another Member State or of a third country can be subject to a ramp inspection, chiefly concerned with the aircraft documents and manuals, flight crew licenses, the apparent condition of the aircraft and the presence and condition of mandatory cabin safety equipment. The applicable requirements for these inspections are:\n The ICAO international standards for aircraft used by third country operators;\n The relevant EU requirements for aircraft used by operators under the regulatory oversight of another Member State;\n Manufacturers’ standards when checking the technical condition of the aircraft; and\n Published national standards (e.g. Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs)) that are declared applicable to all operators flying to that State.\nThese checks are carried out in accordance with a procedure which is common to all the Participating States. Their outcome is then subject to reports which also follow a common format.\n\nIn case of significant irregularities, the operator and the appropriate Aviation Authority (State of Operator or State of Registry) are contacted in order to arrive at corrective measures to be taken not only with regard to the aircraft inspected, but also with regard to other aircraft which could be concerned in the case of an irregularity which is of a generic nature. All data from the reports as well as supplementary information are shared and centralised in a computerised database set up and managed by EASA.\n\nThe main features of the EU Ramp Inspection Programme can be summarised as follows:\n its application by all Participating States – notably all ECAC States (EU Member States, non-EU ECAC States as well as non-EU States that have signed the EASA Working Arrangements);\n the broad dissemination of inspection results through a centralised database;\n its bottom-up approach: the programme is built around ramp inspections of aircraft;\n non-discriminatory approach: obligation for the participating EU Member States, that in addition to third country aircraft, to inspect EU aircraft as well, on the basis of the EU requirements;\nThe 47 Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, ramp inspections are limited to on-the-spot assessments and cannot substitute for proper regulatory oversight, thus, they cannot guarantee the airworthiness of a particular aircraft. Where irregularities have an immediate impact on safety, inspectors can demand corrective actions before they allow the aircraft to leave.\n\nStakeholders \nThe European Commission and Participating States are informed of any potentially safety hazards identified. They come together with EASA and Eurocontrol regularly in the Air Safety Committee meetings (ASC) and the Ramp Inspections Coordination and Standardisation (RICS) meetings. As of 2010, EASA is also organising yearly the Industry & Regulators Forum in Cologne, whereby states and aviation industry representatives meet to discuss issues of common interest in the ramp inspections area.\n\nEASA’s role in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme \nEASA is responsible for coordinating the RAMP inspections programme. The specific role and responsibilities of EASA in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are:\n to collect by means of a centralised database the inspection reports of the Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme;\n to develop, maintain and continuously update the centralised database;\n to provide necessary changes and enhancements to the database application;\n analyse all relevant information concerning the safety of aircraft and its operators;\n to report potential aviation safety problems to European Commission and all the Participating States;\n to advise the European Commission and all the Participating States on follow-up actions;\n to propose coordinated actions to the commission and to the competent authorities, when necessary on safety grounds, and ensure coordination at the technical level of such actions;\n to liaise with other European institutions and bodies, international organisations and third country competent authorities on information exchange.\n\nNational Coordinators \nNational coordinators have been appointed by the competent authorities of all the Participating States. The main role of a national coordinator is to ensure the day-today coordination of the programme at national level in order to facilitate the appropriate implementation of the programme.\n\nThe specific tasks of  a national coordinator should include the following:\n entering ramp inspection reports into the centralised database;\n prioritising ramp inspections in accordance with the applicable provisions;\n nominating national representatives for the ramp inspection working groups;\n acting as a focal point for the training schedules (initial and recurrent training) for all involved national ramp inspection staff;\n ensuring that all staff involved in ramp inspections are properly trained and scheduled for recurrent training;\n representing the Member State at the meetings of the Ramp Inspections Coordination and Standardisation group (RICS) on ramp inspections;\n promoting and implementing the inspector exchange programme;\n providing support in handling requests for disclosure of data;\n ensuring distribution of new legislation and latest versions of procedures to ramp inspection staff;\n organising regular meetings with all ramp inspection staff to maintain a high quality standard;\n implementing a national ramp inspection quality control system;\n managing the access of national operators and the competent authority's staff to the centralised database;\n act as a sectorial focal point in the domain of ramp inspections in the context of standardisation activities performed by the Agency;\n proposing appropriate team members for ramp inspection standardisation visits;\n provide information to the Agency, the Commission and the Member States on contacts with authorities and operators.\n\nMember States \n\nThe 47 Participating States engaged in the EU Ramp Inspections Programme are: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.\n\nSee also \n\n European Aviation Safety Agency\n European Civil Aviation Conference\n Joint Aviation Authorities\n List of air carriers banned in the EU\n\nExternal links \n https://www.easa.europa.eu/easa-and-you/air-operations/ramp-inspection-programmes-safa-saca\n\nAviation in Europe\nAviation safety", "machine_text": " SAFA programme The SAFA programme was a short-lived initiative in the early 1980s by the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to improve the UK's economic performance through a combination of macroeconomic management and microeconomic reform. The name was a pun on the word \"safa\", which is an acronym for \"stable, affordable, flexible, and above all, free\". Thatcher's government had already implemented a number of reforms to improve the UK's economic performance, including deregulation of the financial sector, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and reduction of the role of the state in the economy. The SAFA programme was intended to be the next phase of this process. The programme was launched in 1983, with the publication of a white paper entitled \"The SAFA Programme: A New Approach to Industrial Strategy\". The paper outlined a number of measures that the government would take to improve the UK's economic performance, including further deregulation, privatisation, and reform of the labour market. However, the SAFA programme was not a success, and was quickly abandoned by the government. The main reason for this was that the programme was seen as being too radical and disruptive to the UK's economy. The government's focus soon shifted to other areas, such as reducing inflation and improving the UK's competitiveness in the global economy.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 6142989}

Stavros K. Frangos, author of Greeks in Michigan, stated \"From the 1890s to the present all available sources agree that\" about one third of Michigan's Greek Americans live in Metro Detroit.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century the first Greek immigrants arrived. The first year of entry was 1886. Theodore Gerasimos was the first documented Greek immigrant. Detroit's Greeks began working in automobile factories and railroads, and some others became merchants; many merchants lived above or near their stores. Very few Greeks became farmers in the United States, even though many had backgrounds in agriculture. The first Greek settlement in Detroit was between St. Antoine and Beaubien on Monroe Street. The Greeks later moved to Macomb Street. In the beginning of the year 1900 the city's first Greek coffeeshop opened on 40 Macomb Street.\n\nThere were 250 Greeks in Detroit in 1909. In 1912 persecution of Greeks began, prompting immigration from Greece. The period 1911 to 1917 was the peak immigration period from Greece. In 1914 there were up to 8,000 Greeks in the city. In 1914 a wave of immigration from Greece came because Henry Ford offered his $5 per day jobs. The Greek population rose to 10,000 to 15,000 by 1930.\n\nPeloponnesus was the source of most Greek immigration to Detroit. Frangos wrote that \"While no other reliable statistics are available, certainly Greeks from the three islands of Chios, Crete, and Cyprus have always made up a sizeable element of the community.\" The National Centre of Social Research in Athens, by 1972, estimated that the State of Michigan had ethnic 100,000 Greeks. In 1999 The Detroit News stated that the Greeks were \"well-assimilated.\" By 2012 Detroit's Greeks moved to suburban communities. Suburbs with Greek Americans include Lincoln Park and St. Clair Shores.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically many Greek immigrants operated Coney islands, or restaurants serving Detroit Coney dogs. In the 1960s and early 1970s Greek immigrants established the Coney chains Kerby's Coney Island, Leo's Coney Island, and National Coney Island. All three chains sell some Greek food items with Coney dogs.  A previous Greek-established restaurant, Onassis Coney Island, closed.\n\nGeography\nThe Greek ethnic enclave of Greektown is still active. Because of the Greek immigration, within Michigan the most academic studies on Greek people are conducted in Detroit.\n\nMedia\nAs of 1951 the Greek newspapers published in Metro Detroit included Detroit Athens (Athenai), Greek Tribune, and Michigan AHEPAN. In addition the Californian, a newspaper published in California, and the Chicago-based Greek Star, Greek Press of Chicago, and the National Herald and Atlantis were other Greek newspapers distributed in Metro Detroit.\n\nEducation\nA.H.E.P.A. rented middle school classrooms and church rooms to conduct Greek language classes.\n\nNotable residents\n Louis Perentis - He was a merchant who one of the first Greeks to arrive in Detroit.

The first Greek immigrants to Detroit settled in the city's Greektown, a neighborhood that was one of the first established Greek communities in the United States. Greek immigration to Detroit would increase during the 1920s, and the city's Greek population would reach 16,000 by 1930. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Greeks in Detroit became successful business owners and professionals. Several Greeks in Detroit also rose to prominence in the city's political scene, and contributed to the city's politics and government, including former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and former Michigan Lieutenant Governor John Cherry. In the 1960s and 1970s, a large Greek community also developed in the nearby suburb of Oak Park. In the 1980s and 1990s, many young Greeks in Detroit became involved in the city's music scene, including the heavy metal band Metallica. Today, the Greek community in Detroit remains one of the largest and most vibrant in the United States, and the city's Greektown neighborhood is a major tourist and business destination. Places of Interest Greektown Greektown is a historic neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan, located in the city's downtown area along Monroe Avenue between Campus Martius Park and the Detroit River. The neighborhood is known for its Greek restaurants, bakeries, and merchants, as well as for the annual St. Greek Orthodox Church feast. The church, built in 1925, is the oldest standing church in Detroit. In the early 20th century, Greek immigrants began settling in Detroit's Greektown neighborhood, and the area soon became the city's primary Greek community. The neighborhood was one of the first established Greek communities in the United States, and its residents would go on to establish many of the city's Greek restaurants and businesses. Today, Greektown is a major tourist destination and business hub in Detroit, and is home to many of the city's Greek restaurants, bakeries, and merchants. The neighborhood is also the site of the annual St. Greek Orthodox Church feast, which attracts thousands of visitors each year. Metropolitan Detroit The Metropolitan Detroit area, which includes Detroit and its surrounding suburbs, has one of the largest and most vibrant Greek communities in the United States. The area's Greek population is estimated to be over 200,000, and is one of the fastest-growing Greek communities in the country. The Detroit area's Greek community is spread out across a number of neighborhoods and suburbs, including Detroit, Dearborn, Southfield, Oak Park, and Royal Oak. The Greektown neighborhood in downtown Detroit is the largest and most well-known Greek community in the region, and is home to many of the area's Greek restaurants, bakeries, and merchants. The metropolitan Detroit area is also home to a number of Greek-owned businesses, including the country's largest Greek-owned bank, the National Bank of Detroit.

It is on the China—Kyrgyzstan—Kazakhstan tripoint, east of lake Issyk Kul.  Its geologic elevation is , but its glacial icecap rises to . For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the Soviet Snow Leopard award criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak.\n\nKhan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by Jengish Chokusu (means \"Victory peak\", formerly known as Peak Pobeda) (7,439 m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in Kazakhstan and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after Jengish Chokusu (7,439  m) and Avicenna Peak (7,134 m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air.\n\nNames\nThe name \"Khan Tengri\" literally means \"King Heaven\" in Kazakh or \"King Sky\" in Mongolian and possibly references the deity Tengri. In some other local languages, it is known as Khan Tangiri Shyngy, Kan-Too Chokusu, Pik Khan-Tengry, and Hantengri Feng. (, , Han Táńiri, حان تأڭئرئ;  Han-Teñiri, حان-تەڭىرى; ; , Xiao'erjing: هًا تٍْ قْ لِ فعْ). Local residents named the mountain Khan-Tengri for the unique beauty of snow giants.\n\nFeatures\nKhan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the name \"blood mountain\" in Kazakh and Kyrgyz (; ). Located just across the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, 16 km north of Jengish Chokusu, Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapaev Peak () and Gorky Peak (). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.\n\nHistory\nAlthough it is almost 430 m (1,500 ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.\n\nPeter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).\n\nThe first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by ’s Ukrainian team through a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious Snow Leopard award.\n\nAnatoli Boukreev achieved the first solo speed ascent in 1990.\n\nA team from Kazakhstan made the first winter ascent of Khan Tengri on February 7, 1992; the team included Valery Khrichtchatyi, Viktor Dedi, Yuri Moiseyev, Valdimir Suviga, Aleksandr Savin, Igor Putintsev and Malik Ismetov.\n\nAustrian mountaineer and expedition leader Toni Dürnberger died while descending after having climbed Khan Tengri on 17 August 1992.\n\nIn 2004, more than a dozen mountaineers were killed in a large avalanche on the Pogrebetsky route, the most popular route on the mountain.\n\nThe peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 som bill.\n\nSee also \n\n List of elevation extremes by country\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Khan Tengri route maps\n International Mountaineering Camp Kan Tengri\n\nMountains of China\nMountains of Kazakhstan\nMountains of Kyrgyzstan\nIssyk-Kul Region\nLandforms of Almaty Region\nKazakhstan–Kyrgyzstan border\nInternational mountains of Asia\nSeven-thousanders of the Tian Shan\nChina–Kazakhstan border\nChina–Kyrgyzstan border\nBorder tripoints\nHighest points of countries\nTengriism", "machine_text": " Khan Tengri is a mountain in the Khövsgöl Province of Mongolia near the border with Russia.

With an elevation of 6,995 metres (22,905 feet), it is the second-highest mountain in Mongolia, after Bayan Khongor. The Khan Tengri is notable for its massive bulk and its jagged peaks. It is a very difficult climb due to the steepness and the technical difficulty of the routes. The mountain and its surrounding area are part of the Khan Tengri Nature Reserve. In the Soviet era, the mountain was considered to be \"secret\" due to its location in Mongolia, then a closed country.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hohenfels-Essingen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Hohenfels-Essingen is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nGeography \n\nThe municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588 m), the Alter Voß (588 m, with “Liberation Beech”) and the Mühlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).\n\nHistory \nAs witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.\n\nRomans and Franks \nIn the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier.\n\nIn the district Im Keller (“In the Cellar”) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.\n\nThe great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the “army kings’” (Heerkönige) hands. The people who had lived here until now – Romanized Celts and Romans – either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.\n\n15th to 17th centuries \nEven before the Thirty Years' War, the Mühlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain’s south slope.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the Mühlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.\n\n18th and 19th centuries \nAs a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one.\n\nIn November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat  in Düsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War.\n\nIn 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit – the Feuerberg in Hohenfels – was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.\n\n20th century to present \n\nAfter the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland.\n\nIn the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the Mühlenberg. In the area around Hohenfels, a firm from Mayen was making runner stones and shipping them worldwide. In 1928 above the cadastral area of “Wahlend”, a gravelworks was built, remaining in operation until 1974. For a time, more than 100 people were employed here.\n\nIn the course of administrative reform, the two self-administering municipalities of Hohenfels and Essingen were merged on 1 January 1968 into a single municipality.\n\nPolitics\n\nMunicipal council \nThe council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nCoat of arms \nThe German blazon reads: In Silber ein schräglinkes, rotes Schwert, begleitet oben von einer blauen Urne, unten von einem grünen Mühlstein.\n\nThe municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a sword bendwise sinister gules, the point to chief, between an urn azure and a millstone vert.\n\nThe red sword stands for the execution place of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun between Hohenfels and Essingen on the old Roman road, marked on the map of the Amt of Daun in 1683 with a gallows symbol. The blue urn refers to the great Frankish burying ground with 125 graves and the important finds therefrom. The green millstone refers to the Hohenfels millstone quarry, already widely known in the Middle Ages, and further for the landscape in both constituent centres, which is characterized by volcanism, and where there is even today lava and basalt quarrying.\n\nCulture and sightseeing \n The grotto at the Mühlenberg\n Millstone caves\n Basalt deposits\n Hiking trails\n\nBuildings\n\nEssingen \n Saint Hubert’s Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Hubertus), Bergstraße 10, biaxial aisleless church, 1886.\n Bergstraße 1 – Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), from 1783, old cobbles in yard.\n Bergstraße 2 – house from 1816, commercial building, some old cobbles in yard, whole complex.\n Wayside cross, southwest of the village on the road to Rockeskyll, cast-iron crucifix, about 1900.\n Wayside cross, west of the village at a hairpin bend in the road, a basalt beam cross from 1749 (?).\n\nHohenfels \n Catholic church, Gerolsteiner Straße 6, four-axis Gothic Revival aisleless church from 1894.\n Before Am Mühlenberg 6 – wayside cross, basalt shaft cross from 1687.\n Schulstraße, graveyard, warriors’ memorial 1914–1918, Crucifixion group, praying soldier, from 1922.\n Wayside cross, north of the village at the Mühlenberg at the lower hairpin bend, basalt shaft cross from 1719.\n\nClubs \n Freizeit- und Sportverein Hohenfels-Essingen e.V.

He was born in Bavaria, Germany, and immigrated to the United States in 1938. He is best known for his large canvas paintings and highly detailed lithographs that were inspired by calligraphic writing. Wilke was deeply intrigued by the written language, and much of his work was derived from his abstract interpretation of the shapes, colors and meanings of writing that he found in all languages and forms, including the poetry and ancient engravings of Asia and the Middle East. He was an avid art collector, particularly of tribal art, and was the founding director of the University of Iowa Museum of Art.\n\nWilke studied art at Harvard on a Carnegie scholarship before being drafted into the US Army in 1942. In 1947, he completed his master's degree in Art at the University of Iowa. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Wilke was an art teacher and director at several universities and museums. He received the Guggenheim Fellowship twice (in 1959 and 1960), which he used to travel to work and study first in Munich and Rome, and later Kyoto, Japan where he lived in monastery and studied Japanese Zen calligraphy under the monks.\n\nWilke returned to the US in the 1960s. He lived in New York City at this time and worked as a professor at Rutgers University. This period defined Wilke as an artist, and it was during this time that he became connected to the great New York school of artists of the 1950s and 1960s. He maintained close relationships with many famed artist colleagues including Ad Reinhardt, Julius Bissier, George Rickey, Mark Rothko, Lyonel Feininger, Max Beckmann, Mark Tobey, Kenzo Okada, Robert Motherwell and David Smith.\n\nIn 1968, Wilke's reputation as an art collector earned him a position as founding director of the University of Iowa Art Museum. He served as museum director there until relocating to Hawaii in 1978.\n\nWilke had many solo exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally, and was awarded many honors, including an exhibition and award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. A few of the museums holding Wilke’s work in their collections today include the Solomon R.

He went on to earn a Bachelor of Music degree from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1930, and a Master of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1932. That same year he began teaching at his alma mater, the Philadelphia Conservatory, where he would serve on the faculty for the next three decades. In 1938, he became the head of the institution's composition department, and in 1956 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Music. Among his notable students were Henry retailing, Jr., James Wilson, and Richard Wernick. In 1968, the school was renamed the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, and it is now part of the University of the Arts. Although best known for his teaching, Wilke was also a prolific composer, with over 100 works to his name. His compositions include a piano concerto commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra for the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Academy of Music, a violin concerto commissioned by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for its 50th anniversary, a piano quartet commissioned by the Curtis Institute for the 90th anniversary of its founding, a wind ensemble suite commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, and a variety of works for chorus and orchestra, band, piano, violin, and other instruments. His music is characterized by its accessibility to audiences and performers alike, and by its employment of modern classical idioms and techniques. In addition to his composing and teaching, Wilke was active as a conductor, appearing with such ensembles as the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, and the Curtis Institute of Music Symphony Orchestra. He also led the Efrem Zimbalist Symphony Orchestra at the Curtis Institute, and was the founding conductor of the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts Symphony Orchestra.

Without the Fishbein convention, the usual way to counter it is to double the bid requesting partner to bid his strongest suit (i.e. a takeout double) or to bid notrumps to play.  The disadvantage of this approach is that a  of a weak opponent might be very profitable, and redefining the double as takeout would make this weapon unavailable. Fishbein's solution was to leave the double for penalties and, by convention, to bid the next suit up from that bid by the opening preemptor to ask for a takeout; the conventional bid can only be made by the opener's Left Hand Opponent (LHO). For example, if opener bids 3, LHO would bid 3 for takeout.  Over 3 LHO would bid 4; double would be for penalty and 3NT to play.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nBridge conventions", "machine_text": " Fishbein convention The Fishbein convention is a bidding convention in the game of bridge, used to force a reply by the partner of the player who has opened the bidding. It is used when the player to the left of the opener has already bid, and the opener's partner wishes to force the opener to bid again. It is named after its inventor, Milton Fishbein. After the opponent of the opener has made a bid, the partner of the opener may make a bid, known as a Fishbein bid, of two notrump, two clubs or two diamonds. This bid forces the opener to rebid, but does not necessarily force the opponent to bid again. The partner's bid may be higher than two notrump, two clubs or two diamonds, but it then becomes a conventional bid and the opener is not forced to rebid. The Fishbein convention is used only in Acol bridge, where it is an extension of the weak notrump convention. In other systems it is not used, as the opener's partner can instead make a pre-emptive bid of three notrump, three clubs or three diamonds, which are natural but not as powerful as the Fishbein bids. The advantage of using the Fishbein convention is that the opener's partner can make a powerful bid that is not normally available. For example, after 1 - 2NT - 3NT, a bid of 4 is a Fishbein bid, and forces the opener to rebid, providing information to the partner. Without the Fishbein convention, the partner would have to bid 4 , which is not a pre-emptive bid and does not force a reply.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 21873350}

From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).\n\nHistory \n\nShortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.\n\nA Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964–1968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.\n\nIn July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the  (FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.\n\nIn July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974–75 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 Aérospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.\n\nThe Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called \"special missions\", consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.\n\nIn the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. The  at Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.\n\nThe extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.\n\nThe FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.\n\nCurrent structure \nAs of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.\n\nLike the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.\n\nKnown chiefs of staff\nMajor General Faustin Munene in 1997\nBrigadier General Jean Bitanihirwa Kamara in 2005\nMajor General Djedje Ndamba in 2006\nMajor General John Numbi in 2007\nMajor General Rigobert Massamba Musungu from 2007\nBrigadier General (Major General from July 2018) Numbi Ngoie Enoch since 2014\n\nAircraft \nAccording to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.\nJane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.\nThe DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi.

It was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the UK's main agency for funding research in engineering and the physical sciences, from 2002 to 2006. The aims of the project were to: * Design, build and evaluate a digital transcription system for the recognition of broad phonetic categories in speech, using hand-transcribed training data from the first two years of child language; * Investigate the effect of background noise and different accents on the performance of such a system, using both simulated and real data; * Develop a general framework for the evaluation of transcription systems which can be applied to a wide range of tasks and test data sets. The system was based on the pronunciation of phonetic categories, rather than the more sophisticated approach of phoneme-based systems. The main reason for this was that the data available for training and testing was very limited, consisting of just two years of child language data. The decision to focus on phonetic categories was also driven by the developers' hypothesis that this would be a more robust approach, since it would be more tolerant of variation in pronunciation. The system was evaluated using a combination of automated and human tests. The automated tests used a set of metrics developed by the LTC, which were designed to be applicable to a wide range of transcription tasks. The human tests involved transcribing a set of utterances which were randomly selected from the training data, and then comparing the results with the original transcriptions. The project was successful, and the system achieved a recognition rate of over 80% on the test data. The results of the project were published in a series of papers in the journal Language Resources and Evaluation. The project also had a number of spin-off projects, including a collaboration with the BBC to develop a system for transcribing historical audio recordings, and a project to develop a speech recognition system for a virtual assistant.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11030270}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh,  (26 November 1937 – 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.\n\nMoore was particularly noted for his \"filmstar good looks\" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.\n\nMoore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as \"Mr Privatisation\". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.\n\nMoore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.\n\nEarly life\nMoore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.\n\nHe enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a \"precinct captain\". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.\n\nMoore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.\n\nIn October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being \"an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36\".\n\nEarly political career\nCroydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.\n\nMoore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife \"... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food....\" He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;\n\nHandsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.\n\nMargaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was \"youth\". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.\n\nAfter the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as \"Mr Privatisation\".\n\nCabinet career\nMoore joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.\n\n... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered \"sharp, nasty – and effective\".\n\nBy now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The journalist Brian Walden wrote \"... he has future Tory leader written all over him\". After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.\n\nHowever, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore's earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, \"The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines\". Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for \"a good-looking fellow\" when it came to making government appointments. \"Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job.\" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.\n\nOnce established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the USA in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.\n\nMoore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be \"a soft touch\". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being \"useless\". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: \"It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do\". Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore's wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.\n\nA 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.\n\nIn November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated \"How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?\".\n\nEnd of political career\nAfter two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.\n\nMoore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.\n\nHe was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.\n\nHe gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.\n\nAfter leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech. Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates.\n\nWhile he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed\n\nArms\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1937 births\n2019 deaths\nAlumni of the London School of Economics\nBritish Secretaries of State\nEnglish stockbrokers\nConservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies\nConservative Party (UK) life peers\nMembers of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom\nPeople educated at Licensed Victuallers' School\nPeople from Kentish Town\nPolitics of the London Borough of Croydon\nSecretaries of State for Transport (UK)\nUK MPs 1974\nUK MPs 1974–1979\nUK MPs 1979–1983\nUK MPs 1983–1987\nUK MPs 1987–1992\nSecretaries of State for Health and Social Services\n20th-century English businesspeople", "machine_text": " John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh was an English businessman, politician, and philanthropist. Born in Marylebone, London, the son of a leather factor, Moore was initially employed as a clerk by the London and County Banking Company, before becoming a partner in the firm of John Jones and Co., Factors and Commission Agents, and then setting up his own business as a commission agent, John Moore and Co., in 1842. In 1860, he took his brother, William, into partnership, and the firm was renamed John Moore and Brothers. The firm was a great success, and the business expanded to include estate agency, and, in 1889, it was floated on the London Stock Exchange as Moore and Sons, Limited. The firm was a large employer in the Marylebone area, and also had offices in Paris and Milan. In 1871, Moore bought the estate of Marylebone from the Duke of Portland for £250,000. In addition to his business interests, Moore was also a property developer, and the next twenty years saw the rapid development of the area, with many of the fine houses in the Portland Place and Wimpole Street areas being built during this period. Politically, Moore was a Liberal, and in 1880 he was elected as one of the first London County councillors for the Marylebone East division. In 1885, he was elected to the House of Commons as one of the two members for Marylebone West, and he held the seat until he was defeated in 1900. In 1898, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, in the County of London. Lord Moore was also a generous philanthropist, and gave large sums of money for the benefit of his employees and the local community. He provided a hospital and an infirmary for his staff, and also contributed towards the cost of building a new church in nearby St John's Wood, where many of his employees lived. He also funded the building of a large public hall in Marylebone, which was named after him. Lord Moore died in April 1911, aged 75.

Zeigler was a Whitehorse city councillor from 2005 to 2011, and was the Yukon vice-chair of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency from 2007 to 2011. In the 2011 election, Zeigler was elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly as a member of the Yukon Party.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Internet Brands\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "MH Sub I, LLC dba Internet Brands is an American new media company based in El Segundo, California, United States, that operates online media, community, and e-commerce sites in vertical markets. The company also develops and licenses internet software and social media applications.\n\nBusinesses\nThe company operates two divisions: consumer internet and licensing.\n\nConsumer Internet division\nThe consumer internet division owns and operates more than 95 websites in seven categories.  The company attracts more than 62 million unique visitors per month, with 97% of the audience originating from organic, non-paid sources.  The company's strategy is to focus on specific target audiences that tend to be attractive to advertisers.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Internet Brands acquired AllLaw.com and AttorneyLocate.com, both founded by Arvind A. Raichur.\n\nSEC filings indicate that approximately 70% of the company's revenues are derived from advertising from more than 40,000 accounts—most of them small and medium enterprises.\n\nThe company's portfolio of websites include many with social media features: social network services, user generated content, blogs, wikis, and internet forums.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1998 as  CarsDirect.com, launched from the business incubator Idealab.  The company invented a consumer-advocacy approach to selling cars \"haggle-free\" online, an approach it continues to employ.  In 2000, Roger Penske invested in the company and joined the Board of Directors.  In 2002, Time Magazine voted the site one of the 50 best in the world.\n\nThe company changed its name to Internet Brands in 2005.  The company's IPO was in November 2007 on the NASDAQ exchange. INET was added to the NASDAQ Internet Index on March 22, 2010.\n\nInternet Brands agreed to be acquired for $640 million by the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman in September 2010 and was thus delisted from NASDAQ.\n\nIn September 2012, Internet Brands became involved in a legal battle with the Wikimedia Foundation (the operators of Wikipedia) over the future of Wikitravel's community.\n\nInternet Brands was acquired in June 2014 by KKR from Hellman & Friedman for 1.1 billion dollars. KKR is making its investment in partnership with Internet Brands chief executive officer Bob Brisco and the Internet Brands management team, who will hold a minority stake in the company and continue to run the business.\n\nIn January 2016, Intuit Inc. announced an agreement to sell Demandforce to Internet Brands.\n\nControversies\n\nvBulletin criticism\nIn October 2009, Internet Brands changed the pricing structure for its vBulletin software, prompting complaints from registered users on the official forums.  According to The Register those who complained were then banned from both the forums and from receiving support and updates, despite still having valid licences for the product.  Internet Brands defended their position to The Register in a separate article; however, a later update to the same article stated that at least some of Internet Brands' claims were false.\n\nvBulletin and XenForo\nIn October 2010, Internet Brands announced that it would file a lawsuit against the XenForo team claiming copyright infringement; specifically that code in XenForo was based on vBulletin code, breach of contract, and engaging in unfair business practices. In November 2010, Internet Brands sued Kier Darby, a lead developer of XenForo, who had previously served as a lead developer for Internet Brands' vBulletin, claiming that Kier had not returned confidential information from Internet Brands regarding the vBulletin software. The XenForo team has denied the claims.  In February 2013, the lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nWikitravel and Wikimedia\n\nIn 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction, community members at Internet Brands-owned website Wikitravel began discussing whether to fork (split off) of their work and editing activities from Wikitravel and recommence their editing activities at another website host. The dissatisfaction related to long standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive over-monetarization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.\n\nForking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is permitted by the Creative Commons license in use on sites such as Wikitravel, and the wiki software used by Wikitravel included the facility to take 'database \"dumps\"' for that purpose. This mirrored the fork of the German and Italian language Wikitravel communities some years earlier, which led to a new travel wiki site called Wikivoyage. Members of the communities concerned decided that the community at Wikitravel would move its editing efforts to merge with Wikivoyage, to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the owner of Wikipedia and a large range of other non-profit reference sites based upon a wiki community.\n\nThe merge and move were endorsed by the editing community, but opposed by Internet Brands who litigated against two users it accused of unlawful actions related to the proposal. The allegations were strongly rejected by the individuals and the (non-party) Wikimedia Foundation who stated the case was an example of a SLAPP lawsuit intended to deter and frustrate lawful conduct. On November 19, 2012, the claims by Internet Brands were dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nGreenlight Financial Services\nIn April 2013, on behalf of its client Greenlight Financial Services, Inc., the Rhema Law Group won a jury verdict trial against Internet Brands, Inc.  The Orange County Superior Court jury found that Internet Brands breached a previous settlement agreement between the parties and awarded lost profits damages in the amount of $750,000.\n\nModel Mayhem \nModelMayhem.com is a social media website where models can create profiles and publish pictures. In May 2008 Internet Brands bought Model Mayhem from the original developers Donald and Tyler Waitt. Model Mayhem was involved in the court case Jane Doe No. 14 v. Internet Brands, Inc., where litigants argued that Model Mayhem was liable for damages resulting from crimes committed by users on the website.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nMass media companies established in 1998\nAmerican companies established in 1998\nOnline mass media companies of the United States\nTechnology companies based in Greater Los Angeles\nCompanies based in El Segundo, California\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts companies\n1998 establishments in California\n2007 initial public offerings\nCompanies formerly listed on the Nasdaq\n2010 mergers and acquisitions\n2014 mergers and acquisitions", "machine_text": " Internet Brands, Inc. is an online media and e-commerce company based in El Segundo, California.

The lockout would be resolved on July 13 when an agreement was reached in principle.

In the NHL, the season was cut short by a lockout, as the players' association and the owners' lockout committee failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.

Although it is one of Georgia's smallest towns, Signagi serves as a popular tourist destination due to its location at the heart of Georgia's wine-growing regions, as well as its picturesque landscapes, pastel houses and narrow, cobblestone streets. Located on a steep hill, Signagi overlooks the vast Alazani Valley, with the Caucasus Mountains visible at a distance.\n\nEtymology \nThe name of the town comes from Old Turkic word of  (, ), meaning \"shelter\" or \"asylum\".\n\nHistory \nSignagi is located in the Kakheti region of Georgia, first settled in the Paleolithic period. Throughout its history, Signagi or Sighnaghi was known to the local population as Kambechovani, and later as Kisikhi or Kisiki. The word Sighnaghi in the Turkic language means shelter or trench. Signagi as a settlement was first recorded in the early 18th century. In 1762, King Heraclius II of Georgia sponsored the construction of the town and erected a fortress to defend the area from marauding attacks by Dagestani tribesmen.\n\nAccording to the 1770 census, 100 families, chiefly craftsmen and merchants, lived in Signagi. When Georgia was annexed by Imperial Russia in 1801, Signagi (Signakh) was officially granted town status and became a center of the Signakh uyezd () within the Tiflis Governorate in 1802. In 1812, Signakh joined the rebellion with the rest of Kakheti against Russian rule. During the Caucasian War, the town \"was considered an important point on account of its proximity to\" Dagestan.\n\nThe town quickly grew in size and population and became an agricultural center in the Soviet Union. The severe economic crisis in post-Soviet Georgia heavily affected the town, but a major reconstruction project recently launched by the Government of Georgia and co-funded by several international organizations intends to both address an increasing tourist interest and modernize infrastructure.\n\nGeography and Climate \nThe town has an area of 2.978 ha with 24.3% being residential. Signagi is approximately 113 km southeast of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Signagi District is adjacent, on the town’s east and southwest sides. Signagi is situated in the eastern foothills of the Gombori Range, a watershed between the Iori and Alazani valleys, in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. At an elevation of about 790 m above sea level, the town overlooks the Alazani Valley and faces the Greater Caucasus mountains.\n\nSignagi has a mild Mediterranean-like climate. There are four seasons, with winters being moderately cold while summers can be hot. The highest average temperature is in July at 24.3°C while the lowest average temperature is in January at 0.2°C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 602.1 to 949.7 mm, with the heaviest occurring during the spring months and early summer.\n\nCulture and Attractions \nSignagi and its environs are home to several historical and cultural monuments and have been specifically protected by the State since 1975. The town is walled with the remnants of 18th-century fortifications. There are two Georgian Orthodox churches in the town itself - one dedicated to St. George and the other to St. Stephen. The venerated Bodbe Monastery is located 2 kilometers from Signagi and is a place of pilgrimage due to its association with St. Nino, the 4th-century apostle of Georgia.\n\nThe local Ethnographic and Archaeological Museum dating from the 1950s was upgraded and developed into a modern-standard exhibition the – Signagi Museum – in 2007. Signagi is known as the \"City of Love\" in Georgia, with many couples visiting it just to get married.\n\nGallery\n\nNotable people\nGevorg Bashinjaghian, painter\nOtar Chiladze, writer\nTamaz Chiladze, writer\nVano Sarajishvili, singer\nBidzina Kvernadze, composer\n\nSee also\n Kakheti\n Vaqiri\nKingdom of Kartli-Kakheti\n\nReferences \n\nRosen, Roger.

It is the administrative center of the Signagi Municipality. The town is situated on a rocky promontory overlooking the Alazani Valley and the foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains to the north. The distance from Signagi to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, is about 100 km. The town is located at the intersection of the Sh16 and Sh18 highways and is a popular destination for tourists. Signagi is known for its picturesque landscapes and unique architecture. The old part of the town is surrounded by a defensive wall and is located on the steep hill that gives the town its unusual appearance. The famous Georgian writer and poet Alexander Chavchavadze lived in Signagi in the 19th century and contributed to the town's development.

Signagi is a settlement with a long history. It was a castle in the Middle Ages. The first mention of Signagi is in the 14th-century travel notes of an Italian tourist, who visited Georgia and described Signagi as a town with a defensive wall and a castle. The wall has been preserved to this day. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Signagi became a residence of the kings of Kakheti. In the 18th century, the town was attacked and burned by the Persian king Nader Shah. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in the 19th century, Signagi became a town.

It is located on the Port Madison Indian Reservation in Washington state and was founded in 1983. The museum currently occupies a facility opened in 2012.\n\nHistory\nThe Suquamish Museum opened in 1983 as the Suquamish Museum and Cultural Center, then only the second tribal museum in the state of Washington.  In 2009 the Suquamish tribe launched a capital campaign to construct a new facility, enlisting Senator Patty Murray and former Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro to help lead the effort. The new facility opened in 2012 and is triple the size of the original building. Constructed at a cost of $6 million, the  purpose-built structure is set in a small botanical garden on the Port Madison Indian Reservation and consists of two galleries, a gift shop, a 50-seat auditorium, and a climate-controlled storage room used to house artifacts not on display. The facility was designed by the Seattle architectural firm Mithun and is a LEED Gold certified building. In 2013 it received a citation from the Washington Council of the American Institute of Architects.\n\nOperations\n\nCollection\n\nIn addition to a large repository of photographs documenting tribal life from the 1860s to the present, the museum's collection includes 496 archaeological artifacts recovered from the site of the former Old Man House, a massive,  long longhouse that served as the Suquamish capitol until its destruction in the late nineteenth century. Originally in the custody of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington, the artifacts, which include harpoon points, smoking pipes, and jewelry, were transferred to the Suquamish tribe in 2013.  In 2014, the Port of Seattle transferred additional artifacts to the museum, including crockery and glass bottles, discovered during archaeological excavations in the 1970s at the Baba'kwob site, a pre-contact village located in what is now Seattle's Belltown neighborhood. The controversial transfer was contested by the Duwamish, an unrecognized tribe and historic Suquamish rival who claim ownership of the artifacts.\n\nExhibitions\nThe museum's main gallery features a permanent exhibit titled \"Ancient Shores – Changing Tides\" that showcases drawings, documents, and historic photographs related to the Suquamish Tribe, contemporary and historic crafts, and interpretative panels and multimedia elements. The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 300-year-old carved canoe that was last used in the 1989 Paddle to Seattle, the first of a now annual series of canoe journeys through the Salish Sea undertaken by tribal members.\nA second gallery is used to house rotating exhibits from the museum's permanent collection, or items on loan from other museums, including traveling exhibits from the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). Exhibits have included a SITES display \"Native Words, Native Warriors\", chronicling the history of Native Americans in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nManagement\nThe Suquamish Museum is governed by a five-member board of directors appointed by the Suquamish Tribal Council. The galleries and auditorium of the museum are open daily during the summer, and five days per week the rest of the year. The museum's storage vault is open to tribal members and accredited researchers weekly.\n\nReferences\n\nEthnic museums in Washington (state)\nCoast Salish museums in Washington (state)\nMuseums in Kitsap County, Washington\nMuseums established in 1983\n1983 establishments in Washington (state)", "machine_text": " Suquamish Museum The Suquamish Museum, located in Suquamish, Washington, was founded in 1980 by the Suquamish Tribal Council to preserve and interpret the history and culture of the Suquamish people, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"European mink\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the Russian mink and Eurasian mink, is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to Europe.\n\nIt is similar in colour to the American mink, but is slightly smaller and has a less specialized skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not closely related to the American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (kolonok). The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.\n\nThe European mink is listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered due to an ongoing reduction in numbers, having been calculated as declining more than 50% over the past three generations and expected to decline at a rate exceeding 80% over the next three generations. European mink numbers began to shrink during the 19th century, with the species rapidly becoming extinct in some parts of Central Europe. During the 20th century, mink numbers declined all throughout their range, the reasons for which having been hypothesised to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with (as well as diseases spread by) the introduced American mink, habitat destruction, declines in crayfish numbers and hybridisation with the European polecat. In Central Europe and Finland, the decline preceded the introduction of the American mink, having likely been due to the destruction of river ecosystems, while in Estonia, the decline seems to coincide with the spread of the American mink.\n\nEvolution and taxonomy\nFossil finds of the European mink are very rare, thus indicating the species is either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being closely related to the American mink, the European mink's closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization) and the Siberian weasel, being intermediate in form between true polecats and other members of the genus. The closeness between the mink and polecat is emphasized by the fact the species can hybridize.\n\nSubspecies\n, seven subspecies are recognised.\n\nDescription\n\nBuild\n\nThe European mink is a typical representative of the genus Mustela, having a greatly elongated body with short limbs. However, compared to its close relative, the Siberian weasel, the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink's tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal's body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink's skull is less elongated than the kolonok's, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the Siberian weasel and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialized for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure  in body length, while females measure . Tail length is  in males and . Overall weight is  . It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously.\n\nFur\n\nThe winter fur of the European mink is very thick and dense, but not long, and quite loosely fitting. The underfur is particularly dense compared with that of more land-based members of the genus Mustela. The guard hairs are quite coarse and lustrous, with very wide contour hairs which are flat in the middle, as is typical in aquatic mammals. The length of the hairs on the back and belly differ little, a further adaptation to the European mink's semiaquatic way of life. The summer fur is somewhat shorter, coarser and less dense than the winter fur, though the differences are much less than in purely terrestrial mustelids.\n\nIn dark coloured individuals, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown, while light individuals are reddish brown. Fur colour is evenly distributed over the whole body, though in a few cases, the belly is a bit lighter than the upper parts. In particularly dark individuals, a dark, broad dorsal belt is present. The limbs and tail are slightly darker than the trunk. The face has no colour pattern, though its upper and lower lips and chin are pure white. White markings may also occur on the lower surface of the neck and chest. Occasionally, colour mutations such as albinos and white spots throughout the pelage occur. The summer fur is somewhat lighter, and dirty in tone, with more reddish highlights.\n\nDifferences from American mink\nThe European mink is similar to the American mink, but with several important differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting than that of the European mink. Unlike the European mink, which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink's skull is much less specialised than the American species' in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The European mink is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.\n\nBehaviour\n\nTerritorial and denning behaviours\n\nThe European mink does not form large territories, possibly due to the abundance of food on the banks of small water bodies. The size of each territory varies according to the availability of food; in areas with water meadows with little food, the home range is , though it is more usual for territories to be . Summer territories are smaller than winter territories. Along shorelines, the length of a home range varies from , with a width of .\n\nThe European mink has both a permanent burrow and temporary shelters. The former is used all year except during floods, and is located no more than  from the water's edge. The construction of the burrow is not complex, often consisting of one or two passages  in diameter and  in length, leading to a nest chamber measuring . Nesting chambers are lined with straw, moss, mouse wool and bird feathers. It is more sedentary than the American mink, and will confine itself for long periods in its burrow in very cold weather.\n\nReproduction and development\nDuring the mating season, the sexual organs of the female enlarge greatly and become pinkish-lilac in colour, which is in contrast with the female American mink, whose organs do not change. In the Moscow Zoo, estrus was observed on 22–26 April, with copulation lasting from 15 minutes to an hour. The average litter consists of three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about , and grow rapidly, trebling their weight 10 days after birth. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30–31 days. The lactation period lasts 2.0 to 2.5 months, though the kits eat solid food after 20–25 days. They accompany the mother on hunting expeditions at the age of 56–70 days, and become independent at the age 70–84 days.\n\nDiet\nThe European mink has a diverse diet consisting largely of aquatic and riparian fauna. Differences between its diet and that of the American mink are small. Voles are the most important food source, closely followed by crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands, with cases being known of European minks catching fish weighing . The European mink's daily food requirement is . In times of food abundance, it caches its food.\n\nRange and status\nThe European mink is mostly restricted to Europe. Its range was widespread in the 19th century, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south. Over the last 150 years, though, it has severely declined by more than 90% and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range. The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia, the Danube Delta in Romania and northwestern Bulgaria). It occurs from sea level to . In Estonia, the European mink population has been successfully re-established on the island of Hiiumaa, and there are plans for repeating the process on the nearby island of Saaremaa.\n\nDecline\n\nThe earliest actual records of decreases in European mink numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct in several areas by the middle of the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s-1950s, the European mink became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the European mink was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978–79. The decline of the European mink in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of European mink numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the European mink was very common and widely distributed, with 8000–10,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the European mink was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s-1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the European mink has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range.\n\nPossible reasons for decline\n\nHabitat loss\nHabitat-related declines of European mink numbers may have started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the European mink is more dependent on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine has been linked to the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, European mink populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development.\n\nOverhunting\nThe European mink was historically hunted extensively, particularly in Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting to let the population recover. In the early 20th century, 40–60,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, with a record of 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global European mink population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany.\n\nDecline of crayfish\nThe decline of European crayfish has been proposed as a factor in the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in the eastern side of the Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with crayfish plague. The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution.\n\nCompetition with the American mink and disease\nThe American mink was introduced and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is less dependent on wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though the presence of the American mink has coincided with the decline of European mink numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the European mink in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining.\n\nDiseases spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Twenty-seven helminth species are recorded to infest the European mink, consisting of 14 trematodes, two cestodes and 11 nematodes. The mink is also vulnerable to pulmonary filariasis, krenzomatiasis and skrjabingylosis. In the Leningrad and Pskov Oblasts, 77.1% of European minks were found to be infected with skrjabingylosis.\n\nHybridisation and competition with the European polecat\n\nIn the early 20th century, northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with an expansion of the range of the European polecat. The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation. Also, competition with the polecat has greatly increased, due to landscape change favouring the polecat. There is one record of a polecat attacking a mink and dragging it to its burrow.\n\nPolecat-mink hybrids are termed khor'-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. Fairly large, the males attain the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing  and measuring  in length), and females are much larger than female European minks (weighing  and measuring  in length). The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile. The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate the hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid's larger size (especially the male's) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diet of wild polecat-mink hybrids is more similar to that of the mink than to the polecat, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as the polecat does.\n\nPredation\nPredators of the European mink include the European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls and the red fox. Red fox numbers have increased greatly in areas where the wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the European mink is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPhotos of European Mink\nEuropean Mink: Biology and Conservation\nEuropean mink reintroduction project, ex-situ, in-situ research with Dr. Elisabeth Peters, Mustela lutreola, Germany.\n\nWeasels\nCarnivorans of Europe\nMammals of Russia\nCritically endangered animals\nCritically endangered biota of Europe\nMammals described in 1761\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus\nSemiaquatic mammals", "machine_text": " European mink The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the common mink, is a species of mustelid native to Europe and parts of Russia. It is a small, semiaquatic carnivore that is closely related to the North American mink (M. vison). In the past, it was considered to be a subspecies of the latter species, but it is now regarded as a separate species. The European mink occurs in a variety of aquatic habitats, such as lakes, streams, rivers, and wetlands, and also occupies forests and grasslands. It is a solitary and nocturnal species that feeds mainly on small mammals, fish, and birds. The European mink is found in Europe from the British Isles and France in the west to the Soviet Union in the east. It has been reported as far south as Italy and Turkey, and as far north as Norway and Finland. In Russia, it occurs in the areas east of the Ural Mountains and south of the Polar Urals. It is thought to have been introduced to the British Isles after the last ice age, probably by a land bridge from the European continent to Great Britain during the warmer interglacial periods. The European mink is a small, slender animal with a long, thin nose and pointed ears. The fur is typically dark brown or blackish-brown on the head and body, with some white on the chin and throat. The tail is relatively short, measuring less than a third of the animal's total length. The European mink has webbed feet and a flattened skull, which are adapted for an aquatic lifestyle. The European mink is solitary and territorial, with a range of up to 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi). It marks its territory with scent markings and does not share its territory with other minks. It typically lives in small family groups, and the young may stay with their parents for up to a year. The European mink is generally nocturnal, but it may also be active during the day. It feeds mainly on small mammals, fish, and birds, and occasionally also eats insects. It is an effective predator and is known to take down animals as large as rabbits. The European mink is generally considered to be a beneficial species, as it helps to keep populations of small mammals in check. It is also valued for its fur, which is used in the fur trade. However, it is a vulnerable species and is threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and diseases such as the mink enteritis virus (MEV). In some areas, it is also affected by competition with the North American mink, which has been introduced and is now widespread in Europe.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 890259}

The creek's name comes from the French word auxvasse, meaning \"reeds\" or \"willows.\" The area along the creek was settled by French trappers and traders in the early 1700s. The French established a trading post at the mouth of the creek in the early 1800s. The trading post was later occupied by the Spanish and, in 1804, by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The creek begins in northern Pettis County, Missouri, just south of the city of Sedalia. It flows west-southwest through northern Pettis and southern Boone counties, past the communities of Spickard, Auxvasse, and the western outskirts of Columbia. It joins the Missouri River in northern Cooper County, Missouri, about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Boonville. The creek is a small, shallow stream, with a flow of about 65 cubic feet per second (1.7 m3/s). It is formed by the confluence of its East and West Forks, which are both about 25 miles (40 km) long. The East Fork begins in northern Pettis County, just south of the city of Sedalia, and flows south-southwest. The West Fork begins in western Pettis County, about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the East Fork, and flows northwest. The two forks join near the community of Spickard.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Candies Creek Ridge\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Candies Creek Ridge, also known (more commonly in the past) as Clingan Ridge, is a geographic feature ridge located primarily in Bradley County, Tennessee, on the southeastern border of the state. It overlooks Candies Creek and is in north Cleveland, Tennessee. \n\nFound here in 1996 was a large South Appalachian Mississippian culture village, built about 1000-1200 CE. It is unusual in this location, because Mississippian villages were typically found in the bottomlands along rivers and creeks. The 5-acre site was acquired for preservation by The Archeological Conservancy in 2001 and is known as the Jim Sharp Archeological Preserve.\n\nGeography\nThe ridge, one of a series of parallel ridges that are a continuation of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, is one of the tallest, averaging approximately 997 feet (304 meters) of elevation. The highest point, in Cleveland, Tennessee, is 1,014 feet (309 meters). It is also known as Lebanon Ridge south of Cleveland. The ridge stretches from Tunnel Hill, Georgia to the lower Hiwassee River at the Bradley/McMinn County line in Tennessee. \n\nSeveral highways cross the formation, including (from south to north) GA SR 2, TN SR 317, APD-40, US 11/US 64, SR 312, Interstate 75 and SR 60 (together), Paul Huff Parkway, and SR 308.\n\nTo the west is a ridge usually referred to in Tennessee as Mount Zion Ridge, and in the valley between the ridges in Tennessee is Candies Creek. To the east is a ridge referred to in northern Bradley County as Mouse Creek Ridge, and in the valley between is South Mouse Creek. This ridge is called Lead Mine Ridge in the southern part of the Bradley County and in Georgia.\n\nHistory\nAs was the case throughout the river and creek valleys in the Southeast, this area for thousands of years was settled by indigenous cultures. In 1996 a team of archeologists were consulted to investigate possible Cherokee graves at a subdivision development site a few miles west of Candies Creek Ridge. They discovered a large South Appalachian Mississippian culture village, which has been dated to 1000-1200 CE. Architectural remains included a defensive palisade. Archeologists said it was unusual to find such a large Mississippian site in the uplands, as they were more typically developed in bottomlands along rivers. \n\nThe Archeological Conservancy bought the site from the developer, who offered it at less than market, recognizing its historic significance. (This transaction was approved by both the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the Cherokee Nation.) Additional work at the site has found a variety of artifacts, another Mississippian palisade, some human burials, and trade goods associated with the historic Cherokee. After surveying and mapping, the researchers left most of the features and artifacts undisturbed in the ground, to allow opportunity for future studies. The federally recognized Cherokee tribes arranged for reconsecrating the human burials. The site is now named the Jim Sharp Archeological Preserve, for the man who sold the property to the Conservancy.\n\nThe historic Cherokee referred to the creek in the valley west of the ridge in Bradley County as Little Kiuka Creek. Their village nearby overlooked the confluence of two creeks.\n\n19th century to present\nThe waterway was later named by European Americans as Candy's Creek (today is known as Candies Creek) for Henry Candy, who settled along the creek around 1817, after the Cherokee had ceded their land north of the Hiwassee River to the United States. \n\nThe Candy's Creek Cherokee Indian Mission Station, organized in 1824 by Samuel Worcester and five others, was built near their historic village by the creek. Today the intersection of SR 60 and Paul Huff Parkway are south of this former site. The station closed in 1838 after Cherokee Removal; it was notable as the first organized church and post office in Bradley County. The building also contained a school. \n\nA historical marker commemorating the mission station was installed near the historic site along SR 60 in 1959 near the present-day intersection of Paul Huff Parkway. It disappeared, reportedly around the time Paul Huff Parkway was constructed. Candy's Creek Cherokee Elementary, a new school in North Cleveland that opened here in August 2019, was named for the mission station.\n\nIn Bradley County, the ridge is named for the Clingan family, who lived on it in what is now northern Cleveland. A.A. Clingan, one of the family members, was Bradley County's first elected sheriff, serving from 1837 to 1838 and 1840 to 1846. The family of his wife, Martha Blythe, founded Blythe Ferry on the south side of the Tennessee River in Meigs County, Tennessee in 1809. The Clingan family cemetery, located on the western foot of the ridge off SR 60, was rediscovered in 2014 and restored in 2016.\n\nCounties \nGA\nCatoosa County\nWhitfield County\n\nTN\nBradley County\nHamilton County\n\nCities and communities\nCleveland, Tennessee\nMcDonald, Tennessee\nTunnel Hill, Georgia\n\nReferences \n\nRidges of Tennessee\nLandforms of Bradley County, Tennessee\nLandforms of Hamilton County, Tennessee\nLandforms of Catoosa County, Georgia\nLandforms of Whitfield County, Georgia\nSouth Appalachian Mississippian culture\nArchaeological sites in Tennessee\nCleveland, Tennessee\nRidges of Georgia (U.S. state)\nCleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee", "machine_text": " Candies Creek Ridge is a mountain ridge in the U.S. state of South Carolina.

He was a 12th-century Indian Muslim monarch, who according to popular tradition, founded the city of Hyderabad in the year 1589. Malik Ek was born in a family of Persianate Turks who had recently immigrated to India. His father's name was Daud. The family had settled in the city of Daulatabad, which was then a part of the Delhi sultanate. As a young man, Malik Ek worked as a chief guard (eunuch) of the household of the sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish. Iltutmish was a member of the Mamluk dynasty of Delhi, which was a dynasty of Central Asian origin. The Mamluks were a caste of military slaves who had risen to power in the Delhi sultanate. After the death of Iltutmish in 1236, Malik Ek and his family were granted a jagir (fiefdom) in the Deccan region of southern India by the new sultan, Alauddin Khan. The Deccan was a rich agricultural region that was home to a large population of Hindu rulers. The Delhi sultanate had recently begun a campaign to expand its influence into the Deccan. Malik Ek and his family were the first Muslims to settle in the region. They were followed by other Muslim families who were granted land by the Delhi sultanate. Over time, the city of Hyderabad became a major center of trade and commerce, and a key ally of the Delhi sultanate in its efforts to conquer the Deccan. In 1589, the city of Hyderabad was attacked by the Vijayanagara Empire, a Hindu kingdom that ruled over much of the Deccan region. The city was conquered and occupied by the Vijayanagara Empire. The Vijanagara king, Sri Krishnadevaraya, granted the city of Hyderabad to Malik Ek as a jagir (fiefdom). Malik Ek then became the ruler of Hyderabad, which was now a part of the Vijayanagara Empire. He was given the title of \"Malik\" (equivalent to \"Lord\" or \"King\").

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Mohicans\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Mohican ( or , alternate spelling: Mahican) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe that historically spoke an Algonquian language. As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the neighboring Lenape, who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohican occupied the upper tidal Hudson River Valley, including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day Albany, New York, developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic River watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the powerful Mohawk to the west during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Taconic Mountains to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n \nThey combined with Lenape Native Americans (a branch known as the Munsee) in Stockbridge, and later the people moved west away from pressure of European settlement. They settled in what became Shawano County, Wisconsin. Most eastern American Indian populations were forced to reservations in Indian Territory during the 1830s, and other reservations in the American West later. Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Munsee people and have a  reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the American Revolutionary War, most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the Iroquois Oneida on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to sell their lands and relocate to northeastern Wisconsin under the federal Indian Removal program. A group of Mohican also migrated to Ontario, Canada to live with the predominately Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River reserve.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived:  (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\"). The word  refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River , or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters. Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the Munsee to their west, known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and Wappinger) to the south, were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. \n\nThe Dutch heard and transliterated the term for the people of the area in their own language, variously as: Mahigan, Mahikander, Mahinganak, Maikan and Mawhickon, among other variants, which the English later expressed as Mohican or Mahican, in a transliteration to their own spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohican as the  (or wolves). They referred to the Iroquois Confederacy as the \"Snake People\", as they were called by some competitors, or \"Five Nations\", representing their original tribes).  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohican were Algonquian-speaking, part of a large language family related also to the Lenape people, who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the Delaware River valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohican joined other former New York tribes, including the Oneida and some other Iroquois nations, in filing land claims against New York for what were considered unconstitutional purchases of their lands after the Revolutionary War. Only the federal government had constitutional authority to deal with the Indian nations. In 2010, outgoing governor David Paterson announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on  in Sullivan County in the Catskills, as a settlement in exchange for dropping their larger claim in Madison County. The deal had many opponents.\n\nTerritory\nIn their own language, the Mohican identified collectively as the , \"people of the great tidal river\".\n\nAt the time of their first contact with Europeans traders along the river in the 1590s, the Mohican were living in and around the Hudson River (or ). After 1609, at the time of the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, they also ranged along the eastern Mohawk River and the Hoosic River, and south along the Hudson to the Roeliff Jansen Kill, where they bordered on the Wappinger people. This nation inhabited the river area and its interior southward to today's New York City.\n\nMost of the Mohican communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of Lake Champlain.\n\nCulture\nThe Mohican villages were governed by hereditary sachems advised by a council of clan elders. They had a matrilineal kinship system, with property and inheritance (including such hereditary offices) passed through the maternal line. Moravian missionary John Heckewelder and early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan both learned from Mohican informants that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle, and Wolf). These were divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This finding is supported by the evidence of Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of Shirley Dunn).\n\nA general council of sachems met regularly at Scodac (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy. In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, Edward Manning Ruttenber described the clans of the Mohican as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf. Each had a role in the lives of the people, and the Wolf served as warriors in the north to defend against the Mohawk, the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois.\n\nLike the Munsee-speaking communities to their south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. The villages usually consisted of a small cluster of small and mid-sized longhouses, and were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near their communities; the women also cultivated varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Horticulture and the gathering and processing of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others), and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass).\n\nLanguage\nThe now extinct Mohican language belonged to the Eastern Algonquian branch of the Algonquian language family.\n\nHistory\n\nMohican Confederacy\nThe Mohican were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.\n Mohican proper, lived in the vicinity of today's Albany (, \"the fireplace of the Mahican Nation\") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George\n , lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek\nWawyachtonoc (or ,  \"eddy people\" or \"people of the curving channel\"), lived in Dutchess County and Columbia County eastward to the Housatonic River in Litchfield County, Connecticut, main village was Weantinock, additional villages: Shecomeco, Wechquadnach, Pamperaug, Bantam, Weataug, Scaticook\n Westenhuck (from , \"on the other side of the mountains\"), the name of a village near Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Often called the \"Housatonic people\", they lived in the Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in the vicinity of Great Barrington, which they called , meaning \"the place downstream\"\n Wiekagjoc (from , \"upper reaches of a river\"), lived east of the Hudson Rivers near the city of Hudson, Columbia County, New York\n\nConflict with the Mohawk \n\nThe Algonquians (Mohican) and Iroquois (Mohawk) were traditional competitors and enemies. Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the Jesuit Relations, speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and Algonquin (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.\n\nIn September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on Castle Island, on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with Fort Nassau badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground. Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May sailed the  upriver and landed eighteen families of Walloons on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct Fort Orange.\n\nThe Mohicans invited the Algonquin and Montagnais to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the Mohawk River, closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to New Amsterdam because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about a mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.\n\nWar continued to rage between the Mohicans and Mohawks throughout the area from Skahnéhtati (Schenectady) to Kinderhoek Kinderhook. By 1629, the Mohawks had taken over territories on the west bank of the Hudson River that were formerly held by the Mohicans. The conflict caused most of the Mohican to migrate eastward across the Hudson River into western Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.\n\nStockbridge\nMany Mohicans settled in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where they gradually became known as the \"Stockbridge Indians\". , one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710. They were popularly referred to as the Four Mohawk Kings.\n\nThe Stockbridge Indians allowed Protestant missionaries, including Jonathan Edwards, to live among them.  In the 18th century, many converted to Christianity, while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War).  During the American Revolution, they sided with the colonists.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the Moravian Church from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, who founded a mission at their village of  in Dutchess County, New York. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, , also known as ; and , who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at Oley, Pennsylvania. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion. The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European colonists' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor Lewis Morris concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor George Clarke the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor George Clinton, Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case. The lots were eventually bought up by European-American colonists and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret Catholic Jesuits (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at Poughkeepsie expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. European colonists soon took over the Mohican land.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nIn August 1775, the Six Nations staged a council fire near Albany, after news of Bunker Hill had made war seem imminent. After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or Patriots), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir William Johnson, his son John Johnson and son-in-law Guy Johnson and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost forty warriors of their Stockbridge Militia, around half \"Stockbridge Indians\" who were remnants of both Mohican and Wappinger tribes, in a British attack on the land of the van Cortlandt family. (In 1888, the property became Van Courtland Park in the Bronx, New York.) The Battle of Kingsbridge decimated the troop's ranks.  It received a commendation from George Washington, was paid $1,000 and dismissed.\n\nMove to Oneida, New York\nAfter the Revolution the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians, today regarded as Stockbridge Munsee, moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the Oneida people in central New York, who had been granted a  reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of . They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At New Stockbridge they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.\n\nRemoval to Wisconsin\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to Shawano County, Wisconsin, where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of Indian removal. In Wisconsin, they settled on reservations with the Lenape (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of Bowler. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.\n\nLand claims\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for  in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor David Paterson announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly  in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.\n\nIn 2011, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of the Mohican Indians regained ownership 156 acres along the Hudson River, a tract known as Papscanee Island Nature Preserve near East Greenbush and Schodack. The land was donated to descendants of its indigenous inhabitants by the Open Space Initiative. Prior to colonization, the island was used for ceremonies by the Mohicans before it was acquired by Dutch merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 1637. The property is managed by Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer Land Trust for public access and protection, while owned by the Mohicans.\n\nRepresentation in media\nJames Fenimore Cooper based his novel, The Last of the Mohicans, on the Mohican tribe. His description includes some cultural aspects of the Mohegan, a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern Connecticut. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as Uncas.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920. Michael Mann directed a 1992 adaptation, which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as a Mohican-adopted white man.\n\nNotable members\n Etow Oh Koam, Mohican sachem and one of the Four Indian Kings, who, with three Mohawk leaders, made a state visit to Queen Anne and her government in England in 1710.\n Hendrick Aupaumut, (1757–1830) sachem, historian, and American Revolutionary War captain\n Steve Conliff, (1949-2006) political writer, historian, Yippie activist\n Brent Michael Davids, (b. 1959) composer/flautist \n Bill Miller, (b. 1955) musician\n Electa Quinney, (1798–1885) first public teacher and school mistress in Wisconsin\n John Wannuaucon Quinney, (1797–1855) diplomat\n Don Coyhis (born August 16, 1943), addiction specialist, Native American health activist and author.\n\nSee also \n Native American tribes in Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Aupaumut, Hendrick.

They include three tribes: the Mohawks, who are based in New York; the Oneidas, who are based in Wisconsin and New York; and the Stockbridge-Munsee, who are based in Wisconsin. The Mohican language, part of the Eastern Algonquian family, is closely related to that of the Delaware and other Algonquian languages. The Mohican tribes were traditional participants in the fur trade, and played a significant role in the early history of the United States. The Mohican people originally lived in the region of New York and the upper Hudson River. They had lived in the area for thousands of years, as evidenced by the numerous prehistoric artifacts which have been found in the region. In the 17th century, the Mohican traded with the Dutch at Fort Orange (now Albany, New York). In the 18th century, the Mohican sold their lands and moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and later to Wisconsin. Mohican people were prominent in a number of wars. In the 17th century, they joined the Wampanoag in the Pequot War. In the 18th century, they joined the British in the French and Indian War, and the American Revolution. In the early 21st century, Mohican reservations included the Akwesasne Reservation, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, and the Oneida Reservation. The Mohican Nation also had communities in Wisconsin, and one each in New York, Washington DC, and Canada. In the 2000 census, 17,454 people in the United States identified as Mohican, up from 15,713 in the 1990 census. The name \"Mohican\" is an exonym; the Mohican called themselves \"lenape\", meaning \"the people\". The Mohican were also called the Maqua, based on the name of a tribe in New York. The Maqua were a branch of the Mohican living in the St. Lawrence River area, in present-day Canada. The Mohican were an important ally of the Dutch in the 17th century. In the early 1600s, the Mohican traded with the Dutch at Fort Orange (present-day Albany, New York). They provided the Dutch with furs, and received in return trade goods such as guns, ammunition, metal tools, and alcoholic beverages. The Mohican were one of the five original members of the League of Iroquois, but two centuries later they had become a distinct group. The Mohican were involved in a number of wars with the British, the French, and other tribes. In the 17th century, the Mohican joined the Wampanoag in the Pequot War, and aided the English against the Dutch. In the 18th century, the Mohican joined the British in the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War), and the American Revolution. The Mohican were a large tribe, with a number of divisions. The Mohican were closely related to the other Algonquian-speaking tribes in the region, and shared the basic culture and language of these tribes. The Mohican language is a dialect of the Eastern Algonquian language, which is closely related to the language of the Delaware and other Algonquian languages. The Mohican were semi-nomadic, and lived in seasonal settlements. They hunted and gathered food, and planted fields of corn and other crops. The Mohican were skilled fishermen and boaters, and traveled by canoe. The Mohican were a patrilineal society, with children taking the surname and clan of their father. The Mohican were a matrilineal society with children taking the surname and clan of their mother. The Mohican were a bilateral society, with children taking the surname and clan of either their father or their mother. The Mohican were a politically decentralized tribe, with no central authority. The Mohican were a politically centralized tribe, with a chief and clan elders making decisions for the tribe. The Mohican were a friendly and welcoming people, and were known to help other tribes. The Mohican were a warlike and expansionist people, and were known to raid other tribes for captives and territory. The Mohican were a trading people, and traded with other tribes and European settlers. The Mohican were a hunting and gathering people, and hunted for meat, furs, and other animal products. The Mohican were a farming people, and grew corn, beans, and other crops. The Mohican were a religious people, and believed in a creator god and a spirit world.

He has scored centuries (100 runs or more) in both Test and One Day International (ODI) matches. In 2000, he was knighted for his services to cricket, and during the same year named as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. He is generally considered one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and in 2002 he was honoured by Wisden, who named him as the greatest ODI batsman of all time, and the third greatest Test batsman. Four years later, he was given the Most Exalted Order of National Hero award in his native Antigua.\n\nRichards made his Test debut against India in November 1974, and scored his maiden Test century during the second Test of the same tour, scoring an unbeaten 192 in the first-innings of the match. In 1976, he scored seven Test centuries in a calendar year, passing Garfield Sobers' record of six which had been set in 1958. He scored his maiden double century in the first Test of that year's tour of England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham making 232. After scoring a century in the third Test, he once again scored a double century in the fifth Test, accumulating his highest score, 291, at The Oval, London. These centuries, and a total of 1,710 Test runs in the year, helped him to be named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. In 1986, facing England at the Antigua Recreation Ground, Richards scored the fastest century in Test cricket, reaching his twentieth Test hundred in 56 balls.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Earth's rotation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Earth's rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris, Earth turns counterclockwise.\n\nThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.\n\nEarth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds. Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend; the length of a day increased about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BCE. Scientists reported that in 2020 Earth has started spinning faster, after consistently spinning slower than 86,400 seconds per day in the decades before. Because of that, engineers worldwide are discussing a 'negative leap second' and other possible timekeeping measures.\n\nHistory\nAmong the ancient Greeks, several of the Pythagorean school believed in the rotation of Earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.\n\nA more conventional picture was supported by Hicetas, Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that Earth rotated but did not suggest that Earth revolved about the Sun. In the third century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos suggested the Sun's central place.\n\nHowever, Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about Earth. This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE), who thought Earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.\n\nIn 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata suggested that the spherical Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of Earth. He provided the following analogy: \"Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward.\"\n\nIn the 10th century, some Muslim astronomers accepted that Earth rotates around its axis. According to al-Biruni, Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. circa 1020) invented an astrolabe called al-zūraqī based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries \"that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.\" The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: \"According to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandisīn), the Earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the Earth and not the stars.\" Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it. At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.\n\nIn medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas accepted Aristotle's view and so, reluctantly, did John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of Earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of Earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central Sun.\n\nTycho Brahe, who produced accurate observations on which Kepler based his laws of planetary motion, used Copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary Earth. In 1600, William Gilbert strongly supported Earth's rotation in his treatise on Earth's magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries. Those like Gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of Earth about the Sun are called \"semi-Copernicans\". A century after Copernicus, Riccioli disputed the model of a rotating Earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies; such deflections would later be called the Coriolis effect. However, the contributions of Kepler, Galileo and Newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of Earth.\n\nEmpirical tests\nEarth's rotation implies that the Equator bulges and the geographical poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the pendulum measurements taken by Richer in 1673 as corroboration of the change in gravity, but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the oblateness of Earth, thus confirming the positions of both Newton and Copernicus.\n\nIn Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the Northern Hemisphere (and left in the Southern) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of cyclone rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and clockwise, respectively).\n\nHooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of , but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in Bologna, Johann Friedrich Benzenberg in Hamburg and Ferdinand Reich in Freiberg, using taller towers and carefully released weights. A ball dropped from a height of 158.5 m departed by 27.4 mm from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1 mm.\n\nThe most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the Foucault pendulum first built by physicist Léon Foucault in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended  from the top of the Panthéon in Paris. Because of Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about  clockwise per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the world.\n\nPeriods\n\nTrue solar day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the Sun (solar noon to solar noon) is its true solar day or apparent solar day. It depends on Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two. The true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the Sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual, taking about  longer to do so. Conversely, it is about  shorter near aphelion. It is about  longer near a solstice when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about . Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near  by  solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near  when it is only  longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near  and  by  and , respectively.\n\nMean solar day\n\nThe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day, which contains . Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an SI second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than . Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms. The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.\n\nThe apparent solar time is a measure of Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.\n\nStellar and sidereal day\n\nEarth's rotation period relative to the International Celestial Reference Frame, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is  seconds of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing mean vernal equinox, named sidereal day, is  of mean solar time (UT1) , ). Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about .\n\nBoth the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about  . This is a result of the Earth turning 1 additional rotation, relative to the celestial reference frame, as it orbits the Sun (so 366.25 rotations/y). The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods  and .\n\nRecently (1999–2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of  has varied between  and , which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see Fluctuations in the length of day).\n\nAngular speed\n\nThe angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is  ± . Multiplying by (180°/π radians) × (86,400 seconds/day) yields , indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun. Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of  (WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of . Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or . This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by . However, the use of the solar day is incorrect; it must be the sidereal day, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, , which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km/h.\n\nThe tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude. For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at latitude 28.59° N, which yields a speed of: cos(28.59°) × 1674.4 km/h = 1470.2 km/h. Latitude is a placement consideration for spaceports.\n\nThe peak of the Cayambe volcano is the point of Earth's surface farthest from its axis; thus, it rotates the fastest as Earth spins.\n\nChanges\n\nIn rotational axis \n\nEarth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and nutation. It also moves with respect to Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.\n\nPrecession is a rotation of Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the Chandler wobble.\n\nIn rotational speed\n\nTidal interactions \nOver millions of years, Earth's rotation has been slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the Moon. Thus angular momentum is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to , where  is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process has gradually increased the length of the day to its current value, and resulted in the Moon being tidally locked with Earth.\n\nThis gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented by estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites; a compilation of these measurements found that the length of the day has increased steadily from about 21 hours at 600 Myr ago to the current 24-hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.\n\nResonant stabilization \n\nThe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600 Myr ago. Some models suggest that Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the Precambrian. This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600 Myr ago; the simulated results agree quite closely with existing paleorotational data.\n\nGlobal events \n\nSome recent large-scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by reducing Earth's moment of inertia. Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is also changing the distribution of Earth's mass, thus affecting the moment of inertia of Earth and, by the conservation of angular momentum, Earth's rotation period.\n\nThe length of the day can also be influenced by manmade structures. For example, NASA scientists calculated that the water stored in the Three Gorges Dam has increased the length of Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds due to the shift in mass.\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe primary monitoring of Earth's rotation is performed by very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the Global Positioning System, satellite laser ranging, and other satellite geodesy techniques. This provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time, precession, and nutation.\nThe absolute value of Earth rotation including UT1 and nutation can be determined using space geodetic observations, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry and Lunar laser ranging, whereas their derivatives, denoted as Length-of-day excess and nutation rates can be derived from satellite observations, such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Satellite laser ranging to geodetic satellites.\n\nAncient observations\nThere are recorded observations of solar and lunar eclipses by Babylonian and Chinese astronomers beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from the medieval Islamic world  and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning Earth was turning faster throughout the past.\n\nCyclic variability \nAround every 25–30 years Earth's rotation slows temporarily by a few milliseconds per day, usually lasting around 5 years. 2017 was the fourth consecutive year that Earth's rotation has slowed. The cause of this variability has not yet been determined.\n\nOrigin \n\nEarth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust, rocks, and gas that coalesced to form the Solar System. This primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas. As this interstellar dust is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.\n\nHowever, if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the Theia impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact. Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.\n\nSee also \n\n Allais effect\n Diurnal cycle\n Earth's orbit\n Earth orientation parameters\n Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n Geodesic (in mathematics)\n Geodesics in general relativity\n Geodesy\n History of Earth\n History of geodesy\n Inner core super-rotation\n List of important publications in geology\n Nychthemeron\n Spherical Earth\n World Geodetic System\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nUSNO Earth Orientation new site, being populated\nUSNO IERS old site, to be abandoned\nIERS Earth Orientation Center: Earth rotation data and interactive analysis\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\nIf the Earth's rotation period is less than 24 hours, why don't our clocks fall out of sync with the Sun?\n\nDynamics of the Solar System\nRotation\nRotation", "machine_text": " Earth's rotation The Earth rotates on its axis, which is the imaginary line it spins around, from west to east. The Earth's axis is tilted at about 23.4 degrees, or about 40,075 km from the equator. This means that the sun appears to be higher in the sky during the northern hemisphere's summer months and higher in the sky during the southern hemisphere's summer months. The rotation of the Earth on its axis from west to east is called prograde rotation. This is due to the angle of the Earth's tilt in its orbit around the sun. The Earth's rotation is also known as diurnal motion, daily motion, or axial rotation. The Earth rotates on its axis from west to east, and the sun and moon appear to move from east to west across the sky. The spinning of the Earth around its axis is called rotation, while the movement of the Earth around the sun is called revolution. The revolution of the Earth around the sun takes about one year, and the rotation of the Earth around its axis takes about 24 hours. The Earth's rotation is affected by the gravitational forces of the sun and moon. The sun's gravity pulls the Earth toward it, while the moon's gravity pulls the Earth away from it. This causes the Earth to rotate on its axis from west to east. The Earth's rotation is also affected by the Coriolis effect, a force that results from the Earth's movement around the sun. The Coriolis effect causes the Earth to rotate on its axis in a slightly curved path, which results in the Earth's rotation being slightly longer than 24 hours. The Earth's rotation is measured by the rotation angle, which is the angle between the Earth's current position and its starting position. The rotation angle is given by the equation: where ω is the rotation frequency (in rad/s), ϕ is the rotation angle (in rad), and t is the time (in s). The rotation frequency is given by the equation: where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the radius of the Earth. The Earth's rotation is also measured by the rotation period, which is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation around its axis. The rotation period is given by the equation: where ω is the rotation frequency (in rad/s) and t is the time (in s). The Earth's rotation period is approximately 24 hours. This means that the Earth completes one rotation around its axis in about 24 hours. The Earth's rotation period can vary slightly due to gravitational forces from the sun and moon, as well as from the Coriolis effect.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4396171}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "From August 22 to August 24, 1992  violent xenophobic riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock, Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against migrants in postwar Germany. Stones and petrol bombs were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant right-wing extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.\n\nThe initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised. For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers. Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond, and, when they did, their responses were considered inadequate. Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for days with little or no access to basic facilities. This was contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.\n\nBetween 22 and 26 August 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former West Germany; 217 from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including 147 from Rostock; and another 37 from the former East Germany. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured. No one was killed.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Zentrale Aufnahmestelle für Asylbewerber für Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (ZAst M-V), or \"Central Refugee Shelter\" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was in an 11-storey plattenbau apartment complex known as the \"Sunflower House\" or \"Sunflower Tower\", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the asylum seekers there were living and the lack of support (if any) provided for them. The authorities had ignored  numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.\n\nRioting\nThe shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily Roma from Romania, they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.\n\nFor days prior to the riots, the newspapers Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten and Ostsee-Zeitung had been calling for a \"Lichtenhagen interest group\". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not \"cleaned up,\" order would be made. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year-old skinhead said, \"The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!\"\n\nThe first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged neo-Nazis to roam the area. This led to a situation where a xenophobic mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a ZDF television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Below, a mob of over 3,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.\n\nCharges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist police state. There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.\n\nThe first major conviction relating to the riots was on 4 March 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year-old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness. It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.\n\nThe following timeline was reconstructed by the \"Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident\" (\"Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst\").\n\nTimeline\n\nAugust 22, Day 1\nFrom about 6:00 p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02 p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46 p.m., police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02 p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24 p.m. another police unit arrived from Schwerin. At 1:34 a.m. water cannons were set up and put to continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34 a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the autobahn. At 2:25 a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30 a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued tear gas and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30 a.m.\n\nDay 1 Statistics: 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 1\n\n100 people gathered in front of the shelter. At 11:15 a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from Schwerin, Anklam, Stralsund and Güstrow. The Landespolizei force of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units (Einsatzhundertschaften) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15 p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known neo-Nazis in the area.\n\nAugust 23, Day 2, Part 2\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18 p.m. the rioters started throwing Molotov cocktails. 8:00 p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30 p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00 p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30 p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41 p.m. state police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).\n\nThe state level of emergency allowed for additional federal brigades to be called in.  Hamburg sent out its SWAT (SEK and MBK) units. These riot police units of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two police dog squads from Kiel, a reserve unit from Lübeck, and helicopters from the federal police.\n\nAt 2:55 a.m. The second Hamburg unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45 a.m. the first Hamburg unit arrived. At 4:10 a.m. the situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.\n\nDay 2 Statistics: 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 1\n\n2:00 p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action), the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00 p.m. The police learned of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively if the shelter was cleared out.\n\nAugust 24, Day 3, Part 2\n\n7:45 p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55 p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.\n\nAt 8:00 p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the second Hamburg unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05 p.m. squads from the second Hamburg unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using batons. The commanding officer of the first Hamburg unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, Hafenstraße and Flora.\n\nAt 8:15 p.m. The first Hamburg unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and police cordons were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was \"Officers in distress.\" The first Hamburg unit also provided support.\n\nAt 8:40 p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20 p.m. the retreating first Hamburg unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade MV. At 9:34 p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37 p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a police cordon and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55 p.m. the first Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began clearing out the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the second Hamburg unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30 a.m. the area settled down.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00 a.m., the situation was under control.\n\nDay 3 Statistics: 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.\n\nCopycat acts\n\nIn the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis attacked 40 residences with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police.  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in Wismar, Rostock-Hinrichshagen, Lübz, and Neubrandenburg were attacked, and there were three such incidents in Greifswald. In Wismar there was a six-day riot between 15 and 20 September in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were attacks almost daily. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in Güstrow Ueckermünde Kröpelin, Schwarzendorf (in the district of Malchin), Schwerin, Wismar, and Retschow were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nThe attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild. \n\nCases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped. Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated between two and three years; the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.\n\nAn investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent Jürgen Deckert for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.\n\nMedia\n Mark Saunders. \"The Truth Lies in Rostock (AVI, 698,7 MB)]\" (BRD, Great Britain, 78 min.) /  1993 von Mark Saunders & Siobhan Cleary - 121 min\n Wir Sind Jung.

The riots were the most serious in the post-war history of the GDR and contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the GDR. At the end of August 1992, a group of neo-Nazis started to attack ethnic minority groups in the area. The attacks were mainly directed at the houses of Vietnamese in the district of Lichtenhagen. The police did not take action, which led to further escalate the riots. On September 2, 1992, a Friday, the Zionskirche (Zion Church) in Lichtenhagen was set on fire by three young men. The church was a cult meeting point for the Neo-Nazis. The police arrested the three young men but released them the next day. On Sunday, September 6, 1992, a large crowd of Neo-Nazis demonstrated in front of the church. The police tried to stop the demonstration but failed and the crowd marched through the streets, throwing stones and bottles at the police and setting fire to cars and shops. The police used tear gas but could not stop the riots. Over the next days, the riots spread to other districts of Rostock and to the neighboring city of Stralsund. The police arrested hundreds of rioters but could not stop the riots. On September 9, 1992, the Zionskirche was set on fire again by a man who was immediately arrested. The next day, a group of about 300 neo-Nazis tried to attack the mosque in Rostock-Schmarl. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to stop the attack. On September 11, 1992, the National People's Army (NVA) deployed a helicopter over the city of Rostock for the first time since the Second World War. The helicopter was used to observe the riots. On September 13, 1992, a group of about 2,000 neo-Nazis demonstrated in front of the town hall in Rostock. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to stop the demonstration. On September 14, 1992, the NVA deployed a helicopter over the city of Stralsund for the first time since the Second World War. The helicopter was used to observe the riots. On September 16, 1992, a group of about 2,500 neo-Nazis demonstrated in front of the town hall in Stralsund. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to stop the demonstration. On September 17, 1992, the NVA deployed a helicopter over the city of Greifswald for the first time since the Second World War. The helicopter was used to observe the riots. The riots were a major problem for the government of the GDR. The police were not able to stop the riots and the NVA was deployed for the first time since the Second World War. The government of the GDR had to take action to end the riots. On September 21, 1992, the government of the GDR held a meeting to discuss the riots. The meeting was attended by the leaders of the GDR, the police, and the NVA. The government of the GDR announced that it would take action to end the riots. On September 22, 1992, the NVA deployed a helicopter over the city of Schwerin for the first time since the Second World War. The helicopter was used to observe the riots. On September 24, 1992, a group of about 2,000 neo-Nazis demonstrated in front of the town hall in Schwerin. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to stop the demonstration. The Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots were a series of riots in the autumn of 1992 in the Rostock district of Lichtenhagen. The riots were the most serious in the post-war history of the GDR and contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the GDR.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15563818}

He played in fifteen Test matches and was captaining the national side on thirteen occasions (six Test matches) between 1924 and 1926.\n\nRugby career\nThorn, a flanker, was born in Sydney and claimed a total of fifteen international rugby caps for Australia. His brother Joe, though Ted's junior by three years, represented the Waratahs first in 1921. Ted made his state representative debut in 1922, appearing three times for the New South Wales Waratahs against the visiting All Blacks for two victories. With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches – including fifteen such appearances made by Ted Thorn.\n\nThorn made the 1923 New South Wales tour of New Zealand playing in every one of the ten tour matches. Although the tour was not a success with only two matches being won, Thorn returned with his reputation intact. In 1924 when the All Blacks visited Australia, Thorn played in all three matches and in the final match he debuted as captain for the Waratahs, now in the record books as national captain. In the 1925 season he again captained New South Wales in two Tests against New Zealand, withdrawing with injury from the third match of the series. On the tour to New Zealand later that year he was selected as tour captain and played in the first seven matches before a wrist injury saw him stand down from the Test, passing the captaincy to Tom Lawton.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n Howell, Max (2005) Born to Lead – Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ\n\nOnline\nTed Thorn at scrum.com\n\nAustralian rugby union players\nAustralia international rugby union players\nRugby union flankers", "machine_text": " Ted Thorn (born July 27, 1945) is an American politician and educator from the state of Oregon.

Fishman (Ph.D., 1978) is a communication scholar specializing in communication law, crisis communication, public relations, media criticism, broadcast regulations, and public speaking at Boston College.\n\nEducation\nFishman completed his undergraduate coursework at the University of Minnesota, and he received both of his graduate degrees from Northwestern University where he was briefly employed.\n\nCareer\nFishman currently serves as associate professor and assistant chair of the department of communication at Boston College. He also holds the position of first vice president-elect of the Eastern Communication Association. In addition, he is the chair of the Eastern Communication Association's Task Force on the Status of Interest Groups, and the vice-chair and primary planner for the Commission on Parliamentary Procedure's associated with the National Communication Association (Boston College).\n\nHe has received awards for his contributions to the field, including the 1998 Haiman Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Freedom of Expression from the National Communication Association, the 2001 Phifer Award for Outstanding Scholarship in Parliamentary Procedure from the Commission on American Parliamentary Practice, the 2001 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention, and the 2003 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention.\n\nContributions and works \nFishman's most cited piece of literature is titled “ValuJet Flight 592: Crisis communication theory blended and extended.” In this work, Fishman uses the communication surrounding the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 as the scenario for which he applies a type of blended methodology approach to crisis communication. The blend he devised uses components from three previously existing crisis communication theories: Steven Fink's Natural History Approach, William Benoit's Image Restoration Approach, and Thomas Birkland's Focusing Events Approach.\n\nThe paper begins by discussing the event the blended method is being applied to (the disaster itself). An introduction to some of the communication surrounding the event is presented,  including public addresses from  Senior Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officer David Hinsonand, and a  damage control speech given by the United States Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, who is quoted in the paper saying, \"I've flown ValuJet. ValuJet is a safe airline, as is our entire aviation system. Whenever we have found any issues, ValuJet has been responsive, they have been cooperative, they have in some cases even exceeded the safety standards that we have.\"\n\nThe paper then defines crisis communication largely in terms of what is and is not a legitimate crisis situation, and how the word is improperly used in many context today. It is continued by briefly explaining each of the three approaches that are used to create the blended methodology. In the paper Fishman states, “The models used in conjunction strengthen rather than undermine the claims that each approach offers, and that each model provides insights that reinforce constructs that the other model ignores or undervalues.” He applies his blend to the ValuJet crisis by demonstrating what pieces of each model most appropriately fit each step in the crisis communication process. For example, he applies the Prodromal Stage of Fink's model to the initial occurrence of the ValuJet crash, because Benoit's model would require an accusation, and is more appropriate than Birkland's “focusing event” concept. This application theme continues throughout the paper, thus making Fishman's large contribution blended methodology.\n\nFishman does, however, state in the paper that the blended theory method may not be applicable in all crisis communication situations. However, he finds many scenarios in which he his blended methodology was applicable. Among these are the United States Navy’s 1991 Tailhook sexual misconduct scandal, Tylenol's 1982 cyanide mishap, Exxon's 1989 Valdez oil spill, and more.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\nBoston College people\nUniversity of Minnesota alumni\nNorthwestern University alumni\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": " David Alan Fishman (born July 31, 1949) is an American author, journalist, and businessman.

Its body and dorsal forewings are a deep green color. The dorsal hindwings have purple-blue patches, yellow borders, and a red spot near the inner margin. The underside is yellow green and gray purple. Like most moths in the family Sphingidae, caterpillars pupate in burrows.

Occasionally winds carry them to other places, such as Missouri, southern Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maine, and southern Saskatchewan.\n\nLife cycle\nFemale adults lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plant, mainly grapes (Vitis), and vine (Cissus). Caterpillars hatch and start eating, resembling the head of a snake. When they are ready to pupate, they climb down their host plant and burrow underground. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone odor plume.

The duo is known for their quirky approach to songwriting; their music is often accompanied by sophisticated and acerbic lyrics, often about women, and sometimes containing literary references, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified by the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. Russell Mael has a distinctive wide-ranging voice, while Ron Mael plays keyboards in an intricate and rhythmic style. They have been much more successful in Europe than in their native U.S., though they maintain a loyal cult following in the States.\n\nEarly career highlights included \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and marking a stylistic shift towards new wave/synth-pop; \"When I'm With You\", which made the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single \"I Predict\", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single \"Cool Places\" with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way', which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.\n\nTheir frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music. The 2002 release of Lil' Beethoven, their \"genre-defining opus\", as well as Hello Young Lovers (2006, their 20th studio album), Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), and their fantasy radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009–2010) brought Sparks renewed critical and commercial success, and saw them continue to \"steer clear of pop conventions\".\n\nIn 2015, the band released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released Hippopotamus, which entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7, as did their next album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four. Sparks are involved in two 2021 movies: the French musical Annette, starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and The Sparks Brothers, a documentary about their fifty-year career, directed by Edgar Wright. At the 2022 Césars which is the French films ceremony, the band received a César for best original music for Annette.\n\nHistory\n\nInception\nBrothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in west Los Angeles County, California, during the \"Golden Age\" of the LA club scene, when the Doors, the Standells, and Love played the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys played in the late afternoon at  Teen-Age Fair at Pickwick Recreation Center in Burbank, California.\n\nBoth Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art and Russell, theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered \"cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that\", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as \"Anglophiles\".\n\nTheir very first recordings were made under the name of \"Urban Renewal Project\", on January 14, 1967, at the Fidelity Recording Studios in Hollywood. Four tracks were recorded with married couple Fred and Ronna Frank, who were close friends of the Maels at the time. The songs were pressed on two acetates and have never been released, apart from the track \"Computer Girl\", which was featured on a CD included with the Japanese semi-biography from 2006 and more widely released on the Past Tense greatest hits album in 2019. The other three tracks were entitled \"The Windmill\", \"A Quick Thought\" and \"As You Like It\". Of all four songs, \"Computer Girl\" was the least traditional.\n\nForming Halfnelson, named after a wrestling hold, in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their debut album was released on Bearsville Records in 1971 with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey's brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing. It sold poorly. The Whole Burbank Catalog, a 1972 Warner Brothers $2, 2-LP loss leader sampler included, \"Biology II\". After renaming themselves Sparks in 1972, a play on the Marx Brothers, the album was then re-released by Bearsville Records in 1972 as Sparks. The re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit \"Wonder Girl\".\n\nTheir follow-up album, A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following.\n\nEarly 1970s\n\nRelocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\"Wanted bass player for Sparks.  Must be beard free and exciting\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \"Dinky\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\".\n\nSparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", \"Amateur Hour\" and \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache.\n\nGordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977.\n\nThe follow-up albums, Propaganda and Indiscreet, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles \"Looks, Looks, Looks\", \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" and \"Something for the Girl with Everything\".\n\nReturn home\nThe Maels returned home to Los Angeles in 1976. Concerned that their music may have become stale, they adopted a more \"American\" sound and recorded Big Beat with Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser on production, which they followed with Introducing Sparks; both albums were mostly recorded with session musicians. This new \"West Coast\" sound yielded such songs as \"Nothing to Do\", \"Everybody's Stupid\", and \"Throw Her Away (and Get a New One)\". In 1976, Sparks made one of their first forays into the movie business, making a cameo appearance in the disaster-suspense film Rollercoaster, after Kiss turned down the roles. They performed the songs \"Fill 'Er Up\" and \"Big Boy\".\n\nBy 1977 the brothers found themselves at a crossroads. They had grown tired of recording within a traditional rock band framework and were determined to take their music in a more electronic direction. In a conversation with a German journalist, they expressed their admiration for Giorgio Moroder, a pioneer of electronic disco and pop music. Moroder happened to be a friend of the journalist, and he was able to connect the brothers with the Italian producer, who produced their next album, No. 1 in Heaven. More synthesizer-based than their previous efforts, the album would redefine Sparks' sound and challenge the concept of what is meant by a band, and it also became a major influence on emerging electronic pop artists. It spawned two singles in the top-fifteen UK chart: \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" and \"Beat The Clock\". The follow-up album in 1980, Terminal Jive, had a hit single in France, \"When I'm With You\", which led to the Maels staying in the country for a year promoting the album, during which Russell became conversationally fluent in French. The single also hit the Top 20 in Australia, reaching No.14. \nIn 1981, Belgian synth pop group Telex enlisted Sparks to help write the lyrics for their third album, Sex.\n\nFinding the electronic equipment that they had adopted for their new sound too cumbersome for touring, the band returned to the more conventional band format for their next three releases, although they did not eschew synthesizers entirely: Whomp That Sucker, Angst in My Pants, (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie Valley Girl) and In Outer Space. They broke into the US singles chart once more, reaching No. 49 with \"Cool Places\" from 1983's In Outer Space. The track was a collaboration with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin (who at one time ran her own Sparks fan club), and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles' KROQ-FM radio station, which hailed them as local heroes. In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film Bad Manners (aka: Growing Pains), including the film's title song, \"Bad Manners\". In 1989, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with \"Singing in the Shower\", sung in duet with Rita Mitsouko: the single was produced by Tony Visconti. \n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga Mai, the Psychic Girl into a musical, with interest from Tim Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's Columbia Pictures. The release of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a \"second wind\", vocalist Russell Mael explained. \"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.\" On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.\n\n1990s – A new beginning\nIn 1993, Ron and Russell returned with the single \"National Crime Awareness Week\", their first release since the 1988 album Interior Design. The song was produced by the Scottish dance band Finitribe. In 1994, the Maels released Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, providing the hit singles \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way' and \"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)\". In Germany, \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way was the No. 1 airplay song for 1994 as well as being hailed critically for its poignant lyrics and touching melody. The band toured in support of the album with percussionist Christi Haydon playing drums. Haydon also appeared in the videos for \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\" and \"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)\", which were both directed by Sophie Muller.\n\n1997 saw the release of Plagiarism, an album of cover versions of their own songs featuring collaborations with Faith No More, Erasure and Jimmy Somerville. Half of the album was recorded by Tony Visconti in London with the other half recorded by the brothers in their own purpose-built studio in LA, surrounded by busts of Elvis. In 1998 they recorded the soundtrack for the action film Knock Off, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by the acclaimed Hong Kong-based producer/director Tsui Hark (who had appeared on his own tribute song by the band on the album Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins).\n\nBalls, released in 2000, again put the band in a context of electronic instrumentation with some of Ron's most striking and perceptive lyrics. With the release of Balls the band toured the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia.\n\n2000s\nAfter Balls, the band resurfaced in 2002 with the release of an album described as their \"genre-defining opus\" – Lil' Beethoven, featuring quasi-classical arrangements of strings and choirs. Lil' Beethoven led to renewed interest in the band. Record Collector magazine named the album as one of its \"Best New Albums of 2002\", describing it as \"...possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long-established act\" and later in 2003 saying \"...it really does feel like one of the best albums ever made.\" A UK and European tour had the band playing the entire album each night in the first half of the show, with fan favourites making up the second. The line-up now included former Faith No More guitarist Dean Menta in addition to Tammy Glover on drums. Long-time fan Morrissey invited Sparks to perform at the 2004 Meltdown Festival, of which he was curator. They performed their breakthrough Kimono My House album, followed by Lil Beethoven, both in their entirety. Also in this period, the duo appeared in the music video for the Darkness' Justin Hawkins's cover of \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", in which Ron and Russell play the referee and MC at a darts match between Hawkins and darts champion Phil Taylor. This version of \"This Town\" reached No.6 in the UK charts. Sparks would later release Lil' Beethoven's closing track Suburban Homeboy as a single.\n\nFebruary 2006 saw the release of Hello Young Lovers, their twentieth studio album. The album is regarded as carrying on where Lil' Beethoven left off, being described as \"...cynical, intelligent and very, very funny\", it has met with considerable acclaim. Sparks led off the album with the striking tune that the BBC deemed too provocative in its title to play, \"Dick Around\". The song is a multi-section, multi-mood, highly layered track that many felt should have been a UK smash hit had the BBC not misinterpreted the title of the song as being other than it was.\n\nThe brothers tend to be dismissive of the latest trends in popular music, seeing most current bands as lacking musical ambition and experimental drive. Indeed, the predictable trends in much of modern rock, as they see it, served as inspiration for their latest album. However, they have expressed admiration for Eminem and Morrissey.\n\nThe pair appeared in the season 6 finale of the US TV show Gilmore Girls, performing \"Perfume\" from the album Hello Young Lovers. They released a live DVD of a September 2006 show at The Forum as well as a long-awaited CD release of their previously unavailable 1977 album Introducing Sparks. The track \"Perfume\" was featured in a Dolce & Gabbana TV commercial in 2009.\n\nOn May 12, 2008, Sparks released the single \"Good Morning\", taken from the album Exotic Creatures of the Deep.\n\nMay and June 2008 saw the 21-night \"Sparks Spectacular\" in London, where they played each of their albums in chronological order during the first twenty nights and premiered their new album on the twenty-first concert on June 13, 2008. Each night, they performed an album in its entirety followed by a rare track– many of the songs had never been performed live before. The band asked their fans to visit their website and vote for the track that they'd most like to hear the band perform during the second half of the 21st concert after the premiere of Exotic Creatures of the Deep, though Russell admitted that he and Ron would probably influence the poll a little.\n\nFans who bought a \"Golden Ticket\" (which allowed entry into all 21 gigs) also received a poster signed by the band and a CD single entitled \"Islington N1\", a reference to the postal address of the venue for the first 20 gigs. The song \"Islington N1\" was later made available in the box set edition of their \"New Music For Amnesiacs\" career-spanning box set.\n\nIn 2009 the band played two consecutive nights at The Forum on 20 and 21 March. They played Exotic Creatures of the Deep in its entirety at both gigs, followed by Kimono My House in its entirety on the first night and No.1 in Heaven in its entirety on the second night.\n\nValentine's Day evening 2009 saw Sparks perform the same show featuring their Exotic Creatures of the Deep and Kimono My House albums played in their entirety before a sold-out hometown crowd at Royce Hall at the Mael Bros. alma mater in Los Angeles, UCLA.\n\nRon and Russell appeared as interview subjects in the 2009 documentary The Magnificent Tati, discussing their involvement during the early 1980s in Confusion, a proposed Jacques Tati movie for which a screenplay was written but never shot (due to Tati's death).\n\nThe Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009)\n\nOn August 14, 2009, the band premiered the radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, commissioned by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsjö, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, tells the story of Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with Smiles of a Summer Night (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q&A with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director Guy Maddin.\n\nOn June 25, 2011, as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sparks presented the World Premiere live performance of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Canadian film director Guy Maddin provided directions based on the screenplay, with Ron and Russell reprising their recorded roles on stage. The role of Ingmar Bergman was performed by Finnish movie actor Peter Franzén and American actress Ann Magnuson portrayed the role of Greta Garbo. The show was held at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. The group showcased at the film festival in their quest for funding for the feature film version. The performance garnered glowing reviews from journals such as The Huffington Post, the LA Times, the LA Weekly, and LA Record.\n\nSince 2011, the band have been pursuing the idea of turning The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman into a feature film. Originally envisaged as a live-action film, in 2017, the Mael Brothers announced they were taking a new direction and developing Bergman as an animated feature film with director Joseph Wallace, who created the music video for their track \"Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)\".\n\n2010s\nIn 2010, Sparks remixed Yoko Ono's song \"Give Me Something\". In July they contributed a remix of sorts to singer Katie Melua's single, A Happy Place, calling it Sparks VS. Melua. September 2 marked the debut of the new theme songs that Ron and Russell have composed and recorded for NPR radio's Bookworm show, broadcast in Los Angeles on station KCRW. The two songs mark the first time in 21 years that the Bookworm show has used a new theme song, these being commissioned by show host and Sparks fan Michael Silverblatt. The compositions were entitled \"Where Would We Be Without Books?\" and \"I Am A Bookworm\".\n\nFor the encore of what may have been the final live date ever in America for Faith No More on December 1 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Ron and Russell Mael were invited by Mike Patton and Co. to perform the Sparks' classic hit \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". They reprised the song that also appears as a collaboration with Faith No More on Sparks' 1997 album Plagiarism and had also been released as a single.\n\nIn 2012 Ron and Russell collaborated with singer Gemma Ray who released a limited 12-inch single titled \"Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks)\", which included Ray's covers of Sparks' \"How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall\" and \"Eaten by the Monster of Love\". Though the songs were covers sung by Ray, they were arranged and produced by the Maels. In October, Ron and Russell performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled \"Two Hands One Mouth\" began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the Coachella Festival. A short US tour with shows in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia followed. In May 2013 Ron and Russell played the show in Paris, France, which coincided with their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. In Paris, they were joined on stage by Catherine Ringer from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration \"Singing in The Shower\".\n\nSparks first live album, Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe was released in 2013. It contains concert recordings gathered from various cities during the October 2012 European tour. In Fall Ron and Russell continued touring in the duo format for a second round. The tour was titled \"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth\". The two-and-a-half-month tour started with shows in the US and Canada. Sparks played in Los Angeles (The Fonda Theatre), New York City (Webster Hall), Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Mountain Oasis Electronic Summit in Asheville, Atlanta, Boston, Washington D.C. (9:30 Club), Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, and Pontiac. The tour then continued to Europe, where they played three nights at Union Chapel in London (where Thurston Moore (ex-Sonic Youth joined them to play guitar on \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" on one of the nights), as well as additional shows in the UK, Switzerland, France, Spain, and Sweden.\n\nBoth \"Two Hands One Mouth\" and \"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth\" tours were critically well received.\n\nIn 2013 they contributed a song and brief voice part to the Guy Maddin movie The Forbidden Room.\n\nIn February 2014 it was announced the Sparks (Ron and Russell) are working on material with Franz Ferdinand.\n\n2014 marked the 40th Anniversary of Sparks' most popular and most influential album, Kimono My House. They performed the album in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London on 19 and 20 December. The album was performed with the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra. The show included a second-half consisting of songs from Sparks' entire career, that were also orchestrated for the show. The first night sold out within the first few hours. On the second night, they announced that they had completed the recording of their new album. Ron and Russell took the Kimono My House celebrations to Los Angeles as they performed the album on two consecutive nights with a 38-piece orchestra at the United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel Los Angeles on Valentine's Day 14 February and on 15 February 2015. The orchestra was conducted by Suzie Katayama. Both shows sold out and they received glowing reviews. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand joined them on stage for duet with Russell on the song \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way on both nights and it was then announced that Sparks and FF had joined forces to form a new, then yet-to-be-revealed band and to record an album.\n\nIn the fall of 2015 the title track from Angst in My Pants was used in a commercial for men's underwear by retailer Tommy John. The ad was titled \"The Big Adjustment\" and depicted men, from various walks of life, attempting to secretly adjust their ill-fitting underwear to humorous effect.\n\nFFS (2015)\n\nOn March 9, 2015, it was announced that the band had formed a supergroup with Franz Ferdinand under the name FFS. A short teaser of the FFS song, \"The Power Couple\", was released on the group's YouTube channel. The alternative meaning behind the band's name \"Franz Ferdinand / Sparks\" was confirmed with a clip of the musicians playing the \"Chinese Whispers\" (game). It was also confirmed that the band would be releasing a studio album in 2015 with producer John Congleton and that the band would be touring in the summer. On April 1, it was announced that the group's new album would be titled FFS and that it would be released on June 8 in the UK and on June 9 in the US. They are featured on the Beck album Song Reader doing an ethereal rendition of his song \"Why Did You Make Me Care\". Recently, they performed on the Glastonbury Festival John Peel Stage, 28 June 2015.\n\nHippopotamus (2017)\n\nOn March 24, 2017, Sparks performed at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Glasgow, Scotland, prior to the release of a new studio album, Hippopotamus due out in September. The band, consisting of the Mael brothers with 5 other musicians, kicked off their 2017 tour in Copenhagen on August 7. Hippopotamus was both a critical and commercial success, peaking at number 7 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nIn 2019, Sparks collaborated with and were featured on French artist Sebastian's album, Thirst on the track, \"Handcuffed to a Parking Meter\". In July, the band Sparks announced that they were working on a new album. \"Please Don't Fuck Up My World\", the first single, was released in December.\n\n2020s\n\nA Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (2020)\nIn January 2020, Sparks announced the upcoming release of their new album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, comprising 14 songs. A UK and European tour was scheduled for October. The single \"Self-Effacing\", was released in February followed by \"I'm Toast\" in March. The album had its digital release on May 15, 2020, with the physical release pushed back to July 3, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; like its predecessor, Hippopotamus, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7 and garnered universal critical acclaim. Coinciding with the physical release of the album, an official music video for the song \"The Existential Threat\" premiered on YouTube, the animation created by English freelance animator and composer Cyriak Harris. The band then collaborated with Todd Rundgren on the single \"Your Fandango\", 50 years after he produced their debut album.\n\nAnnette, The Sparks Brothers and tour (2021-present)\nSparks were involved in two 2021 film releases, as screenwriters and composers for the musical Annette, directed by Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and in The Sparks Brothers, a documentary about their career directed by Edgar Wright. Annette premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was in competition for the Palme d'Or. The leading track \"So May We Start\" was accompagned by a video featuring the band with Driver and Cotillard, and the Annette soundtrack was released on Sony.\n\nThe band have announced that they will be on tour in North America, in the UK and in Europe in 2022. This will be their longest US tour for decades. The 2022 European tour will consist mainly of concerts postponed in 2020 and 2021. In February Sparks played two sold-out shows at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, their first full concerts since 2018. Variety lauded the concert as \"a rousingly celebratory homecoming\",\n\nAt the 2022 Césars which is France's equivalent to the Oscars, the band received a Cesar for best original music for Annette.\n\nStyle\nSparks is generally regarded as an art pop band.\nTheir musical style has varied dramatically with Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice (in particular his far-reaching falsetto) and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style being the common thread throughout their fifty-year career. In its review of Kimono My House, NME described Russell's falsetto as a \"stratospheric blend of Marc Bolan and Tiny Tim\". In the beginning, they attempted to emulate the sound of their English idols, such as the Who, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and the Kinks, sometimes even pretending to be an English band while on the LA club circuit. They relocated to England during the glam rock era where, despite cutting an odd figure on this scene, they found success with their polished brand of intricate pop tunes and convoluted lyrics. Early albums such as Kimono My House combined glam rock with elements of bubblegum pop and baroque music. By the second half of the decade, they were concerned that the sound they had developed while based in England was in danger of becoming stale; they returned to LA, determined to adopt a more \"West Coast\" sound. This they achieved with producer Rupert Holmes on Big Beat and (sans Holmes) on Introducing Sparks.\n\nThe band were not satisfied with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2002, the band switched to a classically influenced art pop style with the release of their album Lil' Beethoven, replacing the beat-driven synth-pop of their previous albums with complex orchestral arrangements. The band acknowledged this change in style on the album's opening track \"The Rhythm Thief\".\n\nLyrically, the band's style has been described as coming from \"the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre\". Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On \"My Baby's Taking Me Home\" of Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, \"Your Call Is Very Important To Us\", uses a corporation style call-hold message: \"Your call is very important to us.  Please hold\" which is then sung with some additional words: \"At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold.\" The only other lyrics in the song are \"Red light\", \"Green light\", \"I'm Getting Mixed Signals\" and \"Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold\". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.\n\nThe vocal sound on the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" was criticised as being \"stylised\". This may be because the song was written without any regard for the vocal style of Russell Mael. Ron Mael has explained:\n\n\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" was written in A, and by God, it'll be sung in A. I just feel that if you're coming up with most of the music, then you have an idea where it's going to go. And no singer is gonna get in my way.\n\nRussell Mael has claimed in reply:\n\nWhen he wrote \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", Ron could only play it in that key. It was so much work to transpose the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a \"rock\" voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about \"guts\". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.\n\nLegacy\nSparks has influenced many later genres including synth-pop, new wave, post-punk, and alternative music, influencing a wide range of singers and bands including  Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sonic Youth and Björk.\n\nSteve Jones of the Sex Pistols said that he constantly listened to Kimono My House back in 1974 at Paul Cook's room. \"We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them\".  Joy Division cited \"Number One Song in Heaven\" as a primary influence during the recording of \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\". Joy Division's drummer Stephen Morris stated: \"When we were doing 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', there were two records we were into: Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits and Number One Song in Heaven by Sparks. That was the beginning of getting interested in Giorgio Moroder\". Peter Hook of New Order cited Moroder's production on \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" as a major influence when his band changed musical style to produce electro/dance-rock songs like \"Temptation\" in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of \"When I'm With You\" that same year in Milano. When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan and composer Martin Gore of Depeche Mode cited them as one of their favorite bands. Gore also later covered \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" on his Counterfeit e.p. in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League, and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about \"This Town ain't...\": \"There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song.\"\n\nSparks have also been name-checked by indie pop band the Smiths. Their singer Morrissey named Kimono My House as one of \"his favourite LPs of all time\". Smiths' guitarist and composer Johnny Marr said : \"There's nothing better than commerciality crossed with an interesting mind\" and named \"This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us\" as an instance, qualifying it as one of these \"Trojan singles\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a version of the first Sparks' success as the opening song of their covers album Through the Looking Glass. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth also included the Sparks' song \"Equator\" in his list of all-time favorite songs. Joey Ramone also mentioned his liking for their records, as did later the group They Might Be Giants. Devo's singer Mark Mothersbaugh described himself as a big \"Ron Mael fan\" and of his look: \"it was so not rock n' roll, in an unexpected way, that you just couldn't help but think that there was something there\". He also listened to Kimono my House during his formative years.\n\nBjörk talked about Kimono my House as one of the records that changed her life. \"[Sparks] were exotic [...], [they] were the most refreshing thing in my life\" when she was eight. \"I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people\". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: \"I saw Sparks play on American Bandstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled,  \"why I love the Sparks\". He said about their music: \"It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then you really fall in love and bands change your life.

Electronic band Justice hailed the group saying: \"this is [...] something we like in music, this kind of epic feeling, [...] and we were really inspired by bands like Sparks [...] who have this really operatic sound\". In 2012, synth-pop duo Spray released the song \"Sparks Called and They Want Their Ideas Back\".\n\nIn 1980 Paul McCartney also gave a nod to the band in the music video for \"Coming Up\" in which he appeared mimicking Ron Mael on keyboards.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Cannes Soundtrack Award\n| 2021\n| Annette\n| Best Composer\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Florida Film Critics Circle\n| 2021\n| Annette\n| Best Score\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|César Awards\n| 2022\n| Annette\n| Best Original Music\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Lumières Awards\n| 2022\n| Annette\n| Best Music\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|NME Awards\n| 2022\n| The Sparks Brothers\n| Best Music Film\n| \n|\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n Halfnelson (1971, reissued as Sparks, 1972)\n A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing (1973)\n Kimono My House (1974)\n Propaganda (1974)\n Indiscreet (1975)\n Big Beat (1976)\n Introducing Sparks (1977)\n No. 1 in Heaven (1979)\n Terminal Jive (1980)\n Whomp That Sucker (1981)\n Angst in My Pants (1982)\n In Outer Space (1983)\n Pulling Rabbits Out of a Hat (1984)\n Music That You Can Dance To (1986)\n Interior Design (1988)\n Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins (1994)\n Plagiarism (1997)\n Balls (2000)\n Lil' Beethoven (2002)\n Hello Young Lovers (2006)\n Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008)\n The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009)\n Hippopotamus (2017)\n A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (2020)\n Annette (2021, soundtrack)\n\nLive album\n Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe (2012)\n\nCollaborative albums\n FFS (2015) (with Franz Ferdinand as FFS)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n\n1972 establishments in California\nAmerican glam rock musical groups\nIsland Records artists\nMusical groups established in 1972\nMusical groups from Los Angeles\nSibling musical duos\nArt pop musicians\nAmerican synth-pop groups\nSynth-pop new wave musical groups\nColumbia Records artists\nVirgin Records artists\nElektra Records artists\nGut Records artists\nBertelsmann Music Group artists\nRCA Records artists\nAtlantic Records artists\nBearsville Records artists\nIn the Red artists\nAmerican expatriates in the United Kingdom\nAmerican expatriates in France", "machine_text": " Sparks are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1970 by brothers Ron (the lead guitarist, vocals, kazoo, piano,organ) and Russell Mael (the lead vocalist, keyboards, guitar, drums, percussion) with the intention of doing experimental pop music. The band's current line-up consists of the Mael brothers and drummer Steve Durand, with various bassists and programmers in rotation. Since the band's formation, they have released twenty studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles and music videos. The band came to international attention in 1974 with the release of their second studio album, Kimono My House, which featured their first hit single, \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". The song was among the first to feature a disability-related theme, and it reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. The album's title track was also a hit, reaching the top ten in the United States and Canada. The band's next album, Big Beat (1976), featured two more UK top ten hits, \"Never Turn Your Back on a Friend\" and \"Get Crazy\". Their 1978 album, This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us, was their first UK number one. It featured their only UK number one single, \"The Number One Song in Heaven\", and \"Tryouts for the Human Race\", which was the first of their songs to hit the Billboard Hot 100. In the early 1980s, the band's popularity began to wane. They changed their style and became more experimental to catch the interest of the audience. Their 1983 album, Kimono Wars, was a critical and commercial failure. A new direction in 1984 with the release of the album, Music That You Can Dance To, did not lead to a commercial recovery. A series of collaborations with other artists, including \"I Predict (We'll Be Famous)\", with Annie Lennox, helped to keep the band in the public eye. In 1986, the band's contract with Columbia Records expired and they signed with Virgin Records. They began to work on what would become their first major hit album in eight years, Whomp That Sucker. The title track was released as a single and became their biggest hit in the United States since \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". The next year, they had another hit with \"Angst in My Pants\", from the album Luxury Problem. In 1989, they released the album, The Whomp That Sucker Tour, a live album with a studio recording of \"Let's Go to Bed\", which was their final hit. In the early 1990s, the band's popularity began to wane again. They released the album, Angst in My Pants, but it failed to chart. In 1996, they released a greatest hits album, and they have not had a hit since. In 2001, the band released a new album, Lil' Beethoven. They continue to perform and tour, and have released several live albums.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 993683}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Pebble Mine\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Pebble Mine  is the common name of a proposed copper-gold-molybdenum mining project in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska, near Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark. As of November 2020 the mine developer, Northern Dynasty Minerals, was seeking federal permits from the United States Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. State permitting would then follow, which the developer expected to take up to three years. In November 2020, the developer was denied a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permit for its proposed mine discharge plan. On September 9, 2021, it was reported that the EPA had \"asked a federal court to allow for Clean Water Act protections for parts of the bay.\"\n\nBackground\n\nGeography \nThe Pebble prospect is in a remote, wild, and generally uninhabited part of the Bristol Bay watershed. The nearest communities, about  distant, are the villages of Nondalton, Newhalen, and Iliamna. The site is  southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nPebble is approximately  north of, and upstream of, Lake Iliamna. The deposit area is characterized by relatively flat land dotted by glacial ponds, interspersed with isolated mountains or ranges of hills rising one or two thousand feet above the flats. Pebble is under a broad flat valley at about  above sea level dividing the drainages of Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River.\n\nUpper Talarik Creek flows into Lake Iliamna, which flows through the Kvichak River into Bristol Bay. Waters in the Koktuli River drain into the Mulchatna River, a tributary of the Nushagak River which empties into Bristol Bay at Dillingham. Water from Lake Clark, approximately  east of Pebble, flows down the Newhalen River to Lake Iliamna.\n\nGeology\n\nRegional \nThe Kahiltna terrane is interpreted to represent a sediment trough formed on the landward (Alaska) side of the Wrangellia volcanic arc terrane, prior to collision of Wrangellia with Alaska. The Wrangellia and Kahiltna terranes docked to Alaska in the Cretaceous Period. This part of the Kahiltna terrane is dominated by Late Triassic basalt, andesite and sedimentary rocks overlain by Jurassic-Cretaceous andesitic turbidites. Cretaceous granitic intrusive activity was widespread in the Kahiltna terrane. Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and Quaternary glacial deposits, developed over the older rocks.\n\nThe Lake Clark fault, or a splay, probably lies within  of the Pebble deposits and possibly much closer. The fault is a major right-lateral strike-slip crustal feature, considered to be a westward expression of the Castle Mountain fault. The actual ground trace of the fault and its splays are unknown in the Pebble area, due to extensive ground cover. A 2007 report indicates that magnitude 7.1 quakes occur on the fault on a 700-year cycle. The Lake Clark fault several hundred miles to the north is sub-parallel to the Denali fault and considered to be of similar nature. A magnitude 7.9 quake struck the Denali fault in 2002.\nThe subduction zone of the Aleutian Trench lies approximately  south of Pebble. This zone was the source of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake of magnitude 9.2. The Augustine Volcano, which lies 25 miles offshore, last erupted in 2006.\n\nThe ore body \nA contiguous body of ore is known as Pebble West where mineralization locally extends to the surface and as Pebble East where it is deeply buried. Pebble holds mostly low-grade ore, requiring a large-scale operation to economically recover it.\n\nThe Pebble deposit is hosted in porphyritic granodiorite to tonalite of Upper Cretaceous age intruded into deformed sedimentary rocks of the Jurassic to Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch terrane.\n\nThe copper ore is a calc-alkali porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit. The ore body extends from the surface to at least  depth. In the western part of the orebody, mineralization occurs in a complex of several small granodiorite cupolas, diorite sills, older intrusions, breccias, and sediments. The western part of the deposit is locally exposed at the surface; thin gossans are developed and oxidation reaches  in depth. The orebody extends eastward across a fault contact, at depth. East of the fault mineralization occurs in abundant sills and in the intruded sediments. Farther east, and deeper, the sills coalesce into a deeply buried granodiorite pluton. Mineralization and ore continue into the pluton. The eastern part of the deposit was eroded when it was exposed at the surface millions of years ago. It has since been buried by a thickening-to-the-east wedge of post-mineralization-age Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic sedimentary rocks.\n\nMineralization at Pebble is aged from 90.4 ±0.6 MYA to 89.5 ±0.3 MYA.\n\nMetallic minerals identified at Pebble include pyrite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and bornite, along with minor covellite, chalcocite, digenite and magnetite.\n\nResources \nIn 2008, Pebble was estimated to be the second-largest ore deposit of its type in the world in terms of the value of the contained metal, slightly smaller than Indonesia's Grasberg Mine, which contains more metal in a smaller amount of ore than Pebble.\n\nThe last resource estimate for Pebble, as at December 2017, was a measured and indicated resource of 6.46 billion tonnes of ore grading 0.40% copper, 0.34 g/t gold, 1.7 g/t silver and 240 ppm molybdenum. Contained metals in the resource (at 100% recovery) were 56.9 billion pounds of copper, 70.6 million troy ounces of gold, 3.4 billion pounds of molybdenum and 344 million ounces of silver. The estimate used a 0.3% copper equivalent cutoff. \n\nAs of August 2021 gross value of the contained metals, 57% was from copper, and 27% from gold and 14% from molybdenum. Co-products including silver, rhenium, and palladium might also be recoverable.\n\nFisheries \nAll five Eastern Pacific salmon species spawn in Bristol Bay's freshwater tributaries. The bay is home to the world's largest commercial sockeye salmon fishery. The Kvichak River has the world's single largest sockeye run. The Kvichak drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Salmon, herring and other fisheries account for nearly 75% of local jobs.\n\nSport fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater for sport fishermen exploiting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).\n\nSeasonal harvesting of salmon and year-round harvesting of freshwater fish is a critical part of life for rural residents, most of whom live downstream of the mine site.\n\nHuman populations \nThe Pebble site is within Lake and Peninsula Borough, about 1,600 inhabitants as of United States Census, 2010, adjacent to the Bristol Bay Borough of about 1000 inhabitants and the Dillingham Census Area, 4,800 inhabitants. Some 7,500 people live largely rural lifestyles within or near the area downstream of the Pebble site. The populations of Lake Clark National Park and other parts of the Bethel Census Area are upstream of the site or in a different watershed.\n\nThe populations in the area rely heavily on wild resources for subsistence, harvesting moose, caribou and salmon. Wild resources play an important part in the region's cultural heritage. There are more than 30 Alaskan native tribes in the region that depend on salmon to support their traditional subsistence ways of life, in addition to other inhabitants and tourists in the area.\n\nHistory\n\nDiscovery \nIn 1987 Cominco Alaska Exploration (CAE) (which subsequently became Teck Resources) collected mineralized surface samples at the Pebble site from color anomalies visible from aircraft. Geologist Phil St. George was credited with the discovery. He led early exploration efforts, drilling out the first half billion tons of the deposit. The first two exploration holes were drilled in 1988; in 1989 twelve more drill holes, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys indicated that the Pebble West occurrence (originally named Pebble Beach) was part of a large copper porphyry system. CAE continued drilling and other work through 1992, with a second drill campaign in 1997, with the resource doubled from 500M short tons to 1B short tons. \n\nIn 2001, Northern Dynasty Minerals, Ltd. optioned the property from Teck Cominco, the successor to CAE's parent company. Northern Dynasty Minerals began exploration in 2002, which continued through 2013. In 2005, Northern Dynasty discovered the Pebble East deposit and acquired 100% ownership of the Pebble mining claims.\n\nProject funding \n\nIn 2008, $140 million was budgeted and approximately  of additional drilling was completed.\n\nIn 2009, $70 million was budgeted, to complete a preliminary feasibility study, or \"prefeasibility\" study, and to prepare the project for permitting.\n\nIn 2010, $73 million was budgeted towards the pre-feasibility report, environmental studies, and various administrative and community-relations work. Applications for development and operations permits were not planned until after 2010.\n\nFor 2011, $91 million was budgeted to complete the pre-feasibility study, leading to permit applications in 2012. Environmental and engineering studies including  of drilling to decide on mine design and a complete environmental baseline.\n\nProject particulars\n\nProject ownership \nThe land is owned by the State of Alaska. Pebble Mines Corp. holds mineral rights for  of the area, an area that includes the Pebble deposits, as well as other, less explored, mineral deposits. A sequence of mining companies and partnerships have owned the Alaska mining claims at and around Pebble since the initial claim staking by Cominco in 1987.\n\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership was once one of the largest multinational mining corporations made up of South African company Anglo American, along with Northern Dynasty Minerals, a junior mining company headquartered in Canada. After a few investors walked away, Northern Dynasty was the only company left seeking development.\n\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership is now 100% owned by The Northern Dynasty Partnership, which is a wholly owned Canadian-based subsidiary of Northern Dynasty Minerals, Limited.\n\nThree of the world's largest mining companies purchased shares of Northern Dynasty or became partners in the Pebble Limited Partnership through obligations to fund exploration and development. All have since divested their interests.\n\nMitsubishi Corporation sold its 9.1% interest in Northern Dynasty Minerals in 2011.\n\nAnglo American, a South African mining company, struck a deal with Northern Dynasty to earn a 50% interest in a newly created Pebble Limited Partnership, the other 50% belonging to Northern Dynasty; between 2007 and 2013 Anglo American spent over half a billion dollars on the project. In December 2013 Anglo American walked away from the project, losing its 50% interest, which reverted to Northern Dynasty Minerals Limited.\n\nRio Tinto Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Kennecott Utah Copper purchased, for 87 million dollars, a 9.9% ownership of Northern Dynasty Minerals Limited in July, 2006, and in 2007 doubled that to 19.8% ownership, for an additional 94 million dollars. In April 2014, the Rio Tinto Group gifted its shares, worth only approximately 18 million by then, to two Alaskan charitable foundations.\n\nNorthern Dynasty is one of several public mining companies controlled by Hunter Dickinson, a Vancouver-based Canadian mining corporation.\nAll but one of Hunter Dickinson Corporation's board members are also on the Northern Dynasty board. Most of the senior management of Northern Dynasty also hold senior management positions at Hunter Dickinson Corporation.\n\nAs reported on February 13, 2019, Kopernik Global Investors beneficially owns 6.17% of Northern Dynasty Minerals, which is an increase of 11% in their ownership stake from their prior reported position reported in February, 2018. Based on filings, Kopernik has held a position in NAK since at least as early as 2015, when they owned 19.99%.\n\nEconomics \nPebble is the largest known undeveloped copper ore body in the world, measured by either the amount of contained metal or the amount of ore.\n\nA report released by Northern Dynasty in 2011 predicted profits for mine owners from a large-scale open-pit mine at Pebble, given appropriate assumptions about construction costs ($4.7 billion), scale (200,000 tons per day), lifetime (45 years), metal prices over that lifetime (2011 prices) and the mine design plan.\n\nThe study assumed a slurry pipeline would deliver ore concentrate from the mine to a new port on Cook Inlet, and that trucks will haul ore concentrates to Cook Inlet.\n\nThe plan expected the mine to return the initial capital investment in 3.2 years, employ over a thousand people for the first 25 years and provide a lifetime 23.2% pretax internal rate of return. The expected pretax cash flow was approximately $2 billion per year for much of the mine life and significantly more during the later years. The report states that 58% of the ore resource will remain at year 45.\n\nPermits \nNorthern Dynasty has applied for water rights permits to Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River for use in mining. Altogether, Northern Dynasty has applied for rights to about  of ground and surface water per year, about four times the annual throughput of drinking-quality water at the Anchorage Waste and Wastewater Utility.\n\nIn April 2017 Northern Dynasty reported that it had received notice of approval of a Miscellaneous Land Use Permit from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for ongoing activities at Pebble.\n\nStudies \n\nSite-specific baseline data and scientific studies of potential environmental and social effects have been and are being conducted by the project operators and their consultants. These studies address water quality and other concerns. Among these are: \n quantification of Acid mine drainage - the chemical stability and weathering products of the tailings (waste rock, which would be wet-stacked without dewatering) generated by the mine, as well as of the newly exposed and blast-fractured rocks within the proposed mine.\n seismic risks to the impoundment systems (earthen tailings dams) designed to contain the tailings and intended to control their chemical behavior in perpetuity.\n the effects of road and bridge construction on fish habitat.\n\nPublic interest in the project has also resulted in outside, and opposing, interests publishing scientific reviews of available data and comparisons with other projects. These include reports or summaries on the following: acid rock drainage, effects of roads and bridges on fish (roads supporting the Pebble mine could cross 20 known salmon streams), and general water pollution-related concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began conducting a scientific review of the Bristol Bay watershed in 2011 focused on the Nushagak and Kvichak river drainages, in response to petitions from tribes, commercial fishing organizations, and other organizations opposed to Pebble. The agency completed the review in 2014. See Legal challenges.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) released its final Environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Pebble Mine project in July 2020, concluding that the project would not lead to \"long-term changes in the health of the commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay,\" under normal conditions. After a preliminary draft of this final statement was sent to federal and state agencies, many other scientific and administrative groups critiqued this conclusion. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that the EIS did not consider habitat destruction that could lead to destruction of salmon stocks in Bristol Bay. The legal director of Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit public interest law firm, indicated that the report was \"lacking and thoroughly inadequate.\"\n\nPossible mining plan \nThe mine itself would be an open-pit mine a mile square in area and a third of a mile deep. Ponds would be dammed to contain tailing, including some toxic materials. A 165-mile natural gas pipeline would be constructed to provide power for the operation, as well as 80 miles of road and pipeline to transport the mined concentrate to Cook Inlet. Operating the mine would use and impound large amounts of surface water. The roads would carry fuel, industrial chemicals and supplies.\n\nPebble East would most likely be an underground mine.\n\nPebble would be similar to existing large copper porphyry mines such as Chuquicamata, Bingham Canyon and Ok Tedi, although the environmental setting and various technical considerations of Pebble distinguish it from these desert and tropical examples. Development and construction would consume years and cost billions of dollars. Required infrastructure includes miles of roads, bridges and power lines with pipelines for fuel and rock slurries.\n\nDesign possibilities include: construction of a port on Iniskin Bay of Cook Inlet with a two-lane freight road roughly  long built along the north side of Lake Iliamna between the mine and the new port; trucks hauling ore concentrate to the port; pipelines along the road to carry fuel to the mine and a slurry of metal concentrate to the port. The slurry would be dewatered at the port before being shipped to a smelter, with a pipeline returning the water to the mine. Power to operate the mine would possibly come from a combination of overhead power lines and a submarine cable across Cook Inlet.\n\nFeasibility studies (detailed mine construction and operation plans) were prepared by Pebble Mines Corp. The company expected to apply for permits in 2012 at the earliest.\n\nProject timeline \n2010: Nine Bristol Bay Tribes, commercial fishermen, and sportsmen requested the EPA conduct a Section 404c Environmental Assessment study under the Clean Water Act. EPA describes the study process: \"Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in water of the United States (including wetlands) whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that use of such sites for disposal would have an unacceptable adverse impact on one or more of various resources, including fisheries, wildlife, municipal water supplies, or recreational areas.\"\n\n2012: EPA issued two drafts of the Environmental Assessment, concluding that the proposal for the Pebble Mine would negatively impact the Bristol Bay salmon. The public strongly agreed, with over 1 million comments supporting the EPA’s findings and scientists further verifying the data.\n\n2013: The Alaska DNR signed and adapted a Determination of Reclassification and Plan Amendment to the Bristol Bay Area Plan. This plan increased the amount of land classified Wildlife Habitat and Public Recreation in the region.\n\nThe final Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment (BBWA) was released, confirming that the Pebble Mine could not be operated without impacting Bristol Bay and harming salmon. In September 2013 Anglo American, one of the first and major investors in Pebble, withdrew from the project.\n\n2014: Rio Tinto gifted its stake in the project to the Alaska Community Foundation and the Bristol Bay Native Corporation Education Foundation.\n\n2015: EPA released its Proposed Determination suggesting to limit mining in the Bristol Bay region due to the irreversible and detrimental impacts it would have on the local salmon ecosystem. After its release, 89.5% of the country was in support of strong protections for Bristol Bay.\n\n2016: The Inspector General came out in support of the EPA’s Watershed Assessment findings, ultimately encouraging limiting mining due to its unavoidable impact on the salmon wildlife in Bristol Bay, affecting both the natural ecosystem and the economic wellbeing of the area.\n\n2017: After a meeting between the EPA administration and the CEO of Northern Dynasty (developers for the Pebble Project), litigations are settled and the EPA agrees to begin proceedings to withdrawal the Proposed Determination act. Developers move forward with a plan for permits. In July, after the EPA proposes to withdrawal Proposed Determination, the Pebble Limited Partnership submits permits to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the key agency in charge of reviewing the permit, laid out in a 3-4 timeline. EPA decided to not withdraw the BBWA.\n\n2018: Due to increased input of concerns for the Bristol Bay fishery because of Pebble Project, EPA decides to suspend withdrawal of Proposed Determination. USACE decides to gather more information regarding the impact to area's fish and natural resources.\n\n2019: EPA submits comments to the USACE Environmental Impact Statement saying that the document underestimates the environmental impacts. More than 700,000 comments are posted in opposition to the Pebble Project. Later, the Proposed Determination is revoked, saying the five-year old document does not fully consider all information, including the Pebble Limited Partnership's project plan and the additional information considered during the USACE permit process.\n\n2020: In July, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found in a final environmental analysis that the operation of a Pebble Mine \"would not be expected to have a measurable effect on fish numbers\" in the Bristol Bay watershed. In November the Corps denied the project a permit for its discharge plan, required under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. In 2020, while campaigning for the presidency of the US, Joe Biden stated the location was \"no place for a mine.\" In January 2021, Northern Dynasty Minerals  submitted an appeal to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decision. \n\n2021: On September 9, 2021, it was reported that the EPA, calling the bay an \"Alaskan treasure,\" had \"asked a federal court to allow for Clean Water Act protections for parts of the bay. If the court agrees, the agency could move forward with designing long-term protections for the bay.\" The EPA restoring protections would, according to the Washington Post, essentially block the mine project. Apparently, the EPA had only used authority under \"Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to block a major project only a dozen other times.\" Before implemented, the decision awaiting signing off by the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, potentially a several month process.\n\nReactions \nThe proposed Pebble mine centers poses a potential risk to the watershed, salmon and other fisheries. Mining opponents claim that the mine poses a significant and unacceptable risk to downstream fish stocks, and could cause an environmental disaster if built. Mining proponents claim that the mine can be developed and operated without significantly harming Bristol Bay area fish.\n\nA steady stream of electoral, legislative, and legal challenges to possible future Pebble mine development are lodged in Alaska. Some of these assert that even the drilling and other scientific investigations conducted to date have caused significant adverse effects to the land and wildlife near the Pebble site.\n\nPebble has been a major issue in Alaska politics since the mid-2000s; national environmental and sport-fishing organizations are involved, while national publications cover the issue.\n\nThe New York Times reports that, as of 2020, public opinion polls in Alaska indicate more opposition than support for the mine. In the local area near the proposed mine location, anti-mine sentiment is even stronger. In 2006 one poll reported 28% of Alaskans in favor of and 53% opposed to Pebble and another reported 45% of Alaskans in favor and 31% in opposition. A poll of Bristol Bay residents reported 20% in favor and 71% opposed. Fifty-seven percent of Alaskan voters in a 2008 statewide election voted against a ballot measure that would have essentially outlawed the project and perhaps similar developments elsewhere in Alaska.\n\nOrganizations including the Resource Development Council, Alaska Mining Association, and the Alaska Chamber of Commerce support the project. The proposal has strong support among statewide elected officials.\n\nOpposition to the proposal was led by organizations including; the Renewable Resources Coalition (formed in 2005 to oppose the Pebble project), local native groups (such as the Bristol Bay Native Association), commercial and sport fishing organizations (such as the Alaska Independent Fishermen's Marketing Association and the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism Association), and conservationist groups (such as American Rivers and Trout Unlimited). Deceased Senator Ted Stevens, a strong proponent of other resource extraction projects, in 2007 expressed opposition to the Pebble proposal.\n\nIn April 2009, a Native delegation from the Bristol Bay region attended the annual shareholder's meeting of Anglo American, the major mining company behind the Pebble project. The delegation met with Cynthia Carroll, CEO of Anglo American, claiming that the Bristol Bay watershed is no place for an open-pit mine.\n\nMultiple UK jewelers pledged not to buy gold from the Pebble mine if it is built, joining several American jewelry retailers and manufacturers who had done the same in 2008.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other well known groups and figures (such as actor Robert Redford) have opposed the construction of the mine. In an effort to stop or pause the construction of the mine, the NRDC has created a petition that now has more than a million signatures. The environmental justice nonprofit, Earthworks, has more than 100 gold buyers who have agreed to boycott gold from the Pebble Mine. These retailers include Tiffany & Co, Jostens, and Zales, along with others.\n\nArguments against the proposal \n Opponents to the mine point out that it is about jobs—current sustainable fishing (world class fishery with long history and that is perpetually sustainable) versus the time-limited mining employment that the mine will generate.  (All mines have limited lifespans.) \n The fish in the watershed, and the wildlife that depend on them, are too important to risk in exchange for the mine's economic benefits. (Bristol Bay is the most valuable Sockeye Salmon fishery in the world —  employing more than 14,000 people and generating $1.5 billion in annual profit.)\n Accidental discharge of process chemicals and byproducts, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage to the environment are concerns in mine design and operation.  Heavy metals are mobilized by acids.  Downstream salmon and freshwater fish species are vulnerable to mine-generated pollutants.  A threat to the fisheries would amount to a threat to the regional subsistence lifestyle.\n Hard-rock mining already has a notable track record in terms of the permanent and costly legacy of heavy-metal-laden acidic leachate that continuously flows from inactive, depleted old mine sites. According to the EPA, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40 percent of watersheds in the western continental U.S., and reclamation of 500,000 abandoned mines in 32 states could cost tens of billions of dollars.\n A recent study of 25 modern large hard-rock metal mines compared water quality outcomes with environmental impact statement (EIS) predictions from the permitting stage. 76 percent (19 mines) of the 25 mines violated water quality standards in releases to either surface or groundwater. In this study \"violated water quality standards\" does not necessarily mean that the mines failed to abide by their permits. When the 15 mines with high-acid drainage, high-contaminant leaching potential and proximity to ground water are considered separately, this number is 93% (14 mines).\n A report commissioned by opponents criticizes for community, worker safety, public health, and environmental problems at their mining operations in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Mali, Ireland, and Nevada and notes the difference between the previous owner's stated corporate goals and their actual corporate performance. (Anglo American gave up on Pebble Project due to environmental concerns; these concerns remain under the subsequent owners of the project.)\n\nEconomic \nDue to Alaska's tax structure, oil and gas drilling returns over 20% of resource value to the state and municipalities, fishing returns 1% to 5%, and mining returns approximately 1.5%. However, considering the mine contains over $500 billion in resources, this 1.5% tax amounts to a maximum of $7.5 Billion in tax revenue over the course of the mine's operation or $166 million/year or some four times the commercial tax budget in 2011 ($43 million). The annual revenue potential of the mine is yet unknown, and consequently so is the tax revenue to the State.\n\nArguments for the proposal\n\nEconomic \n The mine and supporting activities would provide significant tax revenue to the state. The State of Alaska predicts that direct mining tax revenue, even without Pebble, will be one of the most important sources of non-oil tax revenue (exceeding revenue from fishing).\n The mine will create well-paying jobs in an increasingly poverty-stricken region—a 2007 estimate indicated roughly 2,000 jobs for construction, dropping to 1,000 permanent jobs during the 30- to 60-year expected lifespan of the mine. However, the current expected mine life has been decreased to 20 years following changes to the development plan in 2018.  Also, the recent and well-documented trend towards automation of mining means that actual employment figures will be substantially lower than those quoted in 2007.  Automation of mines will further increase in the future.\n The mine would provide a domestic resource of raw materials lowering the United States reliance on foreign sources.\n\nEnvironmental \n Protection of the environment and fisheries will be ensured by the stringent environmental review and permitting process, including an EIS, that is required before development is allowed.\n Much of the poor environmental track record of mining occurred before current technologies and regulations.\n Northern Dynasty has a \"no net loss\" policy for fisheries.\n\nSecretly taped conversations\nIn September 2020, the media reported that an environmental activist group, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an international NGO, while posing as potential investors in the mine had secretly taped conversations with Roland Thiessen, chief executive of Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Tom Collier, chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership. During the conversations Collier and Thiessen detailed their plans to gain the favor of elected politicians from Juneau to Washington, D.C. While the USACE had previously decided that the mine would have \"no measurable effect\" on fish populations, in August it informed Pebble Limited Partnership that they had to do more to show how they would offset the damage caused by the mining operation. The Washington Post wrote, \"...but even as the executives jump through several regulatory hoops, [...] they detailed their plan to manage all the decision-makers.\"\n\nThe Post wrote, \"Thiessen described both of the state’s senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as politicians who might make noises about the project to appear sensitive to environmental concerns but ultimately won’t stand in their way.\"  Referring to the letter the Corps issued in August, Collier was taped saying both senators had misinterpreted the letter and feeling \"embarrassed\" were \"[now] just sort of sitting over in a corner and being quiet, okay?”  Learning of the tapes, Murkowski responded, \"Let me be clear: I did not misunderstand the Army Corps’ recent announcement.  I am not 'embarrassed' by my statement on it, and I will not be 'quiet in the corner.' I am dead set on a high bar for large-scale resource development in the Bristol Bay watershed. The reality of this situation is the Pebble project has not met that bar and a permit cannot be issued to it.\" Sullivan also responded saying, \"Any suggestion otherwise is either wishful thinking, a blatant mischaracterization, or a desperate attempt to secure funding for a mine that cannot move forward. This incident demonstrates how far Mr. Collier, who has serious credibility problems of his own, is floundering in the face of this project’s overwhelming challenges.\"  \n\nThe Post wrote that the tapes also revealed that Thiessen suggested that while the company was seeking a 20 year permit he outlined how it could last another 160 years. \"Once you have something like this in production why would you want to stop?\" In an interview, Senator Martin Heinrich said the tape raises questions about whether Pebble Mine officials misled Congress, saying, \"it really calls into question whether they were lying to Congress or not, which is a crime.\" In an interview, the executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency said, \"Seeing that the private opinion of that company that their massive plans will be unstoppable once the first artificially sized permit is passed, that is critical information for the public to know before the final decision is made because it clearly may have permanent impacts on an almost priceless resource for Alaska.\" Following the release of the tapes, Collier put in his resignation.\n\nThis controversy has impacted the 2020 United States Senate election in Alaska, during which Dan Sullivan is up for re-election. This recording and his campaign contributions from the Pebble Mine corporation has led observers to question the sincerity of his opposition to the project, potentially benefiting his political opponent Al Gross.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nEPA action \nOn December 18, 2009, an appeal was filed in Alaska Superior Court contending that a decision in November 2009 by the Alaska DNR commissioner rejecting their challenge of a 2009 exploration permit was inappropriate. The suit contended that DNR failed to give Alaskans adequate notice and opportunity to comment on the permit and that it failed to consider the appeal. Trustees for Alaska is pursuing the suit for Nunamta Aulukestai and two Bristol Bay residents.\n\nIn April 2013, EPA issued a draft assessment of the impact of proposed mining plans on the fisheries, wildlife and Alaska native tribes in the region.\n\nIn January 2014, EPA released its final assessment. It questioned the future of salmon habitat should the mine be opened, but the agency did not use its authority to stop the mine. Pebble Partnership CEO John Shively severely criticized the EPA assessment, saying it was unscientific and that it sought a predetermined outcome. A few days after the release, Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Begich openly opposed the mine, breaking with the other members of the Alaska congressional delegation, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and Republican Representative Don Young.\n\nIn July 2014, before the project had submitted its EIS, EPA's Region 10 office proposed restrictions pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, restrictions that would effectively prohibit the project. This was the twelfth time the clause had been employed since the Act's passage in 1972.\n\nOn July 18, 2014, in a published statement, Pebble Partnership CEO Tom Collier said that the project would continue its litigation against EPA; noted that the EPA's action was under investigation by the Office of the EPA Inspector General and by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and also noted that two bills were pending in the US House and Senate seeking to clarify that EPA did not have the authority to preemptively veto or otherwise restrict development projects prior to the onset of federal and state permitting. Collier's statement also said that EPA's proposal was based on outdated mining scenarios that were not part of the project's approach.\n\nIn May 2017 the Pebble Partnership and EPA jointly announced they had reached a settlement agreement to end the legal dispute regarding the EPA's Proposed Determination issued under CWA 404(c) in July 2014. The Agreement called for the EPA to withdraw the regulatory action while the Pebble Partnership agreed to terminate outstanding lawsuits brought against the EPA.\n\nIn July 2017, the EPA sought comments on a proposal to withdraw its objections to the Pebble Mine based on the 1974 Clean Water Act.\n\nIn February 2018, the EPA changed plans to withdraw restrictions on the Pebble Mine on the basis of the Clean Water Act. Instead, Administrator Pruitt offered support of the fishery. The decision is not final and is open to further public comments.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, the EPA withdrew its preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.\n\nNondalton Tribal Council et al. v. State of Alaska DNR \nSix federally recognized tribes filed Nondalton Tribal Council et al. v. State of Alaska DNR with the Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District) on May 5, 2009. The suit challenged the validity of the 2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan, one of many Area Plans created and administered by the State of Alaska that, along with other State and Federal rules, define land status and the appropriate and legal uses of State land within the plan boundaries.\n\nThe Bristol Bay Area Plan (BBAP) applies to about  of state-owned uplands and lands beneath rivers and lakes in the Bristol Bay drainages, including lands at and in the vicinity of the proposed mine. The plan also covers about  of state-owned tide and submerged lands.\n\nThe suit alleged that the 2005 BBAP, which replaced the original 1984 version, drastically altered, without legal justification, the land-use designations, classifications and acreages defined in the 1984 plan; and that the 2005 plan failed to provide adequate protection for subsistence resources, sport hunting and fishing, wildlife habitat and other renewable resources. If successful, the suit will require ADNR to write a new area plan, a many months-long process involving much public input and review of draft versions, although ultimately, approval of an area plan is decided by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, an appointee of the Governor. As of Aug. 7, 2009, DNR had not filed an answer to the complaint.\n\nNunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR \nNunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR, was filed in Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District) on July 29, 2009, by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Bristol Bay Native organization Nunamta Aulukestai, former Alaska First Lady Bella Hammond, original Alaska Constitutional Convention delegate Victor Fischer and other individuals. The suit seeks \"Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,\" asserting that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources repeatedly violated Section VIII of the Alaska Constitution, which specifically provides that there shall be, \"...no disposals or leases of state lands...without prior public notice and other safeguards of the public's interest...\"\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, an injunction voiding the project's existing permits, including water-use permits. The requested injunction was specific to Pebble permits and would not directly apply to other mining projects. The suit alleges that DNR's \"pattern of permitting,\" is defective because it was not sufficiently rigorous in determining that issuing a permit would best serve public interest, as demonstrated by a lack of documented scientific studies and by lack of public review and input, prior to issuing permits. A Declaration by one of the plaintiffs references the Commentary on Article VIII on State Lands and Natural Resources of December 15, 1955; \"As requirements change and many tasks become routine, appropriate modifications can be made in procedures if rigid requirements are not specified in the Constitution itself.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that significant, and documented, adverse effects on land, water, and wildlife have already occurred as a result of drilling and other exploration activities at Pebble since 1989.  In late 2009 the presiding judge rejected a State of Alaska motion to dismiss the case and also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop mining exploration. A Petition for Review on the preliminary injunction decision was filed with the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nIn July 2010, the Alaska Superior Court ruled that Nunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR would proceed to a non-jury trial in December 2010. The ruling dismissed one of the six claims in the lawsuit and limited the scope of the upcoming trial to the Pebble permits, rather than to the Alaska mineral exploration permitting system in general.\n\nPolitical actions \nTwo bills designed to outlaw large-scale mining in the Pebble area were introduced in the Alaska state legislature in 2007; both stalled in committee. A third attempted (by ballot measure) piece of legislation was the Alaska Clean Water Initiative, 2008. It was voted down after months of high-profile public debate, heavy advertising, and a series of judgements by the Alaska State Supreme Court. The measure remained an active public issue; in June 2009 the state of Alaska's Alaska Public Offices Commission reported violations of campaign funding laws during the contest.\n\nThen-Governor Sarah Palin was a strong supporter of the project and faced criticism about her opposition to the initiative, the involvement of state government and the intended use of a $7 million federal earmark to facilitate it. Ethics questions were raised about her and her husband Todd's participation.\n\nJay Hammond State Game Refuge \nA proposal to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to create a fish refuge in the Koktuli and Talarik watersheds was supported by mine opponents and opposed by Northern Dynasty. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted to create a panel to study the proposal (which could decide to recommend a refuge to the legislature). Both sides claimed this as a victory.  In March 2007 the Board voted to take no action on the proposal due to pending legislation.\n\nIn January, 2007 Senate Bill 67, introduced by Senator Gary Stevens, of Kodiak, proposed the establishment of a State Fish and Game Refuge covering about  of state land in the Kvichak and Nushagak drainages (with the refuge to be named after former Alaska Governor Jay Hammond). It proposed that no uses incompatible with: fish and wildlife populations; commercial or subsistence food gathering; or recreation would be allowed in the refuge. The bill sought to close the refuge to new mining claims. Most significantly, the bill would have made illegal the storage or disposal of any quantity of, \"industrial waste,\" thereby making it impossible to develop any industry, including mines, within the refuge. The bill died in the Senate Resources Committee.\n\nSalmon spawning waters \nIn February 2007, a bill to stop the project by increasing protections for spawning salmon died in the Human Resources committee.\n\n2008 Alaska Clean Water Initiative \n\nIn August 2008, Ballot Measure 4, the \"Alaska Clean Water Initiative,\" was voted down (approximately 57% against and 43% in favor) in that year's primary election. The measure was written to apply statewide (which the Constitution of Alaska demands). Supporters of the Measure argued that it would not affect any other mining operation. Opponents argued that it would have had serious, and unnecessary, adverse effects on the mining industry statewide.\n\nProperty rights \nPebble supporters argued that such bills and measures would constitute an illegal taking of property rights (mineral rights granted by the State of Alaska to holders of mining claims on state land).\n\nSee also\n Proposed Twin Metals mine (Ely, MN)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nGovernment links\n Pebble Project - Alaska Division of Mining, Land & Water\n\nOpposition\n Renewable Resources Coalition\n Renewable Resources Foundation\n Bristol Bay Native Corporation\n Nunamta Aulukestai-Caretakers of the Land\n Bristol Bay Residents Who Oppose the Mine\n Save Bristol Bay\n Our Bristol Bay\n Alaska Trekking \n \n\nProponents\n Northern Dynasty Minerals\n The Pebble Partnership\n Northern Dynasty (NAK) Institutional Investors\n\nPebble education and information \n PebbleWatch - a Project of Bristol Bay Native Corporation's Land Department\n Pebble Science - Objective Scientific Information on the Proposed Pebble Mine\n Great Deposits – Alaska’s Pebble Copper-Gold Deposit, Geology and history, updated  October 17, 2019\n\nNews\n\"Alaska Gold\" video documentary July 2012 from PBS Frontline \n \n \n \n UPI: (April 6, 2008) \"Alaska's Pebble Mine worries biologist\"\n Seattle Times: (Feb. 12, 2008) \"Jewelers oppose Alaska mine\"\n Peninsula Clarion: (Feb. 13, 2008) \"Major jewelers oppose Pebble\"\n \n Anchorage Daily News: (March 18, 2009)\"Spending on Pebble prospect falls this year\"\n National Jeweler: (April 7, 2009)\"Alaska gold mine fight heads to London\"\n National Jeweler: (April 14, 2009) \"UK jewelers join boycott of proposed Alaska mine\"\n Homer News: (April 15, 2009) \"Leading UK jewelers say 'no' to Pebble\"\n Homer Tribune: (April 29, 2009) \"Where's 'fault' in Pebble prospect?\"\n \n Anchorage Daily News: (July 29, 2009) Coalition sues to block Pebble mine permits\"\n\nGold mines in the United States\nCopper mines in the United States\nBuildings and structures in Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska\nMines in Alaska", "machine_text": " Pebble Mine is the common name of a mineral exploration project located in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska, near Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark, that was being considered for development as an open-pit gold and molybdenum mine. The proposal was controversial, because the mine would have been located near the headwaters of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery, the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world, and the proposed mining method would have also disturbed a large area of the Earth's crust, possibly leading to earthquakes. The Pebble Partnership, a consortium of Canadian mining companies, proposed the project. The Pebble Mine site is located about 200 miles (320 km) southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. It encompasses 2,600 acres (11 km2) of the Alaska Peninsula, which juts westward from the mainland to form the southern boundary of Cook Inlet. The nearest communities are Tyonek to the southwest, and Soldotna to the northeast. The mine site is located about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Lake Iliamna, which is fed by the Neacola, Pedro, and Kvichak rivers. The proposed mine site is located on the northern flank of a mountain called Nuyakuk. In 2007, the Pebble Partnership submitted a \"Notice of Intent\" to the US Army Corps of Engineers, stating their intention to develop the mine. In February 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the Pebble deposit as a \"proposed action\", and began an environmental impact assessment of the project. The EPA's assessment was expected to take several years. In September 2013, the Pebble Partnership voluntarily suspended its permit applications while it re-evaluated the project. In June 2017, the Pebble Partnership officially withdrew its permit applications. In November 2020, the EPA proposed to withdraw the proposed action status from the project, removing it from the EPA's list of projects for which it is actively considering a proposed withdrawal of a permit or license. The EPA stated that the decision was not a final decision on the project, and that the EPA would continue to study the project and could still determine that the project would have too much of an impact on the environment. In February 2021, the EPA announced that it would not withdraw the proposed action status from the project, and would instead prepare a supplement to the Bristol Bay Assessment that it had prepared in 2014. The decision was widely expected to lead to a lawsuit from the Pebble Partnership.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 8796651}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Eddy Bruma\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Eduard Johan \"Eddy\" Bruma (May 30, 1925 – November 6, 2000) was a Surinamese politician, lawyer and writer.\n\nBiography\nBruma was imprisoned during World War II, because of his nationalistic activities. After the war, he studied law at the Free University Amsterdam and, in 1951, he was involved in the founding of the Surinamese cultural association Wie Eegie Sanie (\"our own things\"). Bruma considered his own native language so important, that he addressed the World Youth Congress in Bucharest in Sranan Tongo. After returning to Suriname in 1954, he settled as a lawyer in Paramaribo.\n\nIn addition, he was also politically active. In 1959, he founded the \"Nationalist Movement Suriname\", which merged with the Nationalist Republican Party (PNR) in 1961. The PNR strived for immediate independence, while the National Party of Suriname led by Johan Pengel only wanted it in the long term. In that year, the PNR did not obtain a seat at the States elections. In the elections of 24 October 1969, his party did have a seat, after which Bruma, as a member of the parliament, opposed the government led by Prime Minister Jules Sedney. He was also chairman of the Progressive Labour Federation 47 (C-47; a counterpart to the General Alliance of Labour Unions, which was linked to the NPS), until he was succeeded by Freddy Derby.\n\nIn 1973, the PNR was one of the parties that was part of the National Party Combination (NPK), which won 22 out of 39 seats. After these elections, Bruma was the Minister of Economic Affairs in the Arron cabinet for four years, while his party colleague Eddy Hoost became Minister of Justice. During that reign, the ideal of Bruma was realized; Suriname became independent from the Netherlands in 1975. In the parliamentary elections of 1977, the PNR did not manage to secure a seat.\n\nAfter the military coup in 1980 led by Dési Bouterse, Bruma became the formateur of the Chin A Sen government, in which, in addition to civilians, members of the National Military Council (NMR) were involved. Chin A Sen, a physician, was a member of the PNR, but was not politically active before. Afterwards, he was mainly active as a lawyer, and sometimes he gave political advice. In October 2000, he was robbed at his home, resulting in a skull fracture. A few weeks later, he died of those injuries in a hospital at the age of 75. President Ronald Venetiaan gave a speech at his state funeral.\n\nAuthor\nThe first publication of Wie Eegie Sanie was not in Sranan Tongo, but written in Frisian, and published by the Frisian magazine De Tsjerne in 1952. The main reason was the recent acceptance of the Frisian language after Kneppelfreed. Bruma hoped that the Frisians would support his efforts of normalisation of Sranan Tongo. A large crowd gathered to hear the introduction by Fedde Schurer, but Bruma expected more sympathy for his cause.\n\nThat same year, Bruma also wrote De geboorte van Boni about the history of Maroon leader Boni in Dutch, and published poetry in Sranan Tongo for Koenders' Foetoe-boi. In 1954, Bruma became editor covering for Suriname for the De Tsjerne. In 1957, Bruma translated his novel about Boni in Sranan Tongo.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Eddy Bruma at Digital Library for Dutch Literature (in Dutch and Frisian)\n Eddy Bruma at Werkgroep Caraïbische Letteren (in Dutch)\n\n1925 births\n2000 deaths\nGovernment ministers of Suriname\nPeople from Paramaribo\nSurinamese lawyers\nSurinamese male writers\nSurinamese poets\nWest Frisian-language writers\nWriters in Sranan Tongo\nNationalist Republican Party (Suriname) politicians\n20th-century lawyers", "machine_text": " Eddy Bruma (born 16 January 1998) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward for Eerste Divisie side Roda JC Kerkrade.

Clark is also the Brazilian athlete who achieved the best result in the Brazilian delegation, making it to the quarterfinals in women's snowboard cross, finishing ninth overall.\n\nThe substitute on the Bobsleigh team, Claudinei Quirino, was a silver medalist in the Summer Olympic Games, where he finished second in Sydney with the Brazilian 4 × 100 m relay team. By participating in the Winter Games, Quirino became the second Brazilian man to have participated in both the Summer and Winter Games (the first was Matheus Inocêncio, who participated in Salt Lake 2002 and Athens 2004). On the women's side, Jaqueline Mourão became the first woman to have achieved this feat: she had participated in the mountain bike competition of Athens 2004 and in Turin 2006, she took part in the 10 km classical.\n\nOn 22 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced, in Rio de Janeiro, that alpine skier Nikolai Hentsch was to be the flag bearer for Brazil at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Games. For the closing ceremony, all the nine athletes participating in the Games remained in Turin. The Brazilians were seated by the organization in a privileged spot: in the first row immediately behind the podium where IOC president Jacques Rogge and the president of the Turin 2006 Organizing Committee, Valentino Castellani, delivered their speeches.\n\nAlpine skiing \n\nNikolai Hentsch competed in four of the five alpine skiing events, and had the Brazilian alpine team's best finish, placing 30th in the giant slalom.\n\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\n\nBobsleigh \n\nOn 13 February, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced that Armando dos Santos' preventive antidoping test, which had been done in Brazil on 4 January, was positive for the forbidden substance nandrolone. Santos was ejected from the team, being replaced by former sprinter Claudinei Quirino, the team's substitute athlete.\n\nOn 18 February, the Australian Olympic Committee filed a request with the International Olympic Committee, claiming that the qualification of the Brazilian team to the Olympics was invalid, and thus the Brazilian team should not be allowed to compete. The claim of the Australian Committee revolved around the circumstances of the qualification: the Brazilians earned their spot in the Games by winning the 2006 Challenge Cup, in late January, which awarded two spots in the Olympics.\n\nThat event took place two weeks after Armando dos Santos' anti-doping test, which turned out to be positive, had been performed, although the result was only divulged on 13 February. In that event, New Zealand came in second, which earned them a spot in the Olympics as well, and the Australian team was third. Thus, the Australians claimed that the Brazilian result should have been canceled, given the previous – although then unknown — positive doping result of an athlete of the Brazilian team. This would have removed the Brazilian team from the Olympics and awarded Australia the spot, as the second valid result from the qualification event (New Zealand would have moved to first place). On 19 February, the IOC ruled in favor of the Brazilians, rejecting the motion from the Australian Olympic Committee.\n\nRun 1 – In their first run, the Brazilians' sleigh turned over coming out of Curve 14, after an error by pilot Ricardo Raschini, causing the team to finish with an exceedingly slow time. After an initial scare, the Brazilians got out of the sleigh and decided to continue in competition. No one was hurt and their sleigh was not damaged, but they had to borrow a helmet from the German team, since one of the Brazilians' was badly damaged during the accident.\n\nRun 3 – In what looked like a replay of Heat 1, the Brazilians once again turned over in Curve 14. Once again, pilot Ricardo Raschini miscalculated his exit of this curve, causing the sleigh to turn over. This time, the accident was slightly more violent than the original one: the sleigh was completely upside down for a few seconds, and pusher Claudinei Quirino got out of the sleigh complaining of pain in one of his arms, being taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for detailed exams. He was released soon after, having been only medicated for the pain.\n\nThe event finished any faint possibility that the Brazilians could qualify for Heat 4, of which only the top 20 sleighs would participate. In an interview soon afterwards, Raschini took full responsibility for both the accidents, asking for \"the forgiveness of his team and the Brazilian people\", although reporting that insufficient training at the Olympic track was the main cause of his inability to master Curve 14. His teammates and Brazilian officials, however, were quick to show Raschini their full support, saying that no one is to blame for a competition mishappening and that they are already looking forward to Vancouver 2010. Edson Bindilatti, the brakeman, closed his statement vowing that \"the Frozen Bananas\" shall return \"in style\".\n\nOn another aspect of the last participation of the Brazilian team, they were able to secure a replacement helmet for second man Márcio Silva (he had had to borrow a German helmet the day before, for lack of a spare unit), having had it flown in from the United States, where the manufacturer is located.\n\nCross-country skiing \n\nDistance\n\nSnowboarding \n\nIsabel Clark Ribeiro qualified for the knockout rounds in the women's snowboard cross with the 5th fastest time, but a third-place finish in her quarterfinal left her battling for 9th place. In that classification race, she was forced to race from behind after a poor start, but benefited from an accident involving all the other three participants in her race, to end up in 9th overall.\n\nSnowboard Cross\n\nSee also\n Brazilian Olympic Committee\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Website of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (in Portuguese)\n Brazil NOC article listing team (last paragraph)*\n\nNations at the 2006 Winter Olympics\n2006 Winter Olympics\nWinter Olympics", "machine_text": " Brazil at the 2006 Winter Olympics Brazil sent a delegation to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy from 10–26 February 2006.

Only sporadically making first team appearances for his contracted club, Ginnelly has spent a number of years on loan at different clubs, including Altrincham, Lincoln City, Tranmere Rovers, and Bristol Rovers.\n\nClub career\n\nShrewsbury Town\nBorn in Nuneaton, England, Ginnelly began his career at Aston Villa, where he spent seven years. Following his release from the Aston Villa youth system, Ginnelly began a two-year scholarship with Shrewsbury Town in 2013.\n\nAt the start of his Shrewsbury Town career, Ginnelly was immediately assigned to the club's youth team. He quickly impressed for the youth side, and subsequently was called up to the first team by manager Michael Jackson. Ginnelly appeared as an unused substitute in the last game of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Gillingham.\n\nGinnelly made his Football League debut under manager Micky Mellon on 30 August 2014, coming on as a late substitute for James Collins in a 2–0 win over Luton Town at the New Meadow. After the match, he said making his professional debut was a \"dream come true\". Local newspaper, Shropshire Star, praised Ginnelly's performance for his technical ability, quoting: \"bringing down a long ball with his first touch before showing ambition by taking on two Luton defenders.\" However, Ginnelly only appeared two more times later in the 2014–15 season. He was awarded the club's Youth Player of the Year at the award ceremony.\n\nHe was offered his first professional contract in March 2015, but he failed to return to training the following pre-season with his contract situation unresolved.\n\nBurnley\nGinnelly was reported to be having trials with Norwich City, and Burnley, and joined the latter for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal on 10 August 2015.\n\nGinnelly was released by Burnley following the expiration of his contract after three years at the club, without making a first team appearance for the side.\n\nAltrincham (loan)\nOn 8 January 2016, Ginnelly joined National League side Altrincham on an initial one-month loan.

During a match against Barrow on 12 March 2016, Ginnelly was the subject of racist abuse by opposition fans, prompting a police investigation. Despite this, he had his loan spell at the club extended until the end of the season, having previously extended the previous month. Ginnelly scored two more goals later in the season as he went on to make twenty appearances and scored five times in all competitions – Altrincham were however still relegated from the division.\n\nWalsall (loan) \nOn 28 July 2016, Ginnelly signed for Football League One side Walsall on loan until January 2017. He made his Walsall debut on 30 August 2016, a 72nd-minute substitute, in a 5–2 win over Grimsby Town in the Football League Trophy. He spent much of the start of the season on the bench, finally making his league debut on 15 October 2016 in a 3–2 victory over his former club Shrewsbury. His performance earned him a run of games for the club, however he returned to Burnley in January 2017 having failed to make an appearance since November.\n\nLincoln City (loan) \nOn 30 January 2017, Ginnelly signed for National League leaders Lincoln City on loan until the end of the season. He made his Lincoln City debut, playing the whole game (and played a role that led to Terell Thomas scoring an own goal), in a 3–2 win over Woking on 11 February 2017. He made a total of seventeen appearances in all competitions as Lincoln finished as champions.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, Ginnelly re-joined Lincoln City on a season long loan for the 2017–18 season.

It wasn't until 7 November 2017 when he scored again in a 2–1 win over Notts County in the Football League Trophy. A month later, on 26 December 2017, Ginnelly scored his third goal of the season, in a 3–0 win over Stevenage. However, he appeared in and out of the starting eleven, and faced competition from other players, including loanee signing Danny Rowe. As a result, he was recalled by Burnley, making nineteen total appearances and scoring three times in his second loan spell at Lincoln City.\n\nTranmere Rovers (loan) \nOn 12 January 2018, he signed a loan deal with Tranmere Rovers until the end of the season. Ginnelly scored on his Tranmere Rovers debut eight days after joining the club, in a 3–2 win over Maidenhead United. Despite losing his first team place between late–March and mid–April, he returned to the starting lineup on 21 April 2018, in a 2–0 win over Halifax Town. In the play-off semi-final, Ginnelly scored in a 4–2 win over Ebbsfleet. Ginnelly played the entirety of the National League play-off final, helping the side beat Boreham Wood 2–1 at Wembley and ensuring the club's return to the EFL after a three-year absence. He went on to make 12 appearances and scoring two times for the side.\n\nWalsall\nAfter being released by Burnley at the end of the 2017–18 season, it was announced on 5 June 2018 that Ginnelly signed a one–year contract at former loan club Walsall. Upon joining the club, he revealed that Manager Dean Keates convinced him to re-join Walsall, citing his style of management.\n\nGinnelly's first game after re-signing for the club came in the opening game of the season, where he started the match and played 84 minutes, in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle. It wasn't until 14 August 2018 when he scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–1 win over Tranmere Rovers in the first round of the League Cup.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Carl von Garaguly\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Carl von Garaguly (28 December 1900 – 18 October 1984), also known as Carl Garaguly, was a Hungarian violinist and conductor who spent much of his working life in Scandinavia. He was born in Budapest, and worked many years in Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden, both as violinist and as a conductor.\n\nLife and career \nGaraguly was a child prodigy, performing in public from the age of 6, having received his first violin lessons from his father. By the age of 10 he was undertaking concert tours.\n\nHe studied violin with Jenő Hubay at the Hungarian State Academy in 1907-08, and with Henri Marteau at the Berlin High School for Music from 1914–16, and was a member of the Marteau Society. \nAged 17 he became the assistant deputy leader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. During war service he made concert tours for the Red Cross before teaching for a time at the Conservatory of Arad, Transylvannia.\n\nGaraguly moved to Sweden in 1923 and from that year until 1930 he was the leader of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and also first violin of the Gothenburg Quartet.\nGaraguly began his association with the Stockholm Concert Society (today the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1930 as deputy leader, in which post he also performed solos in concert works by Mozart, Wieniawski, Pergament, Berwald, Mendelssohn and Hubay.\nHe continued as deputy leader up until being appointed principal conductor of the orchestra from 1942 until 1953. \nHaving studied conducting with Clemens Krauss he had made his debut as conductor in March 1940, having previously conducted two schools concerts. During his tenure he led nearly 300 concerts, as well 100 school or youth concerts. He conducted two concerts in London in 1952 during the orchestra's visit. Garaguly's appointment was not universally welcomed, with some criticizing the orchestra board for not giving the job to Tor Mann. In addition, Kurt Atterberg attacked Garaguly’s nomination because he was not born in Sweden (although he had lived there for half his life and was married to a Swedish woman).\nHis primary repertoire interest was modern music, but he also conducted the major classics. His rehearsal and preparation was much admired and the orchestra became more reliable technically during his tenure. His final appearance conducting the orchestra was on 26 October 1982.\n \nGaraguly was named music director of Harmonien (the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1952. He was conductor of the Arnhem Symphony Orchestra (officially called Het Gelders Orkest (HGO) in Dutch) from 1959-1972, and the Sønderjyllands Symfoniorkester in Denmark from 1965 to 1979, while also returning to Stockholm to guest conduct.\n\nHe gave the premiere of the symphony of Anne-Marie Ørbeck in 1954 in Bergen.\n\nDiscography \nBerlin Classics have issued recordings of Garaguly conducting the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra in Sibelius Symphonies 1 and 7, the Háry János Suite by Kodály, pieces by Johann Strauss and a suite from Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk district, Op. 29 by Shostakovich.\nIn their series of violin concertos with Kai Laursen, Danacord has several where the conductor is Garaguly leading the South Jutland Symphony Orchestra: Concerto for Violin in A major, Op. 6 by Svendsen, Concerto for Violin in G major by Ludvig Holm, Concerto for Violin in D major, Op. 20 by Peder Gram, Concerto for Violin in G major, Op. 11 by Hakon Børresen, Concerto for Violin in D major by Enna, Concerto for Violin in B minor, Op. 27 by Gustav Helsted, Concerto for Violin, Op. 48 by Emborg and the Chamber Concerto no 9 for Violin and Viola, Op. 39 by Holmboe.\nCarl Nielsen's Symphony No 2 and Suite for String Orchestra were recorded by Garaguly with the Tivoli Orchestra (Vox).

He was a teacher at the Berliner Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst (The Berlin College of Graphics and Book Art) from its foundation in 1927 until his death in 1938. Garaguly was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1880. He studied art at the Hungarian National School of Arts in Budapest. In 1901 he was awarded a state scholarship to study in Germany, and he attended the Kunstakademie in Munich, where he studied under Paul Klendl and Ludwig von Herterich. In 1906 he moved to Berlin and studied under Heymann Steib at the Königliche Kunstakademie (The Royal College of Art) in Berlin. In 1908 Garaguly was one of the founding members of the Berliner Secession. He was also a member of the Deutscher Werkbund and the Novembergruppe. He exhibited widely, including at the Venice Biennale (1914 and 1916), the Berlin Secession, the Great Berlin Art Exhibition, the Munich Glaspalast, and the Deutsche Werkbundausstellung in Cologne. Garaguly's work was strongly influenced by the art of the Old Masters, particularly that of the Italian Renaissance. He sought to combine traditional techniques and motifs with modern ideas and materials. This can be seen in his prints, where he often used modern techniques such as photomechanics to create images that were both modern and traditional in their appearance. In his paintings, Garaguly often used traditional materials such as tempera and gold leaf, but he also incorporated modern elements, such as the use of industrial materials and the depiction of urban scenes. Garaguly was a teacher at the Berliner Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst (The Berlin College of Graphics and Book Art) from its foundation in 1927 until his death in 1938. He was a member of the faculty of the college's Department of Book Arts, and he taught courses in graphic design, illustration, and painting.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4738024}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Syria–Turkey relations\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Turkey shares its longest common border with Syria; various geographic and historical links also tie the two neighbouring countries together.\n\nThe traditionally tense relations between Turkey and Syria had been due to disputes including the self annexation of the Hatay Province to Turkey in 1939, water disputes resulting from the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syria's support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (abbreviated as PKK) and the now-dissolved Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (abbreviated as ASALA) which has been recognised as a terrorist organisation by NATO, the EU, and many other countries. Relations improved greatly after October 1998, when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled by the Syrian authorities. However, the Syrian civil war has once again strained relations between the two countries, leading to the suspension of diplomatic contact. A serious incident occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012, resulting in Turkey calling an emergency meeting of NATO.\n\nSyria had maintained an embassy in Ankara and two consulates–general in Istanbul and Gaziantep. Turkey had an embassy in Damascus and a consulate–general in Aleppo. Diplomatic relations between the countries were severed in March 2012, due to the Syrian civil war. Turkey is a full member of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) while Syria's membership was suspended due to the civil war.\n\nHistory\n\nTurkish rule pre-WWI\nTurkish dynasties managed to rule Syria and the region starting from the Tulunids in the late 9th century, followed by Ikhshidids, Seljuq Empire, Burid dynasty, Artuqids, and Zengids until late 12th century. In 1516, Syria was annexed by the Ottoman Empire until the WWI in the early 20th century.\n\nHatay annexation\n\nIn 1938, the Sanjak of Alexandretta became independent from the French mandate of Syria as the Republic of Hatay, and following a referendum, 8 months later in 1939, it decided to join Turkey as the Hatay Province. This self-annexation was never recognized by Syria, which continues to show the Hatay Province of Turkey as part of Syria's territory on maps.\n\nAt present, Syrians hold the view that this land is historically Syrian and was illegally ceded in the late 1930s to Turkey by France – the mandatory occupying power of Syria (between 1920 and 1946). The Turks remember Syria as a former Ottoman vilayet. In 1938, the Turkish Army went into the former Syrian Mediterranean province with French approval and expelled most of its Alawite Arab and Armenian inhabitants. Before this, Alawi Arabs and Armenians were the majority of the provincial population. For the referendum, Turkey crossed tens of thousands of Turks into Alexandretta to vote.\n\nIn 1938, the province declared its independence from France and the following 29 June, the parliament of the newly declared Hatay Republic voted to join Turkey. This referendum has been labeled both \"phoney\" and \"rigged\", and that it was a way for the French to let Turks take over the area, hoping that they would turn on Hitler.  Syrians still consider this land as integral Syrian territory. Syrians call this land Liwaaa aliskenderuna rather than the Turkish name of Hatay.\n\nWater politics\nWater disputes have been a major source of conflict as Turkey has constructed several dams on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers as part of the Southeastern Anatolia Project- GAP to develop the region. The project GAP was aimed at reducing the harsh living conditions of the Southeastern provinces of Turkey by building 19 dams on the rivers of Euphrates and Tigris. This project, however, would seriously reduce Syrian water resources.\n\nIn addition to this, Euphrates and Tigris are not the only rivers that tangles Turkish-Syrian relations, the water distribution of Orantes River which pours into Mediterranean from the province of disputed Hatay also rises problems between two states.\n\nSupport to the PKK\nTurkey has condemned Syria for supporting the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization internationally by a number of states and organizations, including the US, NATO, and the EU and has claimed that Syria employed Alois Brunner to train Kurdish militants for attacks against Turkey.\n\nThe two countries came to the brink of war when Turkey threatened military action if Syria continued to shelter Abdullah Öcalan in Damascus, his long-time safe haven. Relations have improved since October 1998, when Öcalan was expelled by Damascus and Syria pledged to stop harbouring the PKK militants and the 1999 signing of the Adana agreement, following his subsequent capture in Kenya, envisaged security cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHelicopter downing\n\nIn October 1989, 2 Syrian Mig-21's flew  into Turkish airspace where they shot down a Turkish aircraft. All five of the crew on the Turkish aircraft died.\n\nDiplomatic thaw 2003–2011\nIn The New Turkey (Granta Books, 2005), BBC correspondent Chris Morris claims that Syria was \"for years a bitter foe\" as \"Turkey's secular democracy, its application for EU membership and its close relationship with the United States have long been regarded in Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus with intense suspicion. Islamists look at the secular state which buried the caliphate and think 'betrayal'; and Arab nationalists still haven't forgotten that Turks are their former colonial rulers.\" \"But there's been a thaw, especially since the AKP came to power,\" and \"the new Turkish model – trying to mix greater democracy and Islam together – is now the subject of curiosity and not a little envy.\"\n\nThe Turkish Parliament's refusal to cooperate militarily with the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point in Syrian-Turkish bilateral relations as Syria's perceptions of Turkey as incapable of acting independently were altered.\n\nThe first ever visit to Turkey by a Syrian President was made by Bashar al-Assad to Ankara in January 2004. In late 2004, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan flew to Damascus to sign a free trade agreement, in the follow-up to former Turkish President Turgut Özal's high-level trade negotiations with Syrian authorities in the 1990s and Erdoğan's own recently successful bid to initiate a Turkish EU accession which would allow Europe, \"to extend its reach to the borders Syria, Iraq and Iran.\" On 3 April 2007, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Syrian President Bashar Al Assad attended the opening ceremony of the Aleppo International Stadium.\n\nIn 2005, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer went to visit Damascus, despite U.S. objections, during the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon.\n\nIn 2008, Turkey was, as a sign of mutual trust in Damascus and Jerusalem, invited to play the role of facilitator between Syria and Israel to solve their dispute over control over the Golan Heights, but these talks were abandoned after four rounds, which included a visit by Syrian President Bashir al-Assad to Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan at Bodrum in August, following the deterioration in Turkey-Israel relations over the 2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict,\n\nMilitary cooperation\nOn 26 April 2009, the two states announced an \"unprecedented\" three-day military manoeuvre involving ground forces along their mutual border in what was described as \"a step further in their ever-expanding cooperation.\" According to Turkish military sources, \"The aim of the exercise is to boost friendship, cooperation, and confidence between the two countries land forces, and to increase the ability of border troops to train and work together.\"  The exercise which commenced on 27 April involved teams from each country crossing the border to visit outposts.\n\nVisiting Syrian Defense Minister Hasan Turkmani and Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gönül also signed a letter of intent giving the green light for cooperation in the defence industry, on the sidelines of the 9th International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF'09) that commenced in Istanbul the same day, as a sign of the level of political relations reached between the two states, although a Turkish defence industry source emphasised that, \"it does not mean that the two countries will immediately enter into cooperation in arms production.\"\n\n2009 Turkish Presidential visit to Syria\nTurkish President Gül's 15–17 May official visit to Syria was made at the invitation of Damascus in reciprocation of Syrian President Assad's 2007 official visit to Turkey. A senior Turkish diplomat confirmed that, \"The main topic on the agenda and the goal of the visit is the maintenance of momentum that has built up in bilateral relations within the last decade.\" The Turkish delegation included Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Çağlayan, Agriculture Minister and Culture and Tourism Minister Ertuğrul Günay.\n\nShortly before the visit new Syrian Ambassador to Turkey, Nidal Qablan confirmed that Syria was ready to restart the Turkish mediated peace negotiations with Israel and Gül supported the call, following his meeting with Assad, stating that, \"We have heard Syria say it is ready to resume the peace talks from the point where they stopped with the previous [Israeli] government. We in Turkey are also ready.\" Assad confirmed, \"Turkey's role is important because we have trust in Turkey.\" Israeli President Shimon Peres dismissed these calls stating, \"The Syrians should be ready to talk. If President al-Assad wants peace, why is he shy? We suggested direct talks many times. He thinks direct talks are a prize for Israel. It's not a prize. It's normal.\"\n\nFriction due to Syrian Civil War\n\nSince the start of Syrian Civil War, relations between Syria and Turkey greatly deteriorated. The Syrian conflict began to impact Turkey when at least 3,000 Syrian refugees fled Syria as a consequence of such incidents as Syrian army operation in Jisr ash-Shugur in June 2011. In June 2011, Turkish prime minister Erdogan described to Anadolu Agency, his feeling that \"They [Syria] are not acting in a humane manner. This is savagery.\" However, at the beginning, the Turkish government refrained from describing the Syrians who fled to Turkey as \"refugees\" or \"asylum-seekers\", instead referring to them as guests, and Erdogan, while demanding the implementation of promised reforms by the Syrian government, initially refrained from calling for Bashar al-Assad's departure, although he later would.\n\nTimeline \n\nOn 9 August 2011, the BBC and other news sites reported that Turkey sent its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, to Syria to give the government a \"tough\" message. Erdogan has said that he is becoming impatient with the \"savagery\" of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ahmet Davutoğlu also announced that \"We are completely suspending all of these trade relations, all agreements between Turkey and Syria have been suspended.\"\n\nThe Turkish pilgrim bus attack occurred on 21 November 2011 when two buses carrying Turkish pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia came under fire from Syrian soldiers. The attack occurred at a checkpoint near Homs, as a convoy of eight or nine Turkish buses was making its way towards Turkey via the Bab Hawa border crossing. The gunfire left two people injured. According to a driver, when told that the passengers were Turks, \"Syrian soldiers emerged from behind sandbags and cursed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan... Then they suddenly opened fire at the bus.\"\n\nOn 9 April 2012, the Syrian envoy to Turkey was summoned after Syrian forces fired across the Syria–Turkey border. At least two were killed and many others injured in the incident.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, Syria shot down a Turkish Air Force RF-4E reconnaissance jet near the Turkish-Syrian border. The Syrian military alleges the jet had violated Syrian airspace. However, Turkish president Abdullah Gül and other spokesmen have not confirmed this and emphasized that brief incursions into neighboring airspace by high-speed jets are routine occurrences. Gül stated that \"it is not possible to cover over a thing like this. Whatever is necessary will no doubt be done.\" The Turkish and Syrian navies conducted a search for Turkish airmen downed by the incident.\n\nIn August 2012, Turkey began to hold high level meetings with the USA on plans to replace the Syrian government.\n\nOn 3 October 2012, Turkey attacked troops in Syria, after a Syrian mortar shell killed five people. Turkish parliament approved cross border operations. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan announced 5 October \"We are not interested in war, but we're not far from it either,\"\n\nOn 10 October 2012, Turkish Air Force F-16s intercepted a Syrian Air Airbus A320, flight RB442 from Moscow to Damascus, in Turkish airspace and forced it to land at Ankara Esenboğa Airport, suspecting it was carrying Russian-made weapons. Inspectors confiscated military communications equipment and items \"thought to be missile parts\". Syria accused Turkey of \"air piracy\". On the same day the airline chief said in an interview that Turkey violated the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation Syria subsequently banned Turkish civilian flights from its airspace.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, an anti-aircraft shell from Syria hit a health center in Turkey's Hatay Province.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, two car bombs exploded in the town of Reyhanlı, Hatay Province, Turkey. At least 43 people were killed and 140 more were injured in the attack. The car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 local time (10:45 GMT) and the second exploded about 15 minutes later. People attempting to help those injured in the first explosion were caught in the second blast. This attack was the deadliest single act of terrorism to occur on Turkish soil.\n\nOn 23 March 2014, Turkey shot down a Syrian combat jet in Hatay Province near Turkish-Syrian border. The initial announcement was made by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech during the 2014 Turkish local elections campaign. Turkey claimed that two Turkish Air Force F-16s downed the plane that breached Turkish airspace and ignored warnings, as a result of the infringement of the new engagement rules declared by the Republic of Turkey, after Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance plane on 22 June 2012. The pilot jumped off the plane according to witness reports. Syria condemned the aggression and argued that the plane was following rebels and it did not violate Turkish airspace. However, according to the new engagement rules, two countries could defend themselves if the other come close to their borders, perceiving the action as a threat.\n\nOn 18 June, based on information provided by a Euro-Med Monitor team, Turkish border guards have killed eleven Syrians, including four children and two women, while they were trying to cross the Turkish-Syrian border by opening the fire directly on them once they reached Syria's Idlib province. The Turkish government claimed that the authorities meant to kill the smugglers and terrorists not the civilians in search of protecting their borders. Some eyewitness testimonies from refugee families confirmed to the Euro-Med Monitor team that all the ones who were killed by the Turkish guards were civilians. \nMost of the deaths, reached to the borders, ran away from ISIS control before they got and hid in the northern Aleppo countryside for 15 days. Testimonies collected by Euro-Med Monitor team said that a smuggler help the victims get to the Syria's Idlib province. The victims were deceived by the smuggler when he told them that the Turkish borders are safe and gave them the legal permission to cross the borders. Turkish border guards have killed 60 Syrians before as they were trying to cross the border.\n\nOn 24 August 2016, Turkey and Turkish backed rebels attacked ISIS positions across the border, from Jarabulus west to Al-Rai, taking a series of towns and taking a hold of a strip 5 to 20 km deep. Turkey called this operation Euphrates Shield.\n\nIn recordings released in 2014, Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan suggests that rockets should be fired from Syria into Turkey to justify military action in retaliation.\n\nIn 2020, following the Balyun airstrikes, Turkey initiated Operation Spring Shield against the Syrian army.\n\nSee also \n\n Foreign relations of Syria\n Foreign relations of Turkey\n Levant Quartet\n Turks in Syria\n Syrians in Turkey\n Turkish occupation of northern Syria\n Operation Olive Branch\n Syria–Turkey barrier\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Alam, Kamal.  \"The Assad-Erdogan Relationship: A Mirror into Syrian-Turkish Ties.\" Asian Affairs (2020): 1-14.\n\nExternal links \n Embassy of Turkey in Damascus\n Embassy of Syria in Ankara\n Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs about relations with Syria\n Syria-Turkey Economical Relationship, Al-Jazeera, December 2009\n \n\n \nTurkey\nBilateral relations of Turkey\nRelations of colonizer and former colony", "machine_text": " Syria–Turkey relations Syria and Turkey have a very complex relationship, which has been marked by both cooperation and conflict.

The two countries also share a border, which has been the source of some tension in recent years. In the modern era, Syria and Turkey have been in a state of competition and rivalry. This has been most evident in the region of Cyprus, where the two countries have been in a state of conflict since the 1950s. In addition, the two countries have also been in a state of competition in the region of Syria itself, where Turkey has been trying to assert its influence. In recent years, the two countries have been in a state of cooperation as well.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ducati Desmosedici\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Ducati Desmosedici is a four-stroke V4 engine racing motorcycle made by Ducati for MotoGP racing. The series nomenclature is GP with the two-digit year appended, such as Desmosedici GP10 for 2010. In 2006 Ducati made a short production run of 1,500 street-legal variants, the Desmosedici RR.\n\nBackground \nDucati abandoned the Grand Prix racing scene at the start of the 1970s. For many years the 500 class was essentially a class for two-stroke motorcycles, an engineering technology that was far removed from the four-stroke road-going machines sold by Ducati. Technical rules changed in 2002, giving priority to four-stroke machinery and turning the 500 class of World Road Racing into the MotoGP Championship. This convinced Ducati to make a much-awaited return to the track in the new MotoGP class.\n\nDucati history is classically based on 90° V-twin (or L-twin) engines, using desmodromic valve technology. Initially, Ducati considered the possibility of creating a MotoGP 'super-twin', taking advantage of the MotoGP regulations that give twin-cylinder machines a considerable weight reduction over four, five or six-cylinder bikes. However, analysis indicated that a twin-cylinder engine would not have been able to produce the required amount of power, without excessively increasing the number of revs. A twin would have had to rev at over 17,000 rpm, but this would require a very short stroke and a very large bore, as a result producing possible combustion problems.\n\nThe basis of the design of the Desmosedici engine therefore is two classical Ducati L-twins next to each other, making a Double L-twin with two-cylinder Stroking at the same time (also called Twin Pulse). With four valves per cylinder, the total number of valves is sixteen – Desmosedici means desmodromic distribution with sixteen valves shortened in Italian.\n\nDesign had started in 2001, the bike was unveiled at the 2002 Italian GP at Mugello, for use in the following seasons MotoGP World Championship. Vittoriano Guareschi, the Ducati Corse test-rider, followed every phase of the Desmosedici's development process from early testing to track debut and the project's evolution. In 2007, Ducati's pilot Casey Stoner, riding a Desmosedici, obtained Ducati's first MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nIn early 2021, Ducati rider Johann Zarco set the highest trap speed record in competition practice on the Desmosedici.\n\nGP3 \nWhile still fully committed to Superbike racing, the Ducati Marlboro Team of Loris Capirossi and Troy Bayliss would compete in all rounds of the 2003 MotoGP championship. The Desmosedici GP3 quickly scored a series of results with Loris Capirossi, who stepped onto the podium in the opening round of the championship in Japan and won the GP Catalunya in Barcelona. Riders Capirossi finished fourth in the final championship standings and Bayliss sixth; while Ducati finished second overall in the Manufacturers' standings.\n\nGP4 \nIn 2004 the Desmosedici GP4, again in the hands of Capirossi and Bayliss, underwent a series of major modifications. A large part of the season went by before the bike became competitive, but the season concluded with both riders on the podium.\n\nGP5 \n\nThe GP5 version lined up for Ducati's third season in MotoGP, with Bayliss replaced by the Spanish rider Carlos Checa. Thanks to a collaboration agreement with Bridgestone, Ducati could finally contribute to the development of new tyres and by the end of the season the Desmosedici became a competitive machine. Bridgestone found that hard tyres suited the bike more than softer tyres to create grip, allowing it to spin the rear wheel gave better control. Capirossi took two wins in the Grand Prix of Japan at Motegi and in the Malaysian GP at Sepang, while Checa scored a brace of podium finishes.\n\nGP6 \nLaunched at the Italian skiing resort of Madonna di Campiglio, the GP6 is a lighter and more powerful version of the GP5. Involving better aerodynamics and a better fuel tank position, most importantly, although more powerful, the engine delivery was smoothened to make the bike more rideable. This made the bike slower on top speed, but quicker into, around and out of corners.\n\nThe new rider with Capirossi was Spanish rider Sete Gibernau. After encouraging winter tests, the Desmosedici GP6 took its first win of 2006 in the opening GP at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, followed by a podium in Qatar. Capirossi led the championship for a short while, but at the start of the Grand prix de Catalunya at Barcelona, Gibernau's bike collided with Capirossi's after Gibernau braked too late and compressed his brake lever further after impacting it on the back of Capirossi's bike. Both riders ended up injured and in the hospital, with Gibernau sustaining a broken collar bone, and both missed the Dutch Grand Prix at Assen. Capirossi returned at the British Grand Prix, while Gibernau was replaced by German Alex Hofmann for the Dutch Grand Prix, the British Grand Prix, and also the Czech Grand Prix after undergoing additional surgery. With Gibernau  sidelined for the final round of the season at Valencia following a collision with Casey Stoner, Ducati recalled Bayliss, who was recently crowned World Superbike champion. The race was won by Bayliss, his first MotoGP victory, with Capirossi taking second place for the first Ducati 1–2 finish.\n\nGP7 \nFor 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to cap motors to a maximum displacement of 800 cc. In response, Ducati built the GP7. Its specifications were: 800 cc bike, double L-Twin motor (4 Cylinder Twin Pulse).\n\nDucati started its project to build an 800 cc MotoGP bike extremely early and according to Ducati's racing chief Filippo Preziosi, by August 2006 Ducati had already built twenty 800 cc engines with various specifications. In addition, an early version of the bike was track tested for the first time during early May 2006. Public testing with the bike began at the Brno Track, where Loris Capirossi had won the day before riding the GP6, on the 21st of August. Capirossi's lap times on the prototype GP7 were only 1.4 seconds off his track record time set on the 990 cc GP6.\n\nFurther testing of the GP7 in Motegi, Japan, revealed that the 800 cc machine could run faster laps than the higher-displacement 990 cc bikes, and held nearly a second advantage over the next fastest 800 cc bike, a Honda ridden by Dani Pedrosa.\n\nMotoGP's 800 cc era officially began with the first race of the 2007 MotoGP season, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Casey Stoner won the race on the new GP7. The bike had a clear top speed advantage over the rest of the grid, due to its higher output motor. A new track record was set on the GP7. Second place contender and five time World champion, Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, realised that \"unfortunately, there was too much difference between (our) bikes in the straight\" and \"Our Yamaha will never go as quick on a straight as the Ducati.\" These words turned out to be true, as the GP7 enjoyed a top speed advantage throughout the season, although the other manufacturers (Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki) closed the gap significantly by the end of the year. Stoner and his Bridgestone-shod Ducati proved to be the top combination in MotoGP and he won the world championship at Motegi, Japan, on September 23, 2007, four races before the end of the season.\n\nGP8 \n\nAn update of the GP7 design, Ducati's entry for the 2008 MotoGP World Championship was tested first in February 2007.\n\nFor purposes of avoiding chatter which was encountered on some occasions with GP7, the rigidity of the GP8's frame was altered, although further details of relevant modifications are not disclosed. In addition, in an attempt to reduce an effect described as \"pumping\", some modifications to the bike's suspension geometry were made.\n\nAs with its predecessor the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800 cc engine with desmodromic actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power compared to that of the GP7.\n\nThroughout 2007, Ducati tested a special fuel-saving clutch arrangement which disengaged the clutch during braking and reduced fuel consumption, however the arrangement was not incorporated in the GP8 as various advanced lubricants and fuels used with the GP8 are believed to provide comparable fuel savings, while decreasing internal engine friction and increasing maximum power.\n\nIn race trim, the bike recorded an official top speed of  at the 2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nGP9 \nThe GP9 was Ducati's entry for the 2009 MotoGP World Championship. Ducati began testing it on track prior to May 2008.  On 9 June 2008, Ducati publicly rolled out the Desmosedici GP9 for testing at Circuit de Catalunya.\n\nA distinctive feature of GP9 is its carbon fibre chassis, representing a departure from Ducati's traditional steel trellis chassis. Although carbon fibre chassis were tried in mid 1980s, currently no other MotoGP racing team uses them.\n\nGP10 \nOn January 15, 2010, Ducati introduced the GP10 for the 2010 MotoGP season. Development concentrated on improving engine longevity, to keep within new engine restrictions, and rideability. Most notably, the GP10 makes use of a big-bang firing order for the first time since the Desmosedici changed from the 990 cc to the 800 cc engine capacity. Ducati also redesigned the fairing, first seen at the 2009 Estoril round.\n\nGP11 \nOn January 12, 2011, Ducati introduced the GP11 for the 2011 MotoGP season. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP12 \nOn March 19, 2012, Ducati unveiled the GP12 for the 2012 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season which incorporated new displacement standards of up to 1,000 cc in capacity. The bike was raced by Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden.\n\nGP16 \nThe Desmosedici GP16 was unveiled in February 2016. It ran the first two pre-season tests with race riders Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone without a livery. Ducati's MotoGP boss Gigi Dall'Igna describes the 2016 Desmosedici as an \"evolution\" of its recent challengers. The GP16 was still the fastest bike in a straight line with its extra power. The winglets remained from the previous year, albeit now coloured to match the predominantly white and red Desmosedici.\n\nIn the 10th round of the season in Austria, Ducati dominated all sessions. Andrea Iannone and Andrea Dovizioso qualified 1st and 3rd respectively. In the race, Ducati used their lack of wheelies and extra power to stretch out a gap to Jorge Lorenzo after some laps. The two bikes stayed together, with Dovizioso in first for most of the race. But Iannone out-braked him and took the lead into the penultimate corner of the last lap. The win was the first for Iannone in MotoGP and his first since Moto2 Italy 2012. The win was the first for Ducati (and any other manufacturer than Honda or Yamaha) since Casey Stoner won for the team in 2010 Australian Grand Prix. Dovizioso finished in 2nd place to mark the first Ducati 1–2 finish since the 2007 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nIn the 17th round of the season at the newly resurfaced Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, Dovizioso took his second pole of the year in wet conditions. At the start, he fell back to 4th while Iannone, who had qualified in 6th place, led briefly before falling to 2nd place. He stayed there till he crashed at Turn 9. That left Valentino Rossi with Dovizioso at the front and Jorge Lorenzo in a distant 3rd place. Rossi ran wide at turn 1 some laps later and fell back by around 1+ seconds per lap. 'DesmoDovi' held on for his first win with Ducati and his first win since his victory at Donington Park with the Repsol Honda Team in 2009.\n\nDesmosedici RR \n\nThe Desmosedici RR is a road-legal version of the Desmosedici, first delivered in early 2008.\n\nComplete MotoGP results\n\nMotorcycle summary\nThese results are accurate up to the 2021 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nWorld Championship titles:\nRiders: 1 (Casey Stoner )\nTeams: 2 (Ducati Marlboro Team , Ducati Lenovo Team )\nConstructors: 3 (, , )\n\nRaces won: 58\n2003: Capirossi 1 (1 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 2 (2 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 3, Bayliss 1 (4 in total)\n2007: Stoner 10, Capirossi 1 (11 in total)\n2008: Stoner 6 (6 in total)\n2009: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2010: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2016: Iannone 1, Dovizioso 1 (2 in total)\n2017: Dovizioso 6 (6 in total)\n2018: Dovizioso 4, Lorenzo 3 (7 in total)\n2019: Dovizioso 2, Petrucci 1 (3 in total)\n2020: Dovizioso 1, Petrucci 1 (2 in total)\n2021: Miller 2, Martín 1, Bagnaia 4 (7 in total)\n\nPoles: 55\n2003: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2005: Capirossi 3 (3 in total)\n2006: Capirossi 2, Gibernau 1 (3 in total)\n2007: Stoner 5 (5 in total)\n2008: Stoner 9 (9 in total)\n2009: Stoner 3 (3 in total)\n2010: Stoner 4 (4 in total)\n2014: Dovizioso 1 (1 in total)\n2015: Dovizioso 1, Iannone 1 (2 in total)\n2016: Dovizioso 2, Iannone 1 (3 in total)\n2018: Lorenzo 4, Dovizioso 2, Miller 1 (7 in total)\n2020: Zarco 1 (1 in total)\n2021: Bagnaia 6, Martín 4, Zarco 1 (11 in total)\n\nDucati Desmosedici results\n(key) (results in bold indicate pole position; results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nNotes\n\n1 Being his final MotoGP race, Capirossi switched numbers for Valencia as a memorial to his fallen countryman Marco Simoncelli, killed at Sepang, by racing with No. 58 that Simoncelli used, instead of his normal No. 65.

Development of the Desmosedici began in 2004, in a project codenamed \"Project 11\". The project's goal was to produce a V4 engine that was lighter, more compact, and more powerful than the existing V-twin engine used in the Ducati 999. In 2007, the Desmosedici was introduced on the race track, and in 2008 it was introduced on the street, in the Ducati Desmosedici RR. The Desmosedici (pronounced \"de-mos-de-dee-chee\" in English, Italian for \"desmodromic valve\") engine has a 90° V-angle, with four cylinders, each with 4 valves, and with a total capacity of 1,198 cc. It is liquid-cooled, and has a very oversquare bore/stroke ratio (the bore is 80 mm (3.15 in) and the stroke is only 41.5 mm (1.6 in)), which gives the engine very high revving abilities. The engine is fed by a large airbox, and by a 55 mm (2.2 in) throttle body. The Desmosedici's construction is unique. It has a monocoque construction, with the engine block, cylinder head, and swingarm all cast in a single piece. The engine also uses a \"stacked\" design, with the front bank of cylinders angled backward, and the rear bank angled forward. This allows the engine to be more compact, and also allows the engine to be placed in a \"reverse\" configuration, with the rear cylinder bank pointing toward the front of the motorcycle. The Desmosedici was designed to be a \"race engine\", and was not designed with street use in mind. As a result, it was not equipped with many of the features that are standard on street motorcycles, such as a rev limiter, a throttle-by-wire system, traction control, or anti-lock braking. The Desmosedici also has a very high compression ratio, which further limits its usability on the street. Despite these limitations, the Desmosedici was homologated for street use in the United States, Europe, and Japan. However, due to its very high price, and its very limited production numbers, the Desmosedici was never a big seller. Only 1,200 Desmosedicis were produced, and the last one was produced in 2015.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2456422}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Richard Breitman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Richard David Breitman, born in 1947, is an American historian best known for his study of the Holocaust.\n\nRichard Breitman is an American historian who has written extensively on modern German history, the Holocaust, American immigration and refugee policy, and intelligence during and after World War II. He has spent his career in the history department at American University in Washington, D.C. from which he retired as distinguished professor emeritus in 2015. He has written or co-authored twelve books and served for twenty-five years as editor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, a scholarly journal owned by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nEducation and career \nBreitman was born in 1947, in Connecticut. His grandparents had emigrated to the U.S. from Odessa and Krakow in 1905 and settled in Hartford, CT. His parents were American-born, his father, Saul, a businessman, his mother, Gloria (nee Salz) a homemaker. Breitman attended public schools in West Hartford, and he credits an inspiring high school history teacher, Robert Derosier, with bringing European history to life for him.\n\nBreitman graduated from Yale summa cum laude and earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. in modern European history at Harvard. His first book, German Socialism and Weimar Democracy (University of North Carolina Press, 1981), explored the tensions between socialist goals and democratic convictions in the Social Democratic Party of Germany during the Weimar Republic.\n\nNot long after, Breitman read an article by the famous historian Walter Laqueur that traced[js1]  the story of an anonymous German industrialist who in 1942 brought to the West information about Hitler’s planned use of gas chambers and crematoria to destroy European Jewry. This man’s identity had remained a mystery for decades. Breitman, after months of archival research, proved that he was Eduard Schulte, a prominent but secret anti-Nazi CEO of a large mining firm who traveled frequently between Germany and Switzerland. Together, Breitman and Laqueur then wrote Schulte’s story that detailed the muted reactions to his warnings: Breaking the Silence: the German Who Exposed the Final Solution (Simon & Schuster, 1986; University Press of new England, 1991). Translated into several languages, it remains in print.\n\nIn 1994, Breitman requested that the National Security Agency declassify its holdings of World War II intercepts and decodes of enemy radio messages. The NSA Historical Cryptographic Collection, amounting to some 1.3 million pages, was turned over to the U.S. National Archives. In this mass, Breitman found a small file of British decodes of German police radio messages that revealed important information about the first stage of the Holocaust. Prodded by Parliament, the British government followed with its own, larger, declassification of German police decodes. Breitman mined both archives for his 1998 book Official Secrets: What the Nazis Planned, What the British and Americans Knew (Hill & Wang). Still in print in a number of languages, it examines the relationships among German, British, and American policies toward European Jews.\n\nBreitman then served as director of historical research for a small U.S. government body set up to oversee implementation of a 1998 declassification law called the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. This organization helped to declassify more than eight million pages of U.S. government records, and a team of four historians used them to write U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis (Cambridge University Press, 2005).\n\nBreitman’s best-known books are The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), which made the case for Heinrich Himmler’s central planning of the Holocaust; and a work co-authored with Allan J. Lichtman, FDR and the Jews (Belknap-Harvard, 2013). In the latter, Breitman and Lichtman argued that Franklin Roosevelt’s policies toward European Jewry fluctuated substantially over time according to circumstances and political calculations and constraints, but that his record nonetheless compared well with that of Winston Churchill, and also with later presidents when they were confronted with genocide abroad. Both books won prizes.\n\n In 2019 Public Affairs published a book by Breitman about a previously overlooked mid-level American consul and diplomat based in Berlin from 1930 to 1939, Raymond Geist. Despite his modest rank, Geist was superb at dealing with Nazi officials and for urging greater use of the U.S. immigration quota for Germany to help Jews escape from Nazi persecution. Geist personally provided a visa to Albert Einstein (and his wife) and helped extract Sigmund Freud from Vienna. In December 1938 Geist, who had a secret source high in the Gestapo, predicted the coming Holocaust. That he was secretly gay made Geist’s career and his achievements all the more remarkable.\n\nIn 1999 Breitman received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College, and in 2018 he was given a Distinguished Achievement Award from the Holocaust Educational Foundation.\n\nHe and his wife, Carol Rose (nee Wax), live in the Washington, DC area where he continues to write.\n\nPublications \n\nGerman Socialism and Weimar Democracy, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981\nWalter Laqueur and Richard Breitman, Breaking the Silence, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986.\nRichard Breitman and Alan Kraut, American Refugee Policy and European Jewry, 1933-1945, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987.\nThe Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution, New York: Alfred A.

The song was re-recorded by the band for their 2006 studio album, Boston VI: Live to Win, with the title \"Freedom Is a State of Mind (Live to Win)\". \"Freedom Is a State of Mind\" was the last song performed by Boston live, at the Hollywood RockWalk on September 1, 2007. In the liner notes of the 2000 Boston box set, Delp said of the song: \"This was the last song we wrote for Don't Look Back. We needed one more song to round out the album, and this one just fell together in the studio. It's one of those songs that is what it is, and it's hard to analyze.

Sherman and the theme song was written by Mel Leven and George Bruns, the latter of whom also composed the film's score. It was Neilson's fifth and final film he directed for Disney.\n\nPlot\nIn 1849, after Arabella Flagg is orphaned in Boston, her young brother Jack and the family's former butler Eric \"Bullwhip\" Griffin stow away aboard a ship bound for San Francisco, where the gold rush has begun. Griffin gets work as the ship's cook.\n\nA swindler and thief, Judge Higgins, steals a map to a gold mine belonging to Quentin Bartlett, an actor who is among the ship's passengers. Griffin, Jack and Bartlett all pursue the crooked judge while Arabella arrives in town and takes a job as a dancehall girl to make ends meet.\n\nGriffin encounters a stocky bully, Mountain Ox, and lashes out a punch that flattens him. \"Bullwhip\" becomes his new nickname.

Founded by Sue Broadway, Stephen Kent, David Spathaky and Sue Bradley while they were all working and staying together at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1984.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Guardian newspaper named them as one of the 25 most influential aspects of the 250 year history of circus in the West.\n\nThe first public performance was at the infamous Tunnel Club hosted by Malcolm Hardee in the East End of London. Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.\n\nTheir first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, \"Juggling With A Social Conscience\".\n\nThey subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of 'alternative' comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called 'Neo-circus or new variety by them or New Circus' by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, surrealist feel.\n\nProductions \n\nThey produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.\n\nThey notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.\n\nShows included:\n\nJuggling With A Social Conscience.\nMy Life on a Plate of Toast — Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage\nDomestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show\nStop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7 person theatre circus show\nFabulous Beasts - touring seven person theatre circus show\nGravity Swing- touring seven person theatre circus show\nAngels and Amazons - all woman 3 person clown show\nSwan - a community circus\nWhite Snake - A large scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music.\nCabinet of Curiosities - A 'chamber circus' - 4 people on stage\nBroadway Belles - All women cabaret show\nThe Mast - a site specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta.\nThe Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons end of season party.\n\nInfluence \nRa-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70's and the ritual theatre and 'Happenings' associated with the time notably the 'Grand Magic Circus', 'Circus Oz, 'The People Show', 'Cunning Stunts, 'The Festival of Fools' in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of 'theatre' as political activism.\n\nRa-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.\n\nFounder Sue Broadway  returned to lead Circus Oz  as Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nFounder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido.\nFounder Stephen Kent is a renowned musician and alongside his performing hosts a weekly radio show of world music.\n\nMark Digby and Ali Houiellebecq who met while in RRZ and formed 'La le les' which toured successfully for many years.\n\nLongtime member Lindsey Butcher, dancer, juggler and aerialist subsequently formed Gravity & Levity.\n\nSean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala left Ra-Ra Zoo in 1992 to form the Gandini Juggling\n\nMedia Visibility\nAlthough generally politically opposed to recorded media, the company performed on television on programs for young people such as 'No. 73', Blue Peter, guest spots on 'The Late Late Show' and elsewhere. They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan 'The Last Laugh before TVAM'. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate-spinning record.\n\nEarly Days\nIn early days they played on the emerging 'New Variety' and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.\n\nWorld Touring\nTheir extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.\n\nDeath or Resurrection?\n\nRa-Ra Zoo's last full show to date 'Cabinet of Curiosities' toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.\n\nReprise\nIn 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at The Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020  called 'Clown Power Live' at: http://zoological.ie, during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue Broadway & Dave Spathaky.\n\nReferences\n\nTheatre companies in England\nEdinburgh Festival performers", "machine_text": " Ra-Ra Zoo is an American animated television series that aired on CBS.

Ra-Ra, who is characterized by his designation as a \"Super Dog\", must foil the aliens' plots to take over the world, while trying to get his owner back. The series was produced by the same team as the animated series Darkwing Duck, and as such, the two shows share many of the same characters. In its original run, Ra-Ra Zoo was paired with The Mask: Animated Series on CBS's Saturday morning lineup, in the same time slot as the original series. The two shows were intended to complement each other, as they both featured similar humor and themes. However, the pairing was not successful, and both shows were cancelled after one season. The series is notable for its use of animal characters, who were designed to be easily distinguished from one another, and for its emphasis on physical comedy.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Choroidal neovascularization\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' macular degeneration) commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments.\n\nCauses\nCNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid. It is also associated with excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum and rarely with the more common optic disc drusen.  CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks.\n\nSymptoms\nCNV can create a sudden deterioration of central vision, noticeable within a few weeks. Other symptoms which can occur include color disturbances, and metamorphopsia (distortions in which straight lines appear wavy). Hemorrhaging of the new blood vessels can accelerate the onset of symptoms of CNV. CNV may also include the feeling of pressure behind your eye.\n\nUsing modern optical coherence tomography devices, it is possible to detect non-exudative neovascular membranes, that are typically asymptomatic.\n\nIdentification\nCNV can be detected by using a type of perimetry called preferential hyperacuity perimetry. On the basis of fluorescein angiography, CNV may be described as classic or occult. Two other tests that help identify the condition include indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography.\n\nTreatment\nCNV is conventionally treated with intravitreal injections of angiogenesis inhibitors (also known as \"anti-VEGF\" drugs) to control neovascularization and reduce the area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium.  Angiogenesis inhibitors include pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab (known by a variety of trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of vascular endothelial growth factor ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high.\n\nCNV may also be treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) coupled with a photosensitive drug such as verteporfin (Visudyne). The drug is given intravenously. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming thrombi. A Cochrane Review published in 2016 found that people with severe myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) may benefit from being given anti-VEGF treatment.\n\nSee also \nAge-related macular degeneration\nMacula\n\nReferences \n\nOphthalmology", "machine_text": " Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. The choroid is a thin layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the retina and the sclera. The choroid is designed to provide oxygen and nourishment to the outer layer of the retina. The new blood vessels that are created in CNV are weak and can break, causing blood to leak into the eye. The leaking blood can cause vision loss and even blindness if it happens in the area of the retina that is responsible for central vision. CNV can be caused by a number of diseases and conditions. The most common of these is age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD is a disease that causes the cells in the macula to break down, affecting the central vision. CNV is also associated with myopia, or nearsightedness, and with certain inflammatory diseases of the eye. CNV is typically treated with laser surgery. The procedure, called photocoagulation, uses a laser to create small burns in the area of the choroid with the new blood vessels. This can stop the blood vessels from leaking and can help to prevent further growth of the blood vessels. CNV can also be treated with medication that is injected into the eye. The medication, called anti-VEGF, blocks a protein that is responsible for the growth of new blood vessels. This can help to prevent the blood vessels from leaking and can also help to slow the growth of new blood vessels. In some cases, CNV can be treated with a procedure called photodynamic therapy. This procedure uses a drug that is injected into the bloodstream and is then activated with a laser to produce a chemical that can help to destroy the new blood vessels.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14330822}

It got released in September, exactly a year apart from the original release, and went to number eleven on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nCritical reception\nAndy Kastanas from The Charlotte Observer deemed it \"another good song that deserves a listen\". He added, \"This is much more downbeat than their earlier stuff, with easier vocals and a sound reminiscent of old Imagination or Enigma.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media called it \"slow disco\". A reviewer from Newcastle Evening Chronicle wrote that it's \"mesmerising\".\n\nChart performance\n\"Obsession\" was successful on the charts in Europe.

On the first day, Saint-Priest's Russians and General Friedrich Wilhelm von Jagow's Prussians easily captured Reims from its French National Guard garrison, capturing or killing more than half of its defenders. On the second day, an overconfident Saint-Priest carelessly deployed his forces west of the city, not grasping that Napoleon was approaching with 20,000 troops. Too late, Saint-Priest realized who he was fighting and tried to organize a retreat. In the battle that followed, the French army struck with crushing force and the Allies were routed with serious losses. During the fighting, Saint-Priest was struck by a howitzer shell and died two weeks later.\n\nBackground\nOn 9–10 March 1814, a 100,000-strong Allied army led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher defeated Emperor Napoleon's 39,000-man Imperial French army in the Battle of Laon. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded plus 2,500 men, 45 guns and 130 caissons captured. The Allies admitted only 744 casualties. Another source stated that the Allies sustained 4,000 casualties while inflicting 7,500 on the French. Early on the second day, Blücher was so ill with an eye infection that he temporarily handed over command to his chief of staff August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. Though Blücher had issued orders to attack the French that day, the new commander cancelled them. Consequently, Napoleon was able to disengage his battered army and withdraw almost unmolested to Soissons. Without Blücher's guiding hand, the Allied corps commanders began to clash with one another. Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg tried to resign his corps command and was only persuaded to remain by Blücher. \n\nAt dawn on 11 March, Napoleon's army began its retreat to Soissons where it formed for battle at 3:00 pm. Only 1,500 Russians mounted a pursuit and they were easily kept at bay by the French rearguard. The right wing of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, whose corps had been routed at Laon, retreated to Fismes. On 11–12 March Napoleon organized a defense at Soissons and issued orders for his eastern garrisons to break out and harass the Allied supply lines going back to the Rhine River. \n\nNot only did the French army suffer heavy casualties at Laon, it also lost between 5,400 and 8,000 men at the Battle of Craonne on 7 March. Napoleon assigned Marshal Édouard Mortier to command 8,000–9,000 infantry in the divisions of Joseph Boyer de Rébeval, Henri François Marie Charpentier, Charles-Joseph Christiani, Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial, Claude Marie Meunier, Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan and 4,000 cavalry in the divisions of Nicolas-François Roussel d'Hurbal and Louis Michel Pac, and a march regiment. One battalion of the Legion of the Vistula, 600 Polish lancers, three cavalry march regiments, two companies of coast guard gunners, two sapper companies and 1,000 conscripts arrived as reinforcements from Paris. A new cavalry unit called the Converged Squadrons Division was formed and assigned to Sigismond Frédéric de Berckheim. \n\nNapoleon disbanded the two Young Guard corps of Marshals Michel Ney and Claude Perrin Victor and Poret de Morvan's provisional division. Extra officers and non-coms were sent to Paris to recruit while the survivors were consolidated into the divisions of Curial and Charpentier. After reorganization, Mortier's 10,609-strong corps consisted of Christiani's 2,034 men, Curial's 2,796 men, Charpentier's 2,755 men, 2,062 cavalrymen and 962 gunners. The remainder of the army was formed into Marmont's 7,200 soldiers, Louis Friant's 3,600 Old Guards, Boyer de Rébeval's 3,000 men, the 2,400 sabers of the I Cavalry Corps, Berckheim's 1,700 horsemen and Horace Sebastiani's 4,400 guard cavalrymen.\n\nAllies capture Reims\nSaint-Priest, a French émigré, led the Russian 8th Infantry Corps, which was made up of the 11th and 17th Infantry Divisions. Each division consisted of four line infantry and two jäger regiments. At the beginning of 1814, the corps numbered 11,900 soldiers and formed part of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's 43,000-strong army corps. On 31 December 1813, the 8th Corps executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River near Koblenz. After this operation the corps advanced to Dinant on the Meuse River. On 15 February, Saint-Priest's corps was ordered to take over the Siege of Mainz. By early March, Saint-Priest had moved west to occupy Châlons-sur-Marne and Vitry-le-François. Fresh from the blockade of Erfurt, Jagow brought his Prussian brigade to join Saint-Priest.\n\nIn 1814, Reims had a population of 30,000 and was one of the most important cities of France. The city was surrounded by a wall and the Vesle River flowed through the city from southeast to northwest. The Soissons suburb was on an island to the southwest, opposite the city. Reims was  north of Châlons-sur-Marne and  east of Soissons. Napoleon was aware that Reims was in grave danger but he could only spare the Honor Guards cavalry division under Jean-Marie Defrance to watch the crossings of the Aisne River. The city's garrison was commanded by Jean Corbineau and was made up of 4,000 National Guards, a handful of line infantry and eight artillery pieces. Another authority asserted that the French garrison numbered only 1,256 infantry and 150 cavalry. These included details from the 15th, 43rd, 50th, 66th and 138th Line Infantry, 1st and 3rd Gardes d'Honneur, 2nd Eclaireurs and Guard artillery. \n\n \n\nSaint-Priest's force included the 8-battalion 11th Division led by Ivan Stepanovich Gurgalov, four battalions from the 17th Division under Igor Maximovich Pillar, two dragoon regiments commanded by Georgi Emmanuel, the 3-regiment 1st Horse Chasseur Division directed by Ivan Davidovich Pandschulishev and at least 12 guns. Attached to the force was Jagow's Prussian brigade which had three battalions each of the 1st Pommeranian (919 men) and 5th Kurmärk (810 men) Landwehr Regiments, one battalion each of the 3rd Pommeranian (380 men) and 2nd Neumark (263 men) Landwehr Regiments, elements of the 7th Kurmärk (77 sabers) and 1st West Prussian (41 sabers) Landwehr Cavalry Regiments, a battery with eight 6-pound cannons and a battery with six 7-pound howitzers. There were 7,800 Russians and 5,600 Prussians, including two 4-squadron regiments of Landwehr cavalry.\n\nThe three attacking columns assembled at Cormontreuil at 3:00 am on 12 March 1814. Emmanuel's column consisted of the Kiev Dragoons, Riazan Infantry Regiment and 33rd Jägers plus two Prussian battalions, two cannons and two howitzers. Pillar's column included the rest of the Russian infantry, 50 horsemen, two Prussian battalions and two howitzers. Jagow's column had six Prussian battalions 150 cavalry and 10 artillery pieces. Jagow's column assaulted Reims between the Épernay and Soissons roads, from the southwest. Covered by the fire of two 12-pound cannons, the Prussians broke into the city at the Paris gate. Pillar's column moved from the southeast along the north bank of the Vesle. The column under Emmanuel attacked from the northeast down the Rethel road, while the Kiev Dragoons and the Chernigov Horse Chasseurs stormed from the northwest down the Laon road. The attack was a complete surprise.   \n\nEmmanuel slowly pushed a Young Guard cadre back to the Place des Arcades. Meanwhile, Pillar's troops forced their way into the city by the Châlons gate and followed the edge of the city wall to get behind the French defenders. The Young Guards tried to fight their way through Pillar's men but were soon forced to surrender. A body of defenders tried to get away north to Berry-au-Bac but they were intercepted by Russian cavalry and over 200 survivors were captured. Some French defenders retreated to the northwest along the north bank of the Vesle. Though pursued by Allied horsemen, they escaped when Defrance's six squadrons of honor guards and hussars arrived in time to cover their withdrawal. Altogether, 2,500 French infantry and 11 guns fell into Allied hands in the city. A second source stated that 100 men of the 1,356-man garrison were killed and most of the remainder captured, including General Jean-Laurent Lacoste-Duvivier.\n\nEmmanuel deployed the Kiev Dragoons at La Neuvillette north of Reims. They clashed inconclusively with Defrance's cavalry for the remainder of the day. Saint-Priest was anxious to quickly establish contact with Blücher's army via Berry-au-Bac. The rest of the day was spent rounding up French soldiers trapped in the city. Saint-Priest's Russians camped inside Reims while Jagow's Prussians bivouacked in the villages on the west side of the city. Scouts were sent as far west as Fismes but patrolling was not aggressive. The Russian commander was aware of the Allied victory at Laon and did not expect any trouble. When he heard that Reims had fallen, Gneisenau asserted that the French were not capable of quickly retaking the city.\n\nBattle\n\nApproach march\n\nWhen Napoleon heard that Saint-Priest captured Reims he realized that he might score a cheap victory over the Allies. A success at Reims would cut the link between the army Blücher to the north and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Allied army to the south. The war was going badly for Napoleon. Marshal Jacques MacDonald was falling back before Schwarzenberg, Eugène de Beauharnais was in a tight spot in Italy, Marshal Pierre Augereau was losing territory in the south. The political situation also appeared dire. The Allies were negotiating the Treaty of Chaumont in order to more closely bind their alliance against the French emperor and the French people were tired of the war. Napoleon needed a quick victory to restore his reputation. The emperor wrote, \"My intention being to attack Saint-Priest near Reims tomorrow, to defeat him and reoccupy the town\".\n\nNapoleon left Mortier with 8,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to hold Soissons. Augustin Daniel Belliard led Mortier's cavalry which included a brigade from Berckheim's division. Mortier was instructed to defend the Aisne on either side of Soissons but not to allow himself to be drawn into a general battle. Napoleon ordered Marmont with the VI Corps and the I Cavalry Corps to march from Fismes toward Reims starting on the morning of 13 March. They would be followed by all the Guard Cavalry, Friant's division, Pierre François Xavier Boyer's brigade and the Legion of the Vistula battalion. The stage was set for the French soldiers to do some epic marching. Friant began his march from Soissons at 2:00 am and arrived before Reims at 4:00 pm, while Marmont set out from Fismes at 6:00 am. Ney's infantry started from Soissons around 8:00 pm and got to Reims before 4:00 pm. Napoleon set out from Soissons with the Guard cavalry service squadrons.\n\nÉtienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's I Cavalry Corps led Marmont's advance. After obtaining local guides, the column left the main road at Jonchery-sur-Vesle and followed a route through Sapicourt to Rosnay. At Rosnay, they surprised several squadrons of Prussian cavalry which fled in a panic. One battalion of the 3rd Pommeranian Landwehr Regiment was at Rosny while a second battalion was at Muizon on the Vesle. The 5th Kurmärk Landwehr had one battalion at Gueux and a second one at Thillois. The battalion in Rosnay fell back fighting to Gueux and finally to Ormes. While defending themselves in the Ormes cemetery, the Prussians were overwhelmed by Pierre Pelleport's infantry brigade; many surrendered while others were cut down by the 10th Hussars and the 1st Gardes d'Honneur from Cyrille Simon Picquet's cavalry brigade. While he was inspecting a camp at Gueux, Jagow was surprised by French cavalry and galloped away on an unsaddled horse. Caught unaware as they cooked supper, many of the Prussians at Muizon and Thillois left their shoes and coats behind in their flight.\n\nSaint-Priest deployed his Allied troops on the west side of Reims in a double line supported by 24 field guns. His right flank rested on the Vesle River, his center on the Tinqueux heights and his left flank at the La Muire ravine. The 1st Pommeranian Landwehr and 12 guns were posted near Bezannes on the left. One battalion of the Neumark Landwehr was at Cormontreuil while a second battalion guarded the bridge at Sillery to the southeast of Reims. The Prussian cavalry deployed on the far left while Russian cavalry held the far right flank. Saint-Priest established an artillery battery on the Sainte-Geneviève plateau which was supported by the Riazan Infantry, the 1st and 33rd Jagers and the Kharkov and Kiev Dragoons. This force was placed under the direction of Adam Ivanovich Bistrom. Saint-Priest was still convinced that the French activity was a simple reconnaissance.\n\nAssault\n\nBordesoulle's horsemen began pressing back Bistrom's troops. In the early afternoon, Napoleon reached the battlefield. Since the infantry under Ney and Friant had not yet arrived, the French emperor instructed Bordesoulle and Defrance to withdraw a little and ordered the cannons to cease fire. The lack of serious action satisfied Saint-Priest that he had nothing to worry about. The Russian commander gave no orders to move the corps wagon train which was parked in Reims. He believed his defenses were manned in sufficient strength. By 4:00 pm Ney and Friant were on hand. With evening only two hours away, Napoleon ordered an immediate attack. \n\nDefrance's cavalry and Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's infantry division led the assault. The Guard cavalry divisions of Rémi Joseph Isidore Exelmans and Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais, under the direction of Sebastiani, advanced on Ricard's flanks. Farther south, Bordesoulle's divisions moved toward Bezannes with Christophe Antoine Merlin's division leading. Bordesoulle's thrust was designed to prevent the Prussians from retreating to the southeast via Sillery. The French artillery took position at Croix-Saint-Pierre to the north of the Soissons road while Friant and Pierre Boyer were held in reserve. Ricard's division crossed the La Muire ravine and forced its way onto the Sainte-Geneviève heights, splitting the center of the Allied line and forcing the Russians back toward Reims. \n\nThe violence of the assault convinced Saint-Priest that he was facing Napoleon himself. He hastily ordered his second line to retreat through Reims in the direction of Laon. The Russian commander directed his wagon train to go south to Châlons and asked Bistrom to cover the withdrawal. The retrograde movement of the Prussians through the Reims suburb became confused and Jagow was unable to unsnarl it. When Saint-Priest and his staff rode to a place between the Soissons road and Tinqueux village, they drew fire from the French artillery on the Croix-Saint-Pierre heights. Saint-Priest was hit in the shoulder by a howitzer shell and thrown senseless from his horse. A second source stated that the projectile was a solid shot. The next ranking officer, Pandschulishev was injured earlier in the day. Unable to mount a horse, he stayed behind in Reims. After witnessing Saint-Priest being struck down, Emmanuel should have assumed command of the troops. Instead, he \"lost his head\" and rode back into Reims to ask Pandschulishev what he ought to do. The Allied command structure went to pieces. \n\nThe Allied withdrawal soon degenerated into a scramble to safety as cannons were left behind and some foot soldiers jettisoned equipment in order to get away more rapidly. Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur led the 3rd Gardes d'Honneur, some cuirassiers and the 14th Young Guard Battery in a charge that forced some Russian dragoons into the Vesle. However, the Riazan Regiment, bearing the unconscious body of Saint-Priest, maintained its discipline. Pandschulishev ordered six battalions to hold the city walls. Caught between Russians manning the Reims defenses and the withdrawing Riazan Regiment, Ségur's horsemen were trapped and shot down by the score. Next, Ricard's infantry tried to storm the Soissons gate but were driven back by intense musketry. Marmont ordered a battalion into the houses near the walls and instructed the soldiers to pick off the defenders.\n\nSkirmishing went on until 11:00 pm when artillery was wheeled into position to fire on the gate. Though a number of gunners were shot down by the Russian defenders, 16 cannons of the Guard artillery blew open the gate in a furious barrage. Cuirassiers charged into Reims and soon cleared the streets of the Allies. Napoleon and his staff entered Reims at midnight. Another source stated that Napoleon's entrance was an hour later and added that the townspeople turned out to welcome him. Meanwhile, utilizing a bridging train, Exelmans' division and some Polish horsemen crossed the Vesle and headed for the road to Berry-au-Bac. They waded into the retreating column of Jagow and Emmanuel, turning it into a fleeing mob. When Jagow arrived at Berry-au-Bac early on 14 March he reported having only two intact battalions.\n\nResults\n\nNapoleon claimed in his battle report that the gunner who fatally wounded Saint-Priest was the same one who killed Jean Victor Marie Moreau at the Battle of Dresden. Historian Digby Smith wrote that French casualties in the recapture of Reims were about 900. The Russians lost 1,400 men and 12 guns, while the Prussians suffered casualties of 1,300 men and 10 guns. George Nafziger stated that the French suffered 700–800 casualties including a badly-wounded Ségur. Nafziger listed Allied losses as 700–800 dead, 1,500–1,600 wounded and 2,500–3,500 captured, along with 11–14 guns and 100 caissons or wagons. The Prussians admitted losses of 1,300 infantry, 85 cavalry, six howitzers and four cannons. David G. Chandler asserted that the French inflicted 6,000 casualties on the Allies while sustaining losses of 700. While the French army brought 20,000 to 25,000 troops onto the battlefield, no more than 10,000 were actually employed against the 14,500 Allies. \n\nNapoleon spent three days at Reims following his victory. With Blücher still recovering from sickness, Gneisenau did not trouble the French during that time. The French emperor sent Ney to seize Châlons-sur-Marne, which was done without opposition. Ney was joined by Jan Willem Janssens who gathered 3,000 men from the Ardennes garrisons. Meanwhile, Schwarzenberg's army advanced perilously close to Paris. Napoleon's problem was to lure the Allied army away from Paris. He decided to leave Marmont and Mortier with 21,000 soldiers to watch Blücher and move south toward Arcis-sur-Aube to threaten Schwarzenberg's supply line. The Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube was fought on 20–21 March 1814.\n\nNapoleon had achieved a remarkable victory with troops whose morale had suffered due to heavy casualties at Craonne and the defeat at Laon. According to the historian F.W.O. Maycock, success at Reims was, \"surely one of the greatest triumphs of [Napoleon's] remarkable career, and speaks volumes for his powers as a leader of men\". Napoleon once again interposed between the forces of Blücher and Schwarzenberg, putting him in position to move on the latter's line of communications.\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n NapoleonGames\n Live d'Or\n War and Champagne\n\n1814 in France\nBattles of the Napoleonic Wars\nBattles of the War of the Sixth Coalition\nReims 1814\nBattles involving France\nBattles involving Prussia\nBattles involving Russia\nConflicts in 1814\nMarch 1814 events", "machine_text": " Battle of Reims (1814) The Battle of Reims was a battle during the Hundred Days phase of the Napoleonic Wars. It took place on 13 February 1814 and was a victory for the French under Marshals Marmont and Mortier against the Allies under Prince Schwarzenberg. After Napoleon's abdication, the French garrisons in the occupied Netherlands were withdrawn to France to help defend the country against the advancing Allies. As the Allied forces advanced into northern France, they won a number of victories, and by early February they were approaching the city of Reims. The French troops in the city were under the command of General Jean-Claude Falck, who decided to make a stand there. He was joined by two Marshals, Marmont and Mortier, who took over the command. The Allies were commanded by Prince Schwarzenberg. After some initial successes by the Allies, the French counter-attacked and drove them back. The Allies were forced to retreat to the east, leaving Reims to the French. The battle was a victory for the French, although they had only around 30,000 men at the start of the battle, while the Allies had around 100,000. After the battle, the French pursued the Allies back to the Aisne river.

These include the Delaram-Zaranj Highway in Afghanistan, completed and handed over to the Afghan government during 2008, and the restoration of the Farkhor and Ayni air bases in Tajikistan.\n\nBorder infrastructure development \n\nIn response to the ever-present security threat from Pakistan and increased incursions and rapid border infrastructure from China, India too is undertaking border infrastructure development.\n\nBorder roads \n\nAs per July 2017 update to Lok Sabha from the Government of India, construction of 73 completed strategic roads along the Sino-India border was approved in 2005 with an initial and currently revised deadlines of 2012-2013 and 2019-2020 respectively, including 43 by the Ministry of Defence and 27 by the Ministry of Home Affairs, of which only 21 roads by March 2017 and 30 roads by July 2017 have been completed and remaining are under construction as progress was slowed down due to wildlife conservation and environmental approval, insurgency related security hurdles, delay in land acquisition by the states, inaccessible terrain, inclement weather, etc. BRO is constructing 63 out of these 73 roads as it costs BRO  to  per km compared to  to\n per km of road construction by the private companies. In two years alone, 2015–16 and 2016–17, prime minister Narendra Modi's government has allocated more than US$4.7 billion in contracts for the development of border roads, which also includes the US$256 million  India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway from Moreh in Manipur through Tamu, Myanmar to Mae Sot in Thailand.\n\nIn July 2020, BRO was also tasked with building new roads to connect eastern Bhutan to westen Tawang area such as Lumla-Trashigang road through Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nRoad bridges\nTo provide multiple points of alternative connectivity to the forces, BRO is building 410 2-lane class-70 (heavy load bearing including tanks) road bridges along the 3,440 km long McMahon Line border with China, including 144 in Arunachal Pradesh (75 already under construction and will be completed by 2020), 100 under construction in Jammu and Kashmir, 55 under construction in Uttrakhand, 40 under construction in Sikkim and 25 under construction in Himachal Pradesh (c. Dec 2017). The annual pace of construction is 3 km of bridges (c. Dec 2017). On 12 October 2020 Defense Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated 44 new bridges.\n\nBorder tunnels \n\nIn November 2017 BRO announced the plan to construct 17 road and rail tunnels, with a total length of 100 km, on some of the 73 strategic roads on Sino-Indian border to provide the year-round all-weather rail and road surface connectivity. Currently, surface access to high altitude posts on Sino-India border is closed for six months every year due to snowfall and rain, and supplies are through air lift only. Some of these 17 tunnels are already under construction, including Srinagar-Kargil-Leh NH1 in J&K (Zoji La pass tunnel), Leh-Manali Highway in J&K and Himachal Pradesh (Lungalacha La, Bara-lacha la, Tanglang La, Shingo La near Nimo and Rohtang Tunnel), 578 meter Theng Pass tunnel on NH310A between Chungthang and Tung in North Sikkim, Nechipu Pass (near Bomdila) and Sela Pass tunnels on Bogibeel Assam to Sagalee to Tawang NH13 in Arunachal Pradesh. This will reduce the travel time and operational costs, eliminate the risk of avalanche and landslide.\n\nDecorations\nAwards attained by BRO personnel between 1960 and 31 January 2020:\n\n 23 × Kirti Chakra\n 218 × Shaurya Chakra\n 2 × Bar to Shaurya Chakra\n 2 × Padam Shree\n 16 × Param Vishisht Seva Medals\n 43 × Ati Vishist Seva Medals\n 110 × Vishisht Seva Medals\n 25 × Sena Medals\n 3 × Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak\n 17 × Uttam Jeevan Raksha Padak\n 69 × Jeevan Raksha Padak\n\nIn 2009, eight Shaurya Chakras, all posthumous, were awarded to BRO personnel for their actions in places such as Afghanistan, Sikkim, the north-east and Jammu and Kashmir. Bulldozer operator Zalim Singh, Bar to the Shaurya Chakra, was crushed by boulders while clearing a strategic road for Indian Army tanks. Two BRO men working on BRO's Project Zaranj in Afghanistan were killed during a suicide bomb attack on Zaranj-Delaram highway. Engineer Santosh Kumar Singh and driver Jaikrit Singh Rawat, while working on the Kishtwar-Sinthan Pass, died in an ambush. Others died or were killed in places such as Meghalaya, Kailash Mansarovar, Kali River and Hapoli Sarli-Huri road.\n\nRecognition \nIn November 2021, BRO received a Guinness World Record for the \"highest altitude road\" following construction at Umling La.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\n India-China Border Roads\n Project HIMANK\nIndian Army Corps of Engineers\nTrans-Arunachal Highway\nMago-Thingbu to Vijaynagar Border Road\nChota Char Dham Railway\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n1960 establishments in Delhi\nGovernment agencies established in 1960\nMilitary of India\nExecutive branch of the government of India\nRoads in India\nBorder Roads Organisation", "machine_text": " Border Roads Organisation The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is a road construction and maintenance sector of the Indian Army.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Dissolution of Czechoslovakia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Dissolution of Czechoslovakia (, ) took effect on January 1, 1993, and was the self-determined split of the federal republic of Czechoslovakia into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both mirrored the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, which had been created in 1969 as the constituent states of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic.\n\nIt is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989, which had led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nBackground\n\nCzechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. In 1918, a meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, at which the future Czechoslovak President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and other Czech and Slovak representatives signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, which promised a common state consisting of two equal nations: Slovaks and Czechs. Soon afterward, he and Edvard Beneš violated the agreement by pushing for greater unity and a single nation.\n\nSome Slovaks were not in favour of that change, and in March 1939, with pressure from Adolf Hitler, the First Slovak Republic was created as a satellite state of Germany with limited sovereignty. The alignment with the Soviet Union after World War II oversaw the reunification into the Third Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nIn 1968, the Constitutional Law of Federation reinstated an official federal structure of the 1917 type, but during the Normalization Period in the 1970s, Gustáv Husák, despite being a Slovak himself, returned most of control to Prague. That approach encouraged a regrowth of separatism after the fall of communism.\n\nSeparation\n\nBy 1991, the Czech Republic's GDP per capita was some 20% higher than Slovakia's. Transfer payments from the Czech budget to Slovakia, which had been the rule in the past, were stopped in January 1991.\n\nMany Czechs and Slovaks desired the continued existence of a federal Czechoslovakia. Some major Slovak parties, however, advocated a looser form of coexistence and the Slovak National Party sought complete independence and sovereignty. For a few years, political parties re-emerged, but Czech parties had little or no presence in Slovakia and vice versa. To have a functioning state, the government demanded continued control from Prague, but Slovaks continued to ask for decentralisation.\n\nIn 1992, the Czech Republic elected Václav Klaus and others, who demanded either an even tighter federation (\"viable federation\") or two independent states. Vladimír Mečiar and other leading Slovak politicians wanted a kind of confederation. Both sides opened frequent and intense negotiations in June. On July 17, the Slovak parliament adopted the declaration of independence of the Slovak nation. Six days later, Klaus and Mečiar agreed to dissolve Czechoslovakia at a meeting in Bratislava. Czechoslovak President Václav Havel resigned, rather than oversee the dissolution, which he had opposed. In a September 1992 opinion poll, only 37% of Slovaks and 36% of Czechs favoured dissolution.\n\nThe goal of negotiations switched to achieving a peaceful division. Peaceful division was prioritized as the process ran in parallel with the violent breakup of Yugoslavia (another socialist, Slavic federal state created after the Dissolution of Austria-Hungary) such an outbreak in Czechoslovakia was undesired. On November 13, the Federal Assembly passed Constitution Act 541, which settled the division of property between the Czech lands and Slovakia. With Constitution Act 542, passed on November 25, they agreed to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia as of December 31, 1992.\n\nThe separation occurred without violence and so was thus said to be \"velvet\", much like the \"Velvet Revolution\", which had preceded it and had been accomplished by massive peaceful demonstrations and actions. In contrast, other post-communist breakups (such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia) involved violent conflict. Czechoslovakia is the only former Eastern bloc state that had an entirely-peaceful breakup. In the following years, as Slovakia's economy struggled, Slovaks began to describe the dissolution as a \"sandpaper divorce\".\n\nCauses\nA number of reasons have been given for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, with the main debates focusing on whether dissolution was inevitable or whether dissolution occurred in conjunction with or even in contrast to the events that occurred between the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the end of the joined state in 1992.\n\nThose who argue from the inevitability stance tend to point to the differences between the two nations, which date back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and to other issues. There are ethnic differences between the Czechs and Slovaks, such as problems with the shared state during communism, the success of the state in the Czech lands and its failure in the Slovak lands that still resulted in the adoption of communism since the Czechs were more influential in the running of the state than Slovaks, and the 1968 constitution with its minority veto.\n\nThose who argue that events between 1989 and 1992 led to the dissolution point to international factors such as the breakaway of the Soviet satellite nations, the lack of unified media between Czechia and Slovakia, and most importantly the actions of the political leaders of both nations like the disagreements between Prime Ministers Klaus and Mečiar.\n\nLegal aspects\n\nNational symbols\nSince the coat of arms of Czechoslovakia was a composition of those of the historic geographic areas forming the country, each republic simply kept its own symbol: the Czechs the lion and the Slovaks the double cross. The same principle was applied to the two-part bilingual Czechoslovak national anthem that comprised two separate pieces of music, the Czech stanza Kde domov můj and the Slovak stanza Nad Tatrou sa blýska. Disputes occurred only with respect to the Czechoslovak flag. During the 1992 negotiations on the details of dissolution of Czechoslovakia, as demanded by Vladimír Mečiar and Václav Klaus, a clause forbidding the use of the state symbols of Czechoslovakia by its successor states was inserted into the constitutional law on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, the red and white flag of Bohemia (differing from the Polish flag only by the proportion of the colours) officially served as the flag of the Czech Republic. Eventually, after a search for new symbols, the Czech Republic unilaterally decided to ignore the constitutional law on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia (Article 3 of Law 542/1992 stated that the \"Czech Republic and Slovak Republic shall not use the national symbols of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic after its dissolution.\") and to keep the Czechoslovak flag, with an altered meaning. Slovakia, meanwhile, adopted its traditional flag; however, just before independence, on September 3, 1992, the coat of arms was added to prevent confusion with the similar flags of Russia and Slovenia.\n\nTerritory\nThe national territory was divided along the existing internal borders, but the border was not clearly defined at some points and, in some areas, the border cut across streets, access roads and communities that had coexisted for centuries. The most serious issues occurred around the following areas:\n\nU Sabotů or Šance (:cs:Šance (Vrbovce)) – historically part of Moravia, awarded to Slovakia in 1997\nSidonie or Sidónia (:cs:Sidonie) – historically part of Hungary (which contained all present-day Slovak territory until 1918), awarded to the Czech Republic in 1997\nKasárna (:cs:Kasárna (Makov)) recreational area – historically Moravian, disputed between Moravia and Hungary since the 16th century, formally part of Hungary since 1734; accessible by car only from the Czech side until early 2000s; remained in Slovakia despite heavy objections from the mostly-Czech property owners, whose real estate effectively fell into a foreign country.\n\nThe new countries were able to solve the difficulties via mutual negotiations, financial compensation and then an international treaty covering the border modifications.\n\nPeople living or owning property in the border area, however, continued to experience practical problems until both new countries entered the Schengen Agreement Area in 2007, rendering the border less significant.\n\nDivision of national property\nMost federal assets were divided in a ratio of two to one, the approximate ratio between the Czech and Slovak population in Czechoslovakia, including army equipment, rail and airliner infrastructure. Some minor disputes, such as gold reserves stored in Prague and federal know-how valuation, lasted for a few years after the dissolution.\n\nCurrency division\n\nInitially, the old Czechoslovak currency, the Czechoslovak koruna, remained in use by both countries. Czech fears of an economic loss caused the adoption of two national currencies as early as February 8, 1993. At the beginning, the currencies had an equal exchange rate, but the value of the Slovak koruna was then usually lower than that of the Czech koruna (in 2004, around 25–27% lower). On August 2, 1993, both currencies were distinguished by different stamps that were first affixed to and then printed on old Czechoslovak koruna banknotes.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro as its currency with an exchange rate of 30.126 SK/€, and the €2 commemorative coin for 2009, Slovakia's first, featured the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in remembrance of the common struggle of the Czechoslovaks for democracy. By a quirk of fate, the welcoming speech on the behalf of the European Union on the occasion of Slovakia's entry to the eurozone was delivered by Mirek Topolánek, the prime minister of the presiding country, the Czech Republic, naturally in his native language, but the other guest speakers used English. The Czech Republic continues to use the Czech koruna, or crown.\n\nInternational law\nNeither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia sought recognition as the sole successor state to Czechoslovakia. This can be contrasted to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Russian Federation was recognised as successor state to not only the Russian SFSR but also the Soviet Union itself. Therefore, Czechoslovakia's membership in the United Nations ceased upon the dissolution of the country, but on January 19, 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were admitted as new, separate states.\n\nWith respect to other international treaties, the Czechs and the Slovaks agreed to honour the treaty obligations of Czechoslovakia. The Slovaks transmitted a letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations on May 19, 1993, to express their intent to remain a party to all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia and to ratify treaties signed but not ratified before dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The letter acknowledged that under international law, all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia would remain in force. For example, both countries are recognised as signatories of the Antarctic Treaty from the date that Czechoslovakia had signed the agreement in 1962.\n\nBoth countries have ratified the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, but it was not a factor in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia since it did not come into force until 1996.\n\nAftermath\n\nEconomy\n\nThe dissolution had some negative impact on the two economies, especially in 1993, as traditional links were severed to accommodate the bureaucracy of international trade, but the impact was considerably less than expected by many people.\n\nA customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia remained in place from the dissolution until May 1, 2004, when both countries entered the European Union.\n\nMany Czechs hoped that dissolution would quickly start an era of high economic growth in the Czech Republic, which no longer had to sponsor the \"less-developed Slovakia\". Similarly, others looked forward to an independent unexploited Slovakia that might become a new \"economic tiger\".\n\nAccording to The Prague Post, \"Slovak GDP reached 95 percent of the Czech GDP, and it is likely to draw level with it. The Slovak gross national product (GNP), which includes citizens' incomes abroad and deducts the money multinational companies move out of the country, is higher than the Czech one. Old-age pensions are more or less at the same level in both countries, and the consumption per capita is slightly higher in Slovakia. However, salaries are 10 percent lower on average in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic\".\n\nHowever, Martin Filko, the head of the Institute of Financial Policy of the Slovak Finance Ministry, pointed out that Slovakia is among the EU countries whose salaries form the lowest portion of their GDP. In other words, some of people's incomes come from sources other than their main employment, which reduces the real difference between the Czech and the Slovak salaries.\n\nSlovakia has higher political stability than the Czech Republic. As of 2018, Slovaks have had only four prime ministers since 1998, but the Czechs have had ten. Slovaks have become a more integral part of the EU because of their adoption of the euro and are more resolved to take part in the banking and fiscal unions. In the Czech Republic, the right wing opened the economy, and the left wing privatised banks and attracted foreign investors.\n\nUntil 2005, the GDP of the two countries was growing at a similar rate. However, from 2005 to 2008, the Slovak economy grew faster than the Czech economy. Economists agree that this growth was caused by the right-wing reforms of the Mikuláš Dzurinda government and the promise to adopt the euro, which attracted investors.\n\nWhen the left-wing populist Robert Fico replaced Dzurinda as Slovak prime minister after eight years in 2006, he reduced the right-wing reforms only moderately, but he did not abolish them, unlike the Czech Social Democrats (ČSSD).\n\nMeanwhile, the Czechs had three ČSSD prime ministers in four years (2002–06), followed by a shaky centre-right cabinet, which cut and simplified taxes but failed to push through other reforms and did not want to adopt the euro because of the financial crisis and the Civic Democrats' ideological stance.\n\nCitizenship\nSince federalisation in 1968, Czechoslovakia had divided citizenship, either of the Czech Socialist Republic or of the Slovak Socialist Republic, the word Socialist being dropped from both names shortly after the Velvet Revolution. That distinction, however, had little effect on citizens' life. On January 1, 1993, all Czechoslovak citizens automatically became citizens either of the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic, based on their previous citizenship, permanent residence address, birthplace, family ties, job and other criteria. Additionally, people had one year's time to claim the other citizenship under certain conditions.\n\nSlovak legislation allowed dual citizenship until 2010, when it was abolished (see Citizenship Act (Slovakia)). Only a handful of people have exercised that right, but its significance is lessened by both nations' membership in the EU as the freedom of movement for workers, a policy that guarantees EU citizens the right to work and to live anywhere in the Union. In the case of movement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the policy took effect from 2004.\n\nBy contrast, the Czech Republic has prohibited dual citizenship for naturalized citizens and requires them to give up existing citizenship(s) prior to receiving citizenship of the Czech Republic. That requirement can be waived only if giving up an existing citizenship might put the applicant or their relatives in danger of persecution in their homeland, which was not the case of applicants from Slovakia. That situation changed with the new Citizenship Act of 2013 (186/2013 Sb.), in force since January 1, 2014. However, most Slovak citizens are still unable to become dual citizens of both the Czech Republic and Slovakia since they automatically lose Slovak citizenship upon voluntarily acquiring another one (see previous paragraph). Exempt from that law are only Slovak citizens who obtain a foreign citizenship by virtue of marriage with a foreign national. Some Slovak politicians have speculated in the media about softening the Citizenship Act, but no change has yet materialised as of January 2015.\n\nPeople of both countries were allowed to cross the border without a passport and were allowed to work anywhere without the need to obtain an official permit. Border checks were completely removed on December 21, 2007, when both countries joined the Schengen Agreement.\n\nUnder the current European regulations, citizens of either country are entitled to the diplomatic protection of any other EU country and so both have been considering merging their embassies, together with nations of the Visegrád Group, to reduce costs.\n\nRoma people\nOne of the problems not solved during dissolution was the question of a large number of Romani living in the Czech Republic born and officially registered in today's Slovakia. Most of them did not re-register their official place of stay during the months before dissolution and so the question of their citizenship was left open. The 1992 Czech Nationality Act allowed a grant of automatic citizenship only to those who were born on Czech territory. For others, the right to citizenship required proof of a five-year period of residence, an \"unobjectionable\" criminal record, significant fees and a complicated bureaucratic process, which reportedly excluded a rather large percentage of Roma.\n\nThe Slovak government did not want to grant citizenship to nonresidents. Significant numbers of Roma living in Czech orphanages did not have their legal status clarified and were released from care as adult noncitizens without any right to work or live in the Czech Republic. Under pressure from the European Union, the Czech government made amendments to its nationality law in 1999 and 2003, which effectively solved the problem, but compensation has not been provided to those rendered stateless in 1992.\n\nLanguage contacts\n\nIn the former Czechoslovakia, the first television channel was a federal one and Czech and Slovak were languages that were used in equal ratios in the television news there, but foreign films and television series were almost exclusively dubbed into Czech, for example. That and the fact that the two languages are very similar made almost all people of both nations passively bilingual: they could understand but not necessarily speak the other language. After the dissolution in 1990s, the new television channels in the Czech Republic practically stopped using Slovak, and young Czech people now have a much lower understanding of Slovak. Also, the number of Slovak-language books and newspapers sold in the Czech Republic dropped drastically. The Czech television news, however, started to reintroduce Slovak-language coverage from Slovakia and Slovak television (STV2) rebroadcasts the Czech television newscast Události ČT daily, ten minutes after midnight.\n\nOn the public Radio and Television of Slovakia, it is common to have at least one daily newscast from the Czech Republic during prime time news. Furthermore, many programmes on Slovak television channels are still dubbed into Czech, some films in cinemas are subtitled in Czech and there are far more Czech-language books and periodicals on the market than there were before the dissolution. The major boost for the language interchange has come from private television channel providers like CS Link (Czech Republic) and Sky Link (Slovakia) that offer Slovak channels in the Czech Republic and vice versa. Additionally, several channels, regardless of their national origin, offer programs both in Czech and Slovak (CSFilm, TV Barrandov) or even mix like TV Nova's Nova Sport coverage of the English Premier League. New impulses to mutual contacts coming via television are also common shows like the Intelligence Test of Nations, Czechoslovakia's Got Talent, and Masked Singer broadcast by PRIMA and TV JOJ, and Czecho-Slovak SuperStar, the latter being the first international edition of the Pop Idol song contest broadcast by TV Nova and Markíza (both owned by CME), which also organized joint versions of MasterChef and The Voice in 2012. Also, the New Year's Eve Program for 2009 was prepared and broadcast jointly by ČT and STV and for 2010 by the Czech TV PRIMA and the Slovak TV JOJ, this time even including the singing of the Czechoslovak national anthem.\n\nYoung Slovak people still have the same knowledge of Czech as their predecessors, if not better. In Slovakia, Czech may still be used automatically in all judicial proceedings, and all documents written in Czech are acknowledged by Slovak authorities and vice versa. Further, the Slovak Official Language Act, passed in 2009, reconfirmed the right of Czechs to use their language in all official communication when dealing with Slovak authorities although it explicitly limited the use of Czech in Slovakia to persons with Czech as their mother tongue. The same is true about using the Slovak language in the Czech Republic because of the Administration Procedure Act of 2004. Gustáv Slamečka, a Slovak citizen who was the Czech transport minister (2009–2010), used only Slovak exclusively during his official communication.\n\nSee also differences between Slovak and Czech languages.\n\nSport\nThe official breakup occurred right in the middle of the 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, which took place in Sweden. The team representing Czechoslovakia was renamed \"Czech–Slovak\" on January 1. In international ice hockey tournaments, the Czech Republic took over Czechoslovakia's place in the A-groups, and Slovakia had to start in the lower divisions.\n\nDuring the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1993 in Falun, Sweden, the ski jumping team competed as a combined Czech–Slovakia team in the team large hill event and won silver. The team had been selected prior to the dissolution. Jaroslav Sakala won two medals in the individual hill events for the Czech Republic at those games along with his silver in the team event.\n\nIn their qualifying section for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Czechoslovakia national football team competed under the name RCS, which stood for \"Representation of Czechs and Slovaks\". It was afterward that it was officially split up into Czech and Slovak national teams. The team failed to qualify after it got only a draw in its final match against Belgium, a match that it needed to win to qualify.\n\nThe mutual encounters between the national teams of both countries in many sports are followed by most of the populations, and the number of players and coaches active in the other republic is significant. Martin Lipták, a Slovak handball coach, successfully led the Czech national team to the EHF 2010 Handball European Championship in Austria. A Slovak team under his coaching, Tatran Prešov, won the Czech national league in 2008 and 2009. Czech ice hockey coach Vladimír Vůjtek led the Slovak national team to the silver medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship, having beaten the Czech team in the semifinals.\n\nSeveral sports have featured a common league, and discussions about having a common football or ice hockey league continue.\n\nThe road cyclist Ján Svorada earned Slovak citizenship in 1993. In 1994, he became the first Slovak rider ever to win a Tour de France stage. Two years later, he earned Czech citizenship, and he became the first Czech rider ever to win another Tour de France stage in 1998.\n\nTelecommunications\nThe two successor states continued to use the country code +42 until February 1997, when it was replaced by two separate codes: +420 for the Czech Republic and +421 for Slovakia. Since then, telephone calls between both countries have required international dialing.\n\nLegacy\nPublic perception of the dissolution has not changed much, with a December 2017 poll showing that just 42% of Czechs and 40% of Slovaks agree with what happened (compared to 36% and 37% in 1992, respectively). According to the Czech political analyst Lubomir Kopeček, many Czechs and Slovaks view the breakup process unfavourably because they had no say in the matter, and most would have rather had a referendum decide. In 2015, a Slovak movement called \"Czechoslovakia 2018\" was established to try to get a referendum by 2018. Its leader, Ladislav Zelinka, said that he had received thousands of emails and calls from supporters, but it was unable to reach the necessary 350,000 petition signatures. The younger generations of both countries are largely indifferent to the issue since they never experienced the previous period themselves, and older generations are more focused on present issues such as immigration and favour their own separate nationalism.\n\nSurveys from 2010 showed that the majority of the population of Prague (Czechs) still considers the division of the country a mistake; similarly, the general representative survey in Slovakia (from 2008) showed that society is still divided in opinion on the dissolution, with 47% favouring the dissolution and 44% considering it a mistake.\n\nPolitical influences between the countries are minimal, but social democrats tend to cooperate very closely on regional and European topics in recent years. Furthermore, it has become customary that the elected presidents pay their first and last official foreign visits during their term to the other republic of the former Czechoslovakia. Appointed foreign ministers tend to follow that unwritten rule. On October 29, 2012, to commemorate Czechoslovakia's declaration of independence, which occurred on October 28, 1918, the Czech and the Slovak governments held, for the first time, a joint cabinet meeting in the communities of Trenčín and Uherské Hradiště, near the common border.\n\nAlso, peacekeeping troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia were put under joint command on several occasions. For example, from 2002 to July 2005, the Czech Armed Forces joined with the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic to form a joint Czech–Slovak KFOR battalion in Kosovo, which contributed to the Multinational Brigade CENTRE. Trade relationships were re-established and stabilised, and the Czech Republic continues to be Slovakia's most important business partner. After a short interruption, Slovakia's resorts in the Carpathian mountains are again the destination of a growing number of Czech tourists.\n\nFollowing the death of the last Czechoslovak (and the first Czech) president, Václav Havel, on December 18, 2011, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia observed a day of national mourning. During the funeral mass in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral, prayers were recited in an equal ratio in the Czech and the Slovak languages.\n\nSee also\n Hyphen War\n Czech Republic–Slovakia relations\n Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden (another example of a peaceful dissolution)\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n Innes, Abby (2001), Czechoslovakia: The Short Goodbye (New Haven: Yale University Press).\n Rupnik, Jacques (2001), \"Divorce à l’amiable ou guerre de sécession?

Students and young people protested in Prague's Wenceslas Square, singing songs and calling for freedom. The protests were peaceful, and the police did not intervene. The following day, November 18, about 300,000 people gathered in the square. Civic Forum, a new opposition group led by writer-journalist Václav Havel, had called for a general strike after negotiations with the Communist government failed. The strike also received support from the trade union umbrella organization, the Czech Trade Union Association (ČMKOS). The Communist government's inability or unwillingness to put an end to the unrest led to the resignation of the entire party leadership, including the country's leader, Gustáv Husák. A new government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Marián Čalfa. The main task of the new government was to start the process of transforming the economy and preparing the country for free elections. The new government also introduced a number of immediate reforms, including the abolition of the system of universities and the return of private ownership of property. The free elections were held on June 8, 1990. Civic Forum, which won the most votes, and Public Against Violence, which came second, entered into a coalition government with the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-ČSL), which won the third largest number of votes. The new government, headed by Prime Minister Václav Klaus, was sworn in on July 7, 1990. The first free presidential election was held on December 20, 1990. Václav Havel was elected president, and he was sworn in on December 29, 1990. On July 17, 1992, a group of concerned citizens, who felt that the country was being divided into two hostile camps, decided to launch a petition for the re-establishment of a democratic parliament, as they felt that the current parliament had been deformed by the communistic regime. The petition was launched on August 2, 1992, and by the end of the month it had received more than 50,000 signatures. A number of public protests were held in Prague and other cities in the autumn of 1992. The largest of these took place on October 27, when an estimated 500,000 people took part in a demonstration in Prague. The demonstration was organized by the Committee for the Defense of the Democratic Constitution, which was led by a number of well-known public figures, including Jaroslav Šedivý, Pavel Kohout, and Václav Malý. The petition for the re-establishment of a democratic parliament was handed to President Havel on October 28, 1992. The president then asked the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Lubomír Zaorálek, to set up a committee to examine the petition. The committee, which was made up of members of the Chamber of Deputies, met for the first time on November 4, 1992. After lengthy negotiations, a new government was formed on December 16, 1992, under the leadership of Prime Minister Jan Stránský. The new government was sworn in on December 22, 1992. On December 24, 1992, the Chamber of Deputies voted to dissolve the country's borders with Germany and Austria. The vote was preceded by a number of public protests, including a large demonstration in Prague on December 18, 1992, which was attended by an estimated 350,000 people. On December 25, 1992, the Czech Republic and Slovakia officially separated. The president of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel, and the president of Slovakia, Michal Kováč, met in Prague on December 29, 1992, and signed an agreement on the peaceful division of the country. The agreement was approved by the Czech and Slovak parliaments in January 1993. As a result of the division, two new states were created: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic, with its capital in Prague, was a parliamentary republic, while Slovakia, with its capital in Bratislava, was a constitutional republic. The two countries shared a common history, language, and culture, and had a similar economy. On January 1, 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent states. The president of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel, and the president of Slovakia, Michal Kováč, were elected as the heads of state of their respective countries.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 873028}

The term was coined by Japanese writer and researcher Kenji Mikuni. The Haboku sansui legend says that in Japan there exists a map seller who fraudulently sells a map that can never be deciphered by the buyer. The map is said to be sold for a very high price. The story goes that the seller will claim the map is very rare and that it provides the location of a treasure. The buyer will then be given the map, which is often old and dusty, and told that it can be deciphered with a certain method, such as using only the top right corner. However, after the buyer has paid for the map and leaves the shop, they are unable to make sense of the map using the method provided. When the buyer returns to the shop, the seller is nowhere to be found, and the buyer is left with a useless map. It is said that this legend is told as a cautionary tale to warn people of fraudulent sellers. However, the story is also used to convey a deeper meaning about life and how it can be full of uncertainty and confusion. In Japanese culture, it is believed that a person can never truly know the world around them and that there are always hidden truths that can never be discovered.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bengalia\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Bengalia is a genus of blow flies in the family Calliphoridae with one authority considering the genus to belong to a separate family Bengaliidae. These bristly and, unlike the greens and blues of most calliphorids, dull coloured flies, are especially noted for their relationship to ants. Little is known of their biology and life-cycle, although adults of many species are kleptoparasitic on ants and will snatch food and pupae being carried by ants or feed on winged termites.\nThe apt name “Highwayman Fly” was given by an early observer of their way of robbing ants.\nVery little is known about their breeding habits. The genus is found in the Afrotropical and oriental region with one species from Australia possibly a recent introduction.\n\nDescription\nMost of the species have a yellow or brown ground-colour, an antero-posteriorly compressed head, stout mouthparts, a projecting clypeus below the lower facial margin, and have a silent flight.\n\nBehaviour\nBengalia flies are best known for their remarkable highwayman-like habit of robbing ant pupae from ants moving on ant roads.\nWith respect to Bengalia depressa this habit is described as follows: “[The flies were] settling on blades of grass, stones, and other raised objects near the ant column. ... When any ant made a little circuit away from the main body, a fly would generally pursue it at a distance of about half an inch, but back away as soon as the ant turned towards it. ... Eventually Lamborn saw a fly stalk a minor ant carrying a pupa in its jaws. Suddenly the fly rushed forward and apparently pierced the pupa bringing the ant up with a sharp jerk. The two insects then had a tug of war with very little advantage to either side, until the ant apparently became annoyed and letting go of the pupa rushed at the fly, which escaped with the booty which it proceeded to suck. Then he saw a fly swoop down on the ant column and rise at once with a pupa and attendant ant, both of which it dropped after carrying them for about a foot. The ant, however, still held on and started to run off with its charge. The fly caught it again and this time rose three feet in the air and then dropped ant and pupa again. This time the ant left the pupa which the fly immediately seized and proceeded to suck.”\n\nSpecies\n\nBengalia africana Malloch, 1927\nBengalia africanoides Rognes\nBengalia akamanga (Lehrer)\nBengalia aliena Malloch, 1927\nBengalia asymmetria Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia bantuphalla (Lehrer)\nBengalia bezzii Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia calilungae Rueda, 1985\nBengalia chekiangensis Fan\nBengalia chiangmaiensis Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia chromatella Séguy, 1946\nBengalia concava Malloch, 1927\nBengalia cuthbertsoni Zumpt, 1956 \nBengalia depressa Walker, 1858\nBengalia emarginata Malloch\nBengalia emarginatoides Rognes\nBengalia emdeniella (Lehrer)\nBengalia escheri Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia fani Feng & Wei\nBengalia favillacea (Walker)\nBengalia fernandiella Lehrer\nBengalia floccosa Wulp\nBengalia fuscipennis Bezzi, 1913\nBengalia gaillardi Sourcouf & Guyon, 1912 - Synonyms:B. spurca Brauer & Bergenstamm, 1891, B. spurca Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia gigas Macquart\nBengalia hastativentris Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia hobbyi Senior-White, 1940\nBengalia inermis Malloch, 1927\nBengalia jejuna Fabricius\nBengalia kanoi Kurahashi & Magpayo, 2000\nBengalia kuyanianus Matsumura\nBengalia labiata Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830\nBengalia lampunia Lehrer\nBengalia lateralis Macquart\nBengalia latro Meijere\nBengalia lyneborgi James, 1966\nBengalia martinleakei Senior-White, 1930\nBengalia minor Malloch, 1927\nBengalia nirvanella Lehrer\nBengalia pallidicoxa Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia peuhi Villeneuve, 1914\nBengalia pseudovaricolor Kurahashi & Tumrasvin, 1979\nBengalia pygomalaya Lehrer\nBengalia racovitzai (Lehrer)\nBengalia recurva Malloch, 1927\nBengalia robertsi Kurahashi, 1987\nBengalia roubaudi Rickenbach, Hamon & Mochet, 1960\nBengalia semerunia Lehrer\nBengalia seniorwhitei (Lehrer)\nBengalia siamensis Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia smarti (Lehrer)\nBengalia spinifemorata Villeneuve, 1913\nBengalia subnitida James, 1964\nBengalia surcoufi Senior-White, 1923\nBengalia taiwanensis Fan, 1965\nBengalia taksina (Lehrer)\nBengalia tibiaria Villeneuve, 1926\nBengalia torosa Wiedemann\nBengalia unicolor Senior-White, 1946\nBengalia varicolor Fabricius, 1805\nBengalia wangariae (Lehrer)\nBengalia weii Rognes\nBengalia wyatti (Lehrer)\nBengalia xanthopyga Senior-White, 1924\nBengalia zhangi (Lehrer & Wei)\n\nTaxonomic dispute\nThe genus was reclassified into 11 new genera in 4 subfamilies by Andy Lehrer in 2005, within a newly designated family, Bengaliidae. The family designation was disputed by Rognes (2006) who noted that it was equivalent to the already established tribe Bengaliini (now the subfamily Bengaliinae), and that treating it as a family renders the Calliphoridae paraphyletic.  Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work adds 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species are treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.). Additional names published by Lehrer have since been synonymized, with 120 new synonymies established in a single review in 2020.\n\nThis dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states \"The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.\" Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.\n\nReferences\n\nCalliphoridae\nOestroidea genera\nTaxa named by Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy", "machine_text": " Bengalia (Bôngol), also known as Bangala, is a region of West Bengal, India.

Ingraham, as part of a larger expanded system of museums that would record, preserve and historicize the narrative of the independent sovereign nation, established in 1973.\n\nThe NAGB is housed in the historic Villa Doyle (see below) situated on West and West Hill Streets, in Historic Charles Towne and on the border of Delancy Town, and is within easy walking distance of Downtown Nassau’s port and main business quarter. It physically bridges the two districts that are at the core of the nation: bustling Downtown—the hub of colonial power and continued wealth through commerce and tourism—and the ‘Over-the-Hill’ community—also known as the ‘nation’s navel’—where the Majority Rule leaders were born and raised. Sadly, once a thriving middle class community, the latter is now considerably diminished.\n\nThe museum boasts four gallery spaces—the PE, or permanent exhibition space, on the ground floor, which houses rotating shows drawn on the National Collection; The PS Room, a project space for monthly interventions, also on the ground floor; and two temporary exhibition spaces on the second floor (T1 and T2).\n\nThe NAGB is partially funded by a governmental subvention but engages a public-private network to operate and is also supported by the community that it serves, in the form of ticket sales, memberships, donations and otherwise.\n\nThe museum is housed in the Villa Doyle, a mansion built in the 1860s as the home to first Chief Justice in The Bahamas. After the addition of a new wing in the 1920s, it became one of Nassau’s prized stately homes. Positioned on the rise overlooking the top of West Street, Villa Doyle is typical of great houses of earlier centuries with surrounding verandahs.\n\nLeft to wrack and ruin in the modern age, many argued for its demolition to obliterate the reminder of our colonial past.

They finished the season 3–9, 2–6 in Mountain West play to finish in a tie for fifth place in the West Division. Hawaii was not invited to any bowl game for the first time since 2007. On September 24, Hawaii beat the then-No. 18 Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium, 24–21, giving the Rainbow Warriors their first win over a ranked team since beating then-No. 25 Boise State in the 2010 Hawaii Bowl, and their first road win over a Top 25 team since defeating then-No. 20 Arizona State in 2007. The win was the Rainbow Warriors' first win in Madison since the 1953 season, when Hawaii beat Wisconsin 20–7. On November 4, Hawaii beat San Diego State, 27–24, in a game that was originally scheduled to be played in San Diego but was moved to Honolulu due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The game was the first time since November 15, 1975, that Hawaii and San Diego State faced each other in Honolulu. The 1975 game was also moved to Honolulu due to a disaster, specifically the Great Alaska earthquake, which forced the game to be moved from San Diego to Honolulu. The two teams played to a 7–7 tie in the 1975 game. On November 11, Hawaii beat UNLV, 41–38, in the first meeting between the two teams since 2012. Hawaii had beaten UNLV, 38–35, in 2012. On November 18, Hawaii lost to Wyoming, 59–56, in a game that featured nine combined turnovers, including seven interceptions. The 56 points were the most points Hawaii had scored in a loss since losing to Boise State, 56–55, in 2007. On November 25, Hawaii lost to San Jose State, 21–16, in a game that was played on Thanksgiving night. Hawaii had a 16–13 lead with 5:08 remaining in the fourth quarter, but San Jose State drove for a touchdown on their ensuing possession to take a 21–16 lead. Hawaii was unable to score on their final possession, and turned the ball over on downs. The loss was Hawaii's first to San Jose State since 2006, and the first time Hawaii had lost to San Jose State since becoming a member of the Mountain West Conference. On December 2, Hawaii lost to Boise State, 28–21, in the 2017 Mountain West Championship Game. Hawaii had a 21–20 lead with 1:17 remaining in the fourth quarter, but Boise State responded with a touchdown on their ensuing possession to take a 28–21 lead. Hawaii was unable to score on their final possession, and turned the ball over on downs. The loss was Hawaii's third straight loss to Boise State, and the third time in four years that Hawaii had lost to Boise State in the Mountain West Championship Game.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nokia Lumia 2520\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Nokia Lumia 2520 is a Windows RT tablet computer originally developed by Nokia. It is Nokia's first and only Windows-based tablet, and the company's first tablet since its Nokia Internet Tablet line. Sharing its design and marketed with the Nokia Lumia series of Windows Phone products, the device incorporates a quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip with 4G LTE support, along with a 10.1-inch (26 cm) 1080p display and an optional \"Power Keyboard\" dock adding additional battery capacity, USB ports, and a physical hardware keyboard. Following a period of speculation and leaks, the Lumia 2520 was officially unveiled on 22 October 2013, and released in North America on 21 November 2013.\n\nThe 2520 was met with mostly positive reviews, praising its design, display, and for being the first Windows RT tablet to offer cellular data (although Microsoft's own Surface 2 was soon available with such an option). However, the device also received criticism for the lack of available software for its operating system (due to the inability of Windows RT to run full Windows desktop programs), along with the design of its keyboard dock.\n\nFrom April 2014 it was maintained and sold by Microsoft Mobile. The Nokia Lumia 2520 was discontinued by Microsoft on February 2, 2015, being the last Windows RT device, coming a month after the production halt of the Surface 2.\n\nAfter Nokia's phone business was sold to Microsoft, Nokia started making the Nokia N1. The Nokia N1 ultimately succeeded Nokia's former Lumia 2520.\n\nIn September 2017, HMD global gained rights for design patent of Lumia 2520.\n\nDevelopment and release \nIn mid-August 2013, details began leaking surrounding a Windows RT tablet being produced by Nokia codenamed \"Sirius\", which featured a 10.1-inch (26 cm) screen, LTE support and a design similar to Nokia's Lumia series of Windows Phone devices. A press render leaked in October 2013, along with its branding as the \"Lumia 2520\". The Lumia 2520 was officially unveiled during a Nokia press event on 22 October 2013 at a Nokia World event in Abu Dhabi, where it also unveiled Lumia 1320 and 1520 running Windows Phone 8. The device marks Nokia's first Microsoft Windows-based tablet device, and its first tablet product since its Internet Tablet range.\n\nThe Lumia 2520 was first released in the United States by Verizon Wireless on November 21, 2013. In the U.S., carrier-branded versions were released by Verizon and AT&T. The Verizon Wireless model differs only in its use of different LTE bands, and a lack of support for GSM networks, unlike the international and AT&T version. No Wi-Fi-only version of the Lumia 2520 was released.\n\nIn April 2014, Nokia recalled the AC-300 travel charger for the Lumia 2520 after it was discovered that the cover on its plug could separate and expose internal parts, posing an electric shock hazard when in use. While sold as an accessory in the United States, it was bundled with European models; as a result, Nokia also suspended sales of the Lumia 2520 in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nHardware \nThe Lumia 2520 uses a quad-core, 2.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 system-on-chip with 2 GB of RAM and support for LTE networks, and has either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 64 GB with a MicroSD card. Its display is a 10.1-inch (26 cm), 1080p IPS panel with Nokia's \"ClearBlack\" technology, coated with Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The Lumia 2520 also includes an 8000 mAh battery rated for 10 hours of use, a 6.7-megapixel rear-facing camera identical to that of the Lumia 720, micro HDMI and USB 3.0 ports, and a proprietary dock connector. The Lumia 2520's hardware design uses a similar polycarbonate-based style to Nokia's line of Lumia smartphones, available in either red, cyan, black, or white finishes. An optional keyboard dock accessory known as the \"Power Keyboard\" adds a keyboard, kickstand, two full-sized USB ports and a supplemental battery, rated for 5 hours of additional use.\n\nSoftware \nAs the Lumia 2520 uses the ARM architecture rather than x86, it runs the Windows RT 8.1 operating system. It can only run Windows Store apps and, like all Windows RT products, is pre-loaded with Microsoft Office RT. In common with all Lumia products, it comes with a suite of exclusive Nokia-provided apps, such as a customized Nokia Camera app, Here Maps, MixRadio, Storyteller, and Video Director. A unique augmented reality game, DreamWorks Dragons Adventure, is also included.\n\nReception \nThe Lumia 2520 was released to positive reviews; early reviews praised the tablet for its display and design, and praised its performance for showing a notable improvement over early Windows RT devices such as the first-generation Surface.\n\nEngadget gave the Lumia 2520 a 79 out of 100, considering it to be a \"strong\" entry into the Windows tablet market, but criticizing the limitations of Windows RT and the poor Windows Store app selection, the fact that there was no Wi-Fi-only model, the keyboard dock's key layout being too \"cramped\", and the dock's kickstand was criticized for echoing the design of the original Microsoft Surface, which was poor for \"in-lap\" use because it only had one angle. However, the Lumia 2520 was praised for having a light build, and a relatively better camera than other tablets (but criticizing the quality of its video recording, describing it as an afterthought). The battery life of the device was noted for being even longer than Nokia claimed, reaching 13 and a half hours of video playback with Wi-Fi enabled and the display on 50% brightness. The Verge believed that the Lumia 2520 had better performance than the Microsoft Surface 2, and was more \"portable\" due to its LTE support, but criticized the keyboard dock for being too heavy, and shared concerns surrounding the application selection for Windows Store.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nLumia 2520\nWindows Phone devices\nMicrosoft Lumia\nTablet computers introduced in 2013\nTablet computers\nTouchscreen portable media players", "machine_text": " The Nokia Lumia 2520 was a 10.4-inch (270 mm) tablet manufactured by Nokia, running the Windows RT operating system.

Michael Seyfert (November 21, 1929 – February 13, 2017) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He played for the University of Michigan football team from 1950 to 1952, and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference center in 1951. He was the head football coach at the University of Miami from 1970 to 1980, where he compiled a 61–26 record, won five bowl games, and produced two consensus All-Americans. He also served as Miami's athletic director from 1976 to 1986. Seyfert was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1929. He grew up in Royal Oak, Michigan and attended Royal Oak High School. Seyfert enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1948 and played for the Michigan football team from 1950 to 1952. As a sophomore in 1950, he started all nine games at right guard for the Wolverines. The following year, he moved to center and started all eight games, helping the team to a 7–1 record and a No. 6 ranking in the final AP poll. As a senior in 1952, he started all nine games at center and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference center. In three years as a starter, Michigan never ranked lower than No. 6 in the AP poll. The Wolverines were Big Ten champions and ranked No. 3 in the final AP poll in 1950, and they were Big Ten co-champions and ranked No. 6 in the final AP poll in 1951. Seyfert was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 1953 NFL Draft, but he chose instead to remain at Michigan as an assistant coach. He began his coaching career as the freshman coach at Michigan in 1953. He was promoted to offensive line coach in 1955, a position he held for 11 years. During that time, the Wolverines won Big Ten titles in 1964 and 1965 and produced three All-American offensive linemen: Ed Budde in 1955, Tom Mack in 1956, and John Houtman in 1966.

The group was formed by three British musicians (Michael Chant, Steve Beresford, and John Zorn) and three French musicians (Christian Clozier, Robert Aichinger, and Daniel Teruggi) with the addition of the Belgian Gunter Sommer. The group's music was an attempt to bridge the gap between free jazz and free improvisation, two traditions which had previously been worlds apart. The musicians sought to combine the powerful, structured, and directed sound of free jazz with the more open-ended and spontaneous approach of free improvisation. To achieve this, the group used a unique rehearsal method, in which the musicians would sit in a circle and play together for hours at a time, without any pre-written music or conduction. This approach allowed the musicians to develop a strong group dynamic and a collective, organic sound. The group's music was characterized by its use of drones, noise, and repetitive patterns, and by its playful and intuitive approach to composition and structure. The group's first album, 4 (Ensemble) Compositions, was released in 1992, and featured four extended compositions, each of which was named after the four elements. The album was recorded live at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle in Paris, and was released on the Italian Black Saint label. 4 (Ensemble) Compositions was well received by critics, and was praised for its unique approach to composition and its powerful, organic sound. The album was also noted for its strong emotional and spiritual content, which was seen as a refreshing change from the more cerebral and abstract approach of many free jazz and free improvisation groups.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 31928127}

At one time, nearly the entire neighborhood was filled with market stalls and in the 1860s it was decided to build a permanent market on the grounds of the old La Merced monastery. In the first half of the 20th century, this market was the major wholesaler for the entire city. This ended when the Central de Abasto was opened in the 1980s, but La Merced remains the largest traditional retail market. The market area is also known for flagrant prostitution in which women can be seen soliciting at all hours of the day and night. It is estimated that about one third of these prostitutes are underage.\n\nLocation\nLa Merced is located east of the main plaza or Zocalo in several very large buildings, and is the city's largest traditional retail market. Metro La Merced has openings both just outside the market and inside one of the buildings. Outside the buildings, the unofficial market or “tianguis” continues on the sidewalks and streets between this market and the Zocalo. This kind of commerce is illegal, but laws against it are only intermittently enforced as unemployment is high, and peddlers pay bribes to local bosses who in turn pay bribes to local officials. This means that both inside and outside the market, pedestrian traffic jams are frequent, making pushing and shoving necessary and socially acceptable. The market area also generates about 450 tons of trash daily.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name La Merced is synonymous with commerce in the city. The market and neighborhood is located on the far eastern side of the original layout of Mexico City after the Conquest. Here many traders arrived with wares from near and far. The market is named after the neighborhood, La Merced, which in turn was named after the monastery Nuestra Señora de la Merced de Redención de Cautivos established in 1594 and simply called the monastery of La Merced. Most of this monastery has since disappeared, leaving only its cloister with its Plateresque decoration. The neighborhood is an old one, and stories and legends, such as the whispers of Doña Esperanza Goyeneche de Ruiz Garcia who died here. Another involves an indigenous chief who received money for being a spy for the Spaniards and was found out. It is said that when this happened, he sat still never moving until he died of sadness.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, almost the entire neighborhood was one great market, which became bigger when the markets of the Zocalo area were banished around the same time. In the 19th century, the famous Circo Orrín with the first Mexican clown Ricardo Bell of Pachuca regularly stopped near this market.\n\nIn the 1860s, it was decided to put the market under a roof, and the buildings were constructed on the old monastery grounds. In 1863, the first permanent buildings were constructed. By the early 20th century La Merced was the major wholesale and retail market of Mexico City, especially for foodstuffs. It continued to be the wholesale market for the city during the post-Mexican Revolution period until about the 1960s. At that time, the Central de Abasto market was created in the south of the city to take over and modernize the wholesaling of foodstuffs, especially produce and meat. La Merced continues to be the largest retail traditional market of Mexico City for a wide variety of everyday products such as fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, toys, clothes; flowers, candy and more.\n\nIn 1988, a fireworks stand in La Merced exploded, which killed more than 60 people. In 1998, a major fire destroyed two-thirds of the main hall of the market, along with 572 stalls selling dried chili peppers, fruit, vegetables, shoes and piñatas in the early morning hours of 4 May. No one was killed or injured and the cause was suspected to be faulty wiring. It took over 100 firemen more than three hours to get the fire under control.\n\nInside the market\n\nThe largest building of the complex is dedicated mostly to the sale of fruits and vegetables. Other buildings sell household items such as juicers, tinware, spoons, cleaning supplies and much more. There is constant movement of people here, with many shouting out to potential customers. Work begins here in the very early morning hours and ends in the evening. The market is filled at all hours with truck drivers, sellers, buyers, butchers and cooks.\n\nBasic Mexican foodstuffs is the backbone of this markets selling Mexican spices such as epazote, chili peppers fresh and dried of just about every variety, nopals (cactus pads),  pig skins fried whole, corn, and uncommon items such as wild mushrooms including a variety that look like chantrelle but denser. One of the few places to find truly authentic Oaxaca cheese in the city.  Vendors can be seen tying stacks of banana leaves, cutting spines from nopals, and selling “secret” herbal remedies.\n\nLa Merced, like most Mexican traditional markets, is a favored place to eat Mexican street food, called “antojitos” (lit. cravings). Two specialties here are quesadillas and tostadas. Quesadillas can be had with a variety of fillings along with the cheese (typically Oaxaca cheese) such as stewed pork stomach, pickled pork fat, huitlacoche (corn fungus) and squash flowers. The quesadillas sold here are typically long and cooked on a comal, often from blue corn dough. It is topped with red or green chili peppers that have been blended with onions and salt into a watery paste. Like the quesadillas, tostadas have a wide variety of toppings and the crunchy tortilla sometimes has unusual flavorings such as sesame seeds and chipotle.\n\nProstitution\nMerced is considered to be a “tolerance zone” for prostitution, meaning that police generally do not intervene.  Prostitution exists in just about all parts of Mexico City but it is most obvious here. At almost any hour of the day, scantily clad women can be seen walking around. Many of these prostitutes are underage. Prices can be as low as US$15 for an “encuentro” (encounter). Many small hotels are near here, some of which charge as little as 30 pesos for an hour or about 200 for a night. Many of the customers are truck drivers who have time while their vehicles are being unloaded at the market. In 2007-2008 several prostitutes were murdered. Nearly all of the murders have gone unpunished. It is estimated about one third of prostitutes here are underage. Bribes to officials to keep the industry running are estimated to be about US$450,000 a year.\n\nReferences\n\nRetail markets in Mexico City\nCuauhtémoc, Mexico City\nRed-light districts in Mexico\nHistoric center of Mexico City", "machine_text": " La Merced Market (Spanish: Mercado de La Merced) is a traditional indoor market in Mexico City, located in the Merced neighborhood of the Cuauhtémoc borough, just north of the Historic Center.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Schnellbomber\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Schnellbomber (German; literally \"fast bomber\") is a bomber that relies upon speed to avoid enemy fighters, rather than relying on defensive armament and armor.\n\nConcept\nThe concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance.\n\nAdolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the Schnellbomber and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the Schnellbomber, lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and its heavier twin-engine Bf 110 counterpart due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first aircraft adopted for the Schnellbomber role was the single-engine Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engine Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability.\n\nBomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the Schnellbomber, and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940.\n\nJapan's air war in China\nAs World War II broke out in Asia with the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Navy dispatched dozens of their unescorted Mitsubishi G3M bombers in the schnellbomber strategy of Giulio Douhet's total war concept of attacks against Chinese Air Force assets as well as civilian targets, however, the strategy backfired as the Japanese underestimated the effectiveness of the Chinese air raid early-warning net and the numbers of experienced Chinese pilots leading their squadrons of Curtiss Hawk III (max-speed marginally slower than G3M) and Boeing P-26 Model 281 (max-speed marginally faster than G3M) fighters in a bloody rout against the Japanese bombers. Nonetheless, the total war strategy with the schnellbomber wasn't lost to the Japanese, as the Chinese lost many of their top fighter pilots by Fall of Nanking at the end of 1937, and with ever-growing Japanese blockade of war materials and high-octane aviation fuel particularly following the capture of Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, the increasing obsolescence of Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel versus fast and high-flying massed bomber formations burning high-octane avgas continued to wreak havoc and devastation against Chinese cities for years to come, particularly in the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu beginning in May 1939; eventually however, the United States enacted an oil and steel embargo against Japan in July 1941.\n\nGermany's quest for \"fast bombers\"\nThe Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer Schnellbombers, as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as Schnellbombers by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 Blitz (dubbed \"the fastest bomber\" – \"Schnellstbomber\").\n\nSeveral other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 — meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start — as a new Zerstörer heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765 km/h (475 mph).  The Bomber B high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original Schnellbomber role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier Schnellbomber designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the Bomber B program.\n\nde Havilland Mosquito\nThe most successful Schnellbomber of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own Schnellbomber concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all-wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name Moskito.\n\nSee also\nBomber B - 1939 design competition, meant to replace all bombers in Luftwaffe service\nFighter-bomber\nLight bomber\n\nReferences\n\nBomber aircraft\nLuftwaffe", "machine_text": " Schnellbomber Schnellbomber, German: schnell meaning \"fast\" and bomber meaning \"bomber\", is a generic term for a fast light bomber. The term was first used in the 1930s to describe the Messerschmitt Bf 109B, a fighter-bomber version of the Bf 109 air superiority fighter. During the war, the term was also used for the Fiesler Storchsäge der Storch (Storch's spade) light ground-attack aircraft, and the Focke-Wulf Fw 189C, a light reconnaissance-bomber version of the Fw 189C reconnaissance aircraft. During the early 1930s, the German Luftwaffe did not have a defined light bomber force. The light bomber role was initially filled by the twin-engine Bf 110, which was developed from the Bf 108 transport aircraft, and the single-engine Bf 109, which was developed from the Bf 108 and Bf 206 fighter aircraft. In the early 1930s, the Bf 110 was considered underpowered and underarmed for its role, and in 1935 the Bf 110 was replaced in this role by the Ju 88. The Bf 109B, which had a maximum speed of only 61 mph (98 km/h) and was armed with only two 20 mm MG FF cannon and two 7.92 mm (0.31 in) MG 17 machine guns, was considered too lightly armed for ground attack missions, and in the late 1930s it was replaced in this role by the Hs 129B. Although the Bf 109B was underpowered and underarmed for its role, it was one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft of World War II, and it was capable of escorting the Ju 87 Stuka, a much slower dive-bomber, on its missions. In 1940, the Luftwaffe began replacing the Ju 87Stuka with the Fw 190, a much faster fighter-bomber. The Fw 190 was faster than the Bf 109B and it was also more heavily armed, but it was not as fast as the Bf 109B, and it was not capable of escorting the Ju 87 Stuka on its missions.

With an elevation of 2,729 metres (8,957 ft), Golyam Rezen is the highest peak in the western part of the Balkans and the third highest in Bulgaria, after Musala (2, 925 m, the highest peak) and Botev (2, 752 m). The peak is located on the main ridge of the Balkan Mountains, which runs west to east from the border with Serbia to the town of Varna on the Black Sea coast. Golyam Rezen is situated on the border between the counties of Berkovitsa and Varshets. The nearest town is Berkovitsa, at a distance of about 20 kilometres (12 mi), and the nearest villages are Mramor, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) away, and Teshovo, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away. Golyam Rezen is a popular tourist destination for hiking, trekking, alpinism and skiing. There are two main routes for climbing the peak, both of which start from the village of Mramor. The first route, which is more difficult, starts from the end of the village and follows the ridge to the peak; the second route, which is easier and more frequently used, starts from the centre of the village and follows the valley to the west of the peak. Both routes join at the final section of the climb, just below the peak. The climb is generally considered easy for an experienced alpinist, but the weather can be unpredictable and the wind strong. The peak and the surrounding area are part of the Balkan Nature Park, the largest nature park in Bulgaria, which is home to many plant and animal species, some of which are endemic. There are three nature reserves in the vicinity of the peak: \"Golyam Rezen\", \"Mechkare\" and \"Shiroka Polyana\". The area is also rich in mineral resources, including gold and silver. The first known attempts to climb Golyam Rezen were made in 1871 and 1872, but the peak was not conquered until 9 September 1895, when it was climbed by the Swiss alpinists Felix Imholtz and Franz Nicholl, together with the Bulgarian || Dimitar Ilievski-Pavaruh.

When the chromatrope is rotated, the holes or slits allow the user to view a continuously moving spectrum of colors. The speed of the moving spectrum can be controlled by adjusting the speed of the rotation. The chromatrope can be used as a scientific instrument to study the properties of light, or as a decorative item. It is often used as a demonstration tool in physics classrooms to show the separation of light into its constituent colors.

He taught clarinet as a professor at the Gnessin State Musical College. For his participation as a soldier in World War II and for his later artistic achievements, he received numerous medals and honorary titles, including the title People's Artist of Russia.\n\nBiography \nMozgovenko was born on 13 February 1924 in Yashalta, Stepnovsky District, Rostov Region, Russian SFSR, USSR (now the Republic of Kalmykia in the Russian Federation). In 1931, his family's property was expropriated and the family was exiled to the Ural region in the area of Nizhny Tagil. From 1939 to 1943, he studied at the Tchaikovsky Music College in Sverdlovsk in the clarinet class. In 1943, he joined the Ural Volunteer Tank Corps, where he served in the medical battalion, fighting from Oryol, Bryansk and Zhitomir to Berlin and Prague. He was offered a commission as his unit demobilized, but continued his musical studies instead.\n\nIn 1946, he continued his training as a clarinetist at the Gnessin State Musical College, where he studied with Alexander Leonidovich Shtark (or Stark) (first degree in 1951, the graduate school in 1954). In 1951 he won the first prize at an international competition in Berlin and since worked as a soloist and chamber musician. He played with the Borodin Quartet. From 1953 to 1968, Mozgovenko was principal clarinetist with the State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. In collaboration with the Borodin Quartet and other chamber ensembles, Mozgovenko recorded works by Mozart, Brahms, Prokofiev and some contemporary composers. In addition to his concert activities, Mozgovenko taught at the Gnessin State Musical College since 1951, and as an associate professor since 1966. In 1980 he was awarded the title of professor. His students include many clarinetists and award winners of international competitions. Mozgovenko is also the author of a number of textbooks and transcriptions for clarinet.\n\nMozgovenko performed with Russian quartets like the Prokofiev, Beethoven, Komitas and Glinka quartets, and with musicians like Svyatoslav Richter, Sergei Prokofiev, Maria Yudina, Van Cliburn and Mstislav Rostropovich.\n\nHe collaborated with notable conductors like Yevgeny Svetlanov, Kirill Kondrashin, Alexander Gauk, Leonard Bernstein, Yuri Temirkanov, Vladimir Fedoseyev and Gennady Rozhdestvensky. He trained many musicians, becoming a founder of the Russian clarinet school.\n\nMozgovenko died on 31 December 2021, at the age of 97.\n\nInstruments \n\nWhen Mosgowenko began to play the clarinet, the German fingering system for the clarinet dominated in the USSR. In the early 1960s, there was a general changeover to the Boehm system (including the Reform Boehm system, which came closer to the German sound, until the 1980s), which Mozgovenko was unable to avoid. In 1964, he also changed and has been playing Buffet Crampon instruments for many years.\n\nSignificance \nIn Russia, Mozgovenko was considered the father of the current generation of clarinetists. , fourteen full or associate professors and 50 prize winners were his students.\nMozgovenko said:\n\"I am glad that my students are working all over the world – in the USA, Canada and France. I have celebrated 70 years of teaching at the academy.\"\n\nIn a tribute to his 95th birthday it is reported that he saw himself as the \"creative grandson\" of the founder of the Russian clarinet school Sergej Sobnow, whom he regarded as the successor to the founder of the clarinet school in Germany Carl Baermann.\n\nOn his 90th birthday he performed again. Beginning on the occasion of his 95th birthday, an international clarinet competition named after Mozgovenko has been taking place in Russia since 2019.\n\nFor Margarita Konstantinovna, one of his former students, Mozgovenko is an icon of Russian and world-spiritual art, who has made a great contribution to its development, with its own school, its own technique and many students.\n\nRecordings \nMosgowenko has made a number of vinyl recordings since 1951.

In 1838, he published a translation of the works of Archimedes. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Royal Irish Academy. In 1835, Braham published an article in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, in which he proposed a new method of solving spherical right-angles triangles, which he called the \"Brahmian method\", or the \"direct method\". This method was implemented by RobertWitness in 1838 and was later generalized by James Inman in 1854. The Brahmian method is sometimes called the \"Braham- WITNESS method\" or the \"Braham-Inman method\" in the literature. Braham was a friend of Charles Babbage and was involved with the development of his proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. He was the author of an article on the engine, and a lifelong correspondent of Babbage on the topic. Braham was a member of the Royal Society's \"Committee for the Investigation of Magnetism\", which was charged with investigating the galvanic and magnetic phenomena associated with the Earth's magnetic field. In the 1850s, he published several papers on the topic of terrestrial magnetism, and also published a paper on the mathematics of railway projectors. In 1865, Braham published a paper in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, in which he proposed a method for the calculation of the magnetic elements of a curved line, which he called the \"direct method\".

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frank McDonough\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frank McDonough is a British historian of the Third Reich and international history.\n\nLife\n\nFrancis [Frank] Xavier McDonough was born on 17 April 1957 in Liverpool. He read modern History at Balliol College, Oxford, as a Senior Status Scholar. He was at Balliol at the same time as Boris Johnson and knew him. He later earned a PhD in history from Lancaster University, under the supervision of Ruth Henig. He was Professor of International History in the History Department of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Liverpool John Moores University until his retirement in 2021. He is an avid Liverpool F.C. fan and still lives in Liverpool with his partner Ann.\n\nWork\nHis key area of research is international history, particularly Anglo-German relations in the 20th century. He has published significant works on the origins of World War I and World War II. McDonough is increasingly publishing his research on the Third Reich, including opposition to Hitler, the Holocaust and the Gestapo.\n\nNeville Chamberlain and appeasement\n\nIn his study of Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, published in 1998, McDonough outlined a 'post revisionist' theory, which built on the work of R. A. C. Parker's 1994 book Chamberlain and Appeasement, by expanding it to include appeasement in society and looking at economic appeasement, the mass media and the opponents of appeasement. McDonough accepted that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but unlike the revisionists he argued that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. He suggested that appeasement must be analysed as a usable policy at the time it operated and focus on how Chamberlain's personality played a crucial role in the conduct of the policy, in particular, his errors of judgement, his failure to listen to opponents and his unwillingness to try any alternatives. McDonough argues that Chamberlain's version of appeasement, as operated by such an inflexible politician, unwilling to change direction, until events forced him to, actually contributed to Britain and France entering the war in 1939 in a much weaker strategic position, and passed the early advantage in the war to Hitler's regime, which meant that Germany only faced one European front until June 1944.\n\nThe study was reviewed in academic journals. Parker described it as \"very well written, with a lively argument, which explores appeasement in society too\". Andrew Thorpe, a leading authority on foreign affairs, described the book as \"a cogent and stimulating analysis of appeasement which will take the debate still deeper\". A leading US historian of foreign affairs from the Reed College, Edward B. Segel, commented: \"The book brings out effectively how the British government manipulated the mass-media, the press and especially the BBC to exclude public criticism of Chamberlain's policies and convey the impression of overwhelming support\".\n\nMcDonough is one of the most prominent 'post-revisionist' experts on Neville Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement, along with Parker, who was, as Sydney Aster points out, his \"academic mentor while he was at Oxford\".\n\nOther books\n\nIn McDonough's 2007 monograph, The Conservative Party and Anglo-German Relations, 1905–1914, published by Palgrave Macmillan, he moved the focus of analysis to the Conservative Party's role in the outbreak of the First World War. The study was described in a review in the journal The Bulletin of the German Institute of Historical Research by a German foreign policy scholar as \"a thorough and thought-provoking analysis, which draws on over thirty archives and provides a powerful and overdue corrective to the traditional depiction of the Edwardian Conservative Party as 'Scaremongers' and the chief promoters of Germanophobic views among British political parties in the years that led to the outbreak of the First World War\".\n\nIn addition, to his research on Anglo-German relations, McDonough has written a number of publications on the related subject of the history of the Third Reich, most notably, Hitler and Nazi Germany (1999); Opposition and Resistance in Nazi Germany (2001); and Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party (2003).\n\nAmong his other books are: The Origins of the First and Second World Wars (1997); The British Empire, 1815–1914 (1994); and Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement (2002). In 1998, McDonough was commissioned by the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations Board to write a set text entitled Fascism, Conflict and Communism: European History: 1890–1945.\n\nIn recent years, McDonough's published work has been focused on aspects of the history of the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2008, McDonough published The Holocaust, with John Cochrane. This book is a new introduction to both the events and the complex international response to the Holocaust and examines the grim reality of life and death in the death camps, the scholarly debates and the impact on popular culture since 1945 of the most horrific aspect of the history of the 20th century.\n\nMcDonough is the author of an English-language biography of the German resistance heroine, Sophie Scholl, entitled Sophie Scholl: The Woman Who Defied Hitler, published by the History Press in February 2009.\n\nIn September 2011, McDonough published The Origins of the Second World War: An international Perspective, about the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn April 2012, the second edition of \"Hitler and the Rise of the Nazi Party\" was published.\n\nIn August 2015, McDonough's study The Gestapo: The Myth and Reality of Hitler's Secret Police was published by the Hodder and Stoughton imprint Coronet. The book is based on original Gestapo files and tells the story of the victims of Nazi Terror. The book has been published in translated versions in Italy (March 2016), Spain (June 2016), Norway (August 2016), Sweden (September 2016), Finland (2016) and Romania (2019).\n\nThe paperback version of the Gestapo book was released in September 2016 \n\nMcDonough has most recently completed a two volume book titled 'The Hitler Years'. The first volume (Triumph 1933–1939) is due to be published on 14 November 2019.\n\nMedia appearances and Twitter\nMcDonough has also appeared on TV and radio. He appeared on CrossTalk on Russia Today in 2010, debating whether the Second World War could have been prevented. He featured in the BBC 1 documentary A Tale of Two Rival Cities, which was part of the BBC's \"History of the World\" project, for which he also acted as Historical Consultant; the documentary won a Royal Television Society Award. He was interviewed in two special programmes on French National Television to mark the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's 18 June 1940 speech when he said the \"flame of French Resistance cannot be extinguished\". McDonough appeared as an historical commentator on France 2 and in a special documentary featuring historians on de Gaulle, broadcast on France 3 on 18 June 2010. He also appeared in the BBC 1 programme Inside Out commenting on a story presented by the actor Paul McGann that looked at whether or not Adolf Hitler visited Liverpool between November 1911 and May 1912. McDonough argued that evidence from Austrian police records, eyewitness accounts from Vienna, and shipping records all strongly indicated that the young Hitler had lived in Vienna at this time, not Liverpool, thus confirming what Hitler claimed in his autobiography, Mein Kampf.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Paris meridian\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Paris meridian is a meridian line running through the Paris Observatory in Paris, France – now longitude 2°20′14.02500″ East. It was a long-standing rival to the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian of the world. The \"Paris meridian arc\" or \"French meridian arc\" (French: la Méridienne de France) is the name of the meridian arc measured along the Paris meridian. \n\nThe French meridian arc was important for French cartography, inasmuch as the triangulations of France began with the measurement of the French meridian arc. Moreover, the French meridian arc was important for geodesy as it was one of the meridian arcs which were measured in order to determine the figure of the Earth via the arc measurement method. The determination of the figure of the Earth was a problem of the highest importance in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the Earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.\n\nHistory\n\nFrench cartography and the figure of the Earth \n\nIn the year 1634, France ruled by Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, decided that the Ferro meridian should be used as the reference on maps, since El Hierro (Ferro) was the most western position of the Ptolemy's world map. It was also thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of Paris. The astronomers of the French Academy of Sciences, founded in 1666, managed to clarify the position of El Hierro relative to the meridian of Paris, which gradually supplanted the Ferro meridian. In 1666, Louis XIV of France had authorized the building of the Paris Observatory. On Midsummer's Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building's outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north–south. French cartographers would use it as their prime meridian for more than 200 years. Old maps from continental Europe often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom.\n\nA French astronomer, Abbé Jean Picard, measured the length of a degree of latitude along the Paris meridian (arc measurement) and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1668–1670. The application of the telescope to angular instruments was an important step. He was the first who in 1669, with the telescope, using such precautions as the nature of the operation requires, measured a precise arc of meridian (Picard's arc measurement). He measured with wooden rods a baseline of 5,663 toises, and a second or base of verification of 3,902 toises; his triangulation network extended from Malvoisine, near Paris, to Sourdon, near Amiens. The angles of the triangles were measured with a quadrant furnished with a telescope having cross-wires. The difference of latitude of the terminal stations was determined by observations made with a sector on a star in Cassiopeia, giving 1° 22′ 55″ for the amplitude. The terrestrial degree measurement gave the length of 57,060 toises, whence he inferred 6,538,594 toises for the Earth's diameter.\n\nFour generations of the Cassini family headed the Paris Observatory. They directed the surveys of France for over 100 years. Hitherto geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the magnitude of the Earth considered as a sphere, but a discovery made by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form. This astronomer, having been sent by the Academy of Sciences of Paris to the island of Cayenne (now in French Guiana) in South America, for the purpose of investigating the amount of astronomical refraction and other astronomical objects, observed that his clock, which had been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes and a half daily at Cayenne, and that in order to bring it to measure mean solar time it was necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line (about 1⁄12th of an in.). This fact, which was scarcely credited till it had been confirmed by the subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes on the coasts of Africa and America, was first explained in the third book of Newton’s Principia, who showed that it could only be referred to a diminution of gravity arising either from a protuberance of the equatorial parts of the Earth and consequent increase of the distance from the centre, or from the counteracting effect of the centrifugal force. About the same time (1673) appeared Christiaan Huygens’ De Horologio Oscillatorio, in which for the first time were found correct notions on the subject of centrifugal force. It does not, however, appear that they were applied to the theoretical investigation of the figure of the Earth before the publication of Newton's Principia. In 1690 Huygens published his De Causa Gravitatis, which contains an investigation of the figure of the Earth on the supposition that the attraction of every particle is towards the centre. \n\nBetween 1684 and 1718 Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Jacques Cassini, along with Philippe de La Hire, carried a triangulation, starting from Picard's base in Paris and extending it northwards to Dunkirk and southwards to Collioure. They measured a base of 7,246 toises near Perpignan, and a somewhat shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had an amplitude of 2° 12′ 9″, obtained 56,960 toises for the length of a degree; while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6° 18′ 57″, they obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, with the degree diminishing with increasing latitude, the Earth must be a prolate spheroid. This conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of Newton and Huygens, and accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other — one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a high latitude. Thus arose the celebrated , to the Equator and to Lapland, the latter directed by Pierre Louis Maupertuis.\n\nIn 1740 an account was published in the Paris Mémoires, by Cassini de Thury, of a remeasurement by himself and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille of the meridian of Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five stations. The results previously obtained by Giovanni Domenico and Jacques Cassini were not confirmed, but, on the contrary, the length of the degree derived from these partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with increasing latitude.\n\nThe West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc \nCesar-François Cassini de Thury completed the Cassini map, which was published by his son Cassini IV in 1790. Moreover, the Paris meridian was linked with international collaboration in geodesy and metrology. Cesar-François Cassini de Thury (1714-1784) expressed the project to extend the French geodetic network all around the world and to connect the Paris and Greenwich observatories. In 1783 the French Academy of Science presented his proposal to King George III. This connection and a proposal from General William Roy led to the first triangulation of Great Britain. France and Great Britain surveys' connection was repeated by French astronomers and geodesists in 1787 by Cassini IV, in 1823-1825 by François Arago and in 1861-1862 by François Perrier.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1798 Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre surveyed the Paris meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona (see meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain). They extrapolated from this measurement the distance from the North Pole to the Equator which was 5 130 740 toises. As the metre had to be equal to one ten-millionth of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,296 lignes of the Toise of Peru (see below) and of the double-toise N° 1 of the apparatus which had been devised by Lavoisier and Borda for this survey at specified temperatures.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Paris meridian's arc was recalculated with greater precision between Shetland and the Balearic Islands by the astronomer François Arago, whose name now appears on the plaques or medallions tracing the route of the meridian through Paris (see below). Biot and Arago published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of \"Bases du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l'arc méridien compris entre les parallèles de Dunkerque et Barcelone\" (Basis for the decimal metric system or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona) by Delambre and Méchain.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero directed the survey of Spain. From 1870 to 1894 the Paris meridan's arc was remeasured by Perrier and Bassot in France and Algeria.  In 1879, Ibáñez de Ibero for Spain and François Perrier for France directed the junction of the Spanish geodetic network with Algeria.  This connection was a remarkable enterprise where triangles with a maximum length of 270 km were observed from mountain stations over the Mediterranean Sea. The triangulation of France was then connected to those of Great Britain, Spain and Algeria and thus the Paris meridian's arc measurement extended from Shetland to the Sahara.\n\nThe fundamental co-ordinates of the Panthéon were also obtained anew, by connecting the Panthéon and the Paris Observatory with the five stations of Bry-sur-Marne, Morlu, Mont Valérien, Chatillon and Montsouris, where the observations of latitude and azimuth were effected.\n\nGeodesy and metrology \nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Wilhelm von Struve invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. Notably the geodetic standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the toise, of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for Bouguer and De La Condamine as their standard of reference in the French Geodesic Mission, conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa.\n\nAlexander Ross Clarke and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the Europäische Gradmessung and the General Conference of the association proposed the metre as a uniform length standard for the Arc measurement and recommended the establishment of an International Metre Commission.\n\nThe Europäische Gradmessung decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Metre Convention was signed in 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. The first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures was the Spanish geodesist Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the Europäische Gradmessung from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the International Geodetic Association (German: Internationale Erdmessung) and Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the International Geodetic Association gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the Europäische Gradmessung proposed to select the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian in the hope that Great Britain would accede to the Metre Convention.\n\nFrom the Paris meridian to the Greenwich meridian \nThe United States passed an Act of Congress on 3 August 1882, authorizing President Chester A. Arthur to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world. Before the invitations were sent out on December 1, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways' General Time Convention and Managing Editor of the Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways, had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883 across the nation. Although this was not legally established until 1918, there was thus a strong sense of fait accompli that preceded the International Meridian Conference, although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference.\n\nIn 1884, at the International Meridian Conference in Washington DC, the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the prime meridian of the world. San Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against. France and Brazil abstained. The United Kingdom acceded to the Metre Convention in 1884 and to the International Geodetic Association in 1898. In 1911, Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert stated in the Encyclopædia Britannica :\n\n\"According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, a [the equatorial radius of the Earth] = 6,377,935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15. [...] The net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the meridian of Greenwich is nearer the mean than that of Paris (Helmert, Grösse d. Erde).\"\n\nThe French clung to the Paris meridian as a rival to Greenwich until 1911 for timekeeping purposes and 1914 for navigation. To this day, French cartographers continue to indicate the Paris meridian on some maps.\n\nFrom wireless telegraphy to Coordinated Universal Time \nWith the arrival of wireless telegraphy, France established a transmitter on the Eiffel Tower in order to broadcast a time signal. The creation of the International Time Bureau, seated at the Paris Observatory, was decided upon during the 1912 Conférence internationale de l'heure radiotélégraphique. The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an international convention. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of World War I. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the International Commission of Time, one of the commissions of the then newly founded International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nFrom 1956 until 1987 the International Time Bureau was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of Atomic Time were taken over by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the celestial reference frame and the Earth's rotation in order to realize the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) were taken over by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) which was established in its present form in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).\n\nThe Arago medallions \n\nIn 1994 the Arago Association and the city of Paris commissioned a Dutch conceptual artist, Jan Dibbets, to create a memorial to Arago.  Dibbets came up with the idea of setting 135 bronze medallions (although only 121 are documented in the official guide to the medallions) into the ground along the Paris meridian between the northern and southern limits of Paris: a total distance of 9.2 kilometres/5.7 miles. Each medallion is 12 cm in diameter and marked with the name ARAGO plus N and S pointers.\n\nAnother project, the Green Meridian (An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte), aimed to establish a plantation of trees along the entire length of the meridian arc in France. Several missing Arago medallions appear to have been replaced with the newer 'An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte' markers.\n\nEsoteric interpretations \n\nIn certain circles, some kind of occult or esoteric significance is ascribed to the Paris meridian; sometimes it is even perceived as a sinister axis. Dominique Stezepfandts, a French conspiracy theorist, attacks the Arago medallions that supposedly trace the route of \"an occult geographical line\". To him the Paris meridian is a \"Masonic axis\" or even \"the heart of the Devil.\"\n\nHenry Lincoln, in his book The Holy Place, argues that various ancient structures are aligned according to the Paris meridian. They even include medieval churches, built long before the meridian was established according to conventional history, and Lincoln finds it obvious that the meridian \"was based upon the 'cromlech intersect division line'.\" David Wood, in his book Genesis, likewise ascribes a deeper significance to the Paris meridian and takes it into account when trying to decipher the geometry of the myth-encrusted village of Rennes-le-Château: The meridian passes about 350 metres (1,150 ft) west of the site of the so-called \"Poussin tomb,\" an important location in the legends and esoteric theories relating to that place. A sceptical discussion of these theories, including the supposed alignments, can be found in Bill Putnam and Edwin Wood's book The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château - A mystery solved.\n\nThe meridian line, dubbed the \"Rose Line\" by author Dan Brown appeared in the novel The Da Vinci Code.\n\nSee also \n French cartography\n Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790)\n Principal Triangulation of Great Britain\n Meridian arc\n History of geodesy\nHistory of the metre\nSeconds pendulum\n Struve Geodetic Arc\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n   Better formatted mathematics at Wikisource.\n The Arago medallions on Google Earth\n Full Meridian of Glory: Perilous Adventures in the Competition to Measure the Earth: history of science book by Prof. Paul Murdin\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian, by Graham Dolan\n\nNamed meridians\nGeography of Paris\nGeography of France\nHistory of Paris\nPrime meridians\nGeodesy\nMetrology\nGeography of England\nGeography of Spain\nGeography of Algeria\nParis Observatory", "machine_text": " Paris meridian The Paris meridian is a line of longitude that runs through the Paris Observatory in Paris, France. It is one of the two prime meridians, the other being the Greenwich meridian. The Paris meridian was first proposed in the 18th century by the French astronomer Jerome Lalande. In 1884, it was agreed that the Paris meridian would be the starting point for the measurement of a longitudinal degree, which would be 5,010 minutes of longitude. The Paris meridian forms the basis of the French territorial claim to possessions in the South Atlantic, including the island of Saint Helena. The Paris meridian is also known as the French meridian. However, in French, it is called the méridien de Paris. The term \"Paris meridian\" is now rarely used, as the term \"prime meridian\" is used to refer to the Greenwich meridian. The Paris meridian is 90 degrees west of the Greenwich meridian. The two meridians are approximately 5 degrees apart. The two meridians meet at the north and south poles, and the two are separated by the International Date Line. The Paris meridian is a key location for the measurement of a longitudinal degree. The International Meridian Conference, which was held in 1884, agreed that a longitudinal degree would be 5,010 minutes of longitude. The conference, which was attended by representatives from 25 countries, also agreed that the Paris meridian would be the starting point for the measurement of a longitudinal degree.

Foley. The 2006 election was notable for the high number of Republicans who voted for Rell, giving her a victory in her bid for a full term over Foley, a moderate Republican who had been the state's comptroller. Rell won by 3,000 votes, with 823,000 votes cast for her and 805,000 votes cast for Foley. Rell received the votes of 84% of Republicans, while Foley received the votes of 94% of Democrats. The election had a margin of victory of 3,000 votes, out of 2,232,000 votes cast. Rell was the first woman to be elected governor of Connecticut, the first Republican woman governor in the United States, and the first governor of any U.S. state to have been appointed to her first term. The 2006 Connecticut Gubernatorial Election was certified by the Secretary of the State on November 28, 2006. Results by county As of the 2006 election, Connecticut's voting system allows a candidate to win the governorship without receiving the majority of the vote. This is because the state has no plurality rule; candidates can win all electoral votes with less than 50% of the popular vote, which would otherwise be the minimum for a majority. In this election, Rell received 49.4% of the vote, while Foley received 48.6%. Rell carried six of the state's eight counties. The largest margin of victory was in Rell's home county of Tolland, where she won by a margin of 9.4%. The largest percentage of votes received by Rell was in Tolland County, where she received 58.2% of the vote. The largest percentage of votes received by Foley was in Hartford County, where he received 54.3% of the vote. The only county Rell lost was New Haven, the state's most populous county, where she received 42.9% of the vote to Foley's 57.1%. In the cities, Rell received 46.9% of the vote in Hartford, the state's capital and largest city, to Foley's 53.1%. In Waterbury, the state's second largest city, Rell received 40.8% of the vote to Foley's 59.2%. In New Haven, the state's third largest city, Rell received 42.3% of the vote to Foley's 57.7%. Voter registration As of August 2006, 2,068,300 voters were registered in Connecticut. This represented an increase of 1.8% from the 2,041,332 voters registered in August 2004. The number of voters per capita was 3.5, one of the lowest in the United States. Voter turnout Voter turnout in the 2006 Connecticut gubernatorial election was 68.6%, the highest it had been since 1986. This was 5.2 percentage points higher than the national turnout rate of 63.4% in the 2006 elections. Of the 3,068,532 residents of the state, 2,069,325 were registered to vote. Of these, 1,332,672 actually voted, for a turnout rate of 68.6%. The highest turnout rates were in the towns of Simsbury, Granby, Suffield, Avon, and Manchester. The lowest turnout rates were in the cities of Waterbury, New Haven, and Hartford. Municipalities The highest percentage of votes received by Rell was in the town of Simsbury, where she received 77.3% of the vote. The highest percentage of votes received by Foley was in the town of Windsor Locks, where he received 72.1% of the vote. The following is a table of the largest municipalities in the state, and how they voted in the 2006 election. The numbers in parentheses are the number of votes by which the winning candidate defeated the runner-up.

An angular rate sensor is a type of inertial sensor that is used to measure the non-comitant or non-centripetal acceleration, in other words the angular acceleration, of a moving object. However, due to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, the body will always move in a straight line unless an external force is applied. Therefore, an angular rate sensor will only measure the angular acceleration if it is induced by an external force. An angular rate sensor is a device which measures the speed of rotation at which an object is moving. angular rate sensors are often used in the field of robotics, in which a rotating object such as a motor or a spinning wheel is a fundamental component. They can also be used in the field of virtual reality, in which a person's head movements are tracked in order to update the image on a screen. The basic principle of the angular rate sensor is that it contains a mass that is able to move in a plane. As the object moves, the mass will experience an acceleration in the direction of the movement. This acceleration will cause the mass to move out of the plane. The amount by which the mass moves out of the plane will depend on the angular velocity of the object. The sensor will then be able to detect the position of the mass and determine the angular velocity. There are many different types of angular rate sensors. One type is the gyroscope. A gyroscope is a sensor that is able to measure the angular velocity of an object by detecting the amount by which it rotates around a fixed axis. Another type of angular rate sensor is the accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor that is able to measure the acceleration of an object by detecting the amount by which it moves in a straight line.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 22152302}

Some authors say that it comes from the word \"apostle\", which means \" messenger of the gospel\" in Greek. Others say that it comes from the word \"apostoles\", which means \" Application of the law\" in Latin. The first mention of the word Apóstoles in relation to the present territory dates back to 1703. The town of Apóstoles was founded on 3 October 1883, by Juan Cruz, who came from the province of San Juan with his wife Gregoria Cruz, and their children. The area was then part of the county (currutche) of Jáchal. The foundation was authorized by the goverment of San Juan, which at that time was a province of the same name. The town was then located on the right bank of the Jáchal River, near the present location of the town of Jáchal. In 1886 the town was moved to its present location, due to the floods of the river. In 1840, during the wars against the indigenous people, the area of Apóstoles was the scene of a battle between the forces led by General Juan Manuel de Rosas, who won, and the forces of the Indians, who were defeated. The Indians who survived the battle fled to the south, to the region of the pampas.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tom Henke\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Thomas Anthony Henke (born December 21, 1957), nicknamed \"The Terminator\", is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He was one of the most dominant and feared closers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, pitching for the Texas Rangers (1982–1984, 1993–1994), Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1992), and St. Louis Cardinals (1995).\n\nOn the mound, Henke was easily recognizable by the large-rimmed glasses he wore at a time when many players began using contact lenses.  At a height of 6' 5\", he cast an imposing figure and dominated batters with his hard fastball early in the count, and his forkball for the strikeout.  Henke struck out 9.8 batters per 9 innings pitched over his career.\n\nEarly life\nTom Henke was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and started out throwing every night to his father, who caught his pitches while sitting on a five-gallon bucket. \"Every kid should have a dad like that\", Henke said. He grew up in Taos, Missouri and attended Blair Oaks High School. After high school, Henke played at East Central Junior College. In 1980, a couple of friends, who believed Henke had pro-caliber stuff, told him they would buy the beer if he showed up at a talent evaluation opportunity; he did and was noticed.\n\nCareer\nHenke was drafted on June 5, 1979, by the Seattle Mariners in the 20th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. On January 11, 1980, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the first round (24th pick) of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft (January Secondary) but again did not sign. Henke signed with the Texas Rangers after being selected in the fourth round of the 1980 amateur draft (June Secondary).\n\nTexas Rangers (1982–1984)\nAfter signing with the Rangers, Henke was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Rangers in the Gulf Coast League where he had immediate success, going 3-3 with a 0.95 ERA in 38 innings, earning a promotion to the Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. In 1981, Henke started the season back at Asheville, where his 8-6 record with 3 saves and 2.93 ERA in 92 innings earned him a promotion to the AA Tulsa Drillers in the Texas League. Henke spent the entire 1982 minor league season back at Tulsa, despite putting up similarly impressive numbers (14 saves with a 2.67 ERA and 100 strikeouts in  innings). He did, however, see time with the Rangers at the end of the season and made his major league debut on September 10. In 1983, Henke was finally promoted to the Oklahoma City 89ers in the American Association, but again his development stalled and he spent much of the next three seasons at AAA. Despite strong numbers in the minors and similar numbers during his intermittent times in Texas, Henke was labeled as a pitcher who had trouble finding the strike zone (finishing with 20 walks in  innings with the Rangers in 1984) and appeared to be the odd man out in the Rangers' bullpen.\n\nToronto Blue Jays (1985–1992)\nHowever, Henke was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Rangers on January 24, 1985, as a free agent compensation pick. After blazing through the hitters at AAA Syracuse to the tune of a 0.88 ERA and 18 saves in  innings over 38 appearances, he won the International League Most Valuable Pitcher Award in 1985. Henke was promoted to Toronto during the 1985 pennant drive and never looked back, not allowing a run in his first 11 appearances and finished the season with 13 saves. Henke was then made the team's closer in 1986, and played a major role in the Toronto Blue Jays' successful run from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, finishing with 217 saves with the team and helping Toronto to its first championship, a six-game defeat of the Atlanta Braves in the 1992 World Series.\n\nTexas Rangers II (1993–1994) \nIn 1993, as a free agent, Henke signed with the Texas Rangers for two years. Henke had a career-high 40 saves in 1993. In 1994, he had only 15 saves due to spending time on the disabled list.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1995)\nHenke, age 37, signed with the Cardinals for the 1995 season after two years with the Texas Rangers. The closer converted his first 22 saves for the team in 1995 ending with 36 total saves for the year. Henke was honored with the St. Louis Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association (BBWAA) J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award. Despite having just finished one of the best seasons of his career and 22nd in MVP voting,\n Henke decided to retire at the end of the 1995 season. \"I’ve always admired guys who have gone out at the top of their game,\" Henke said. \"Sometimes you have to look at what’s the most important thing in life. I’d like to see my kids grow up.\"\n\nCareer milestones\nOver his 14-year career, Henke was named to the All-Star team twice: 1987, when he led the American League with 34 saves and 62 games finished, and 1995, his last season, and only season in the National League. He also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1995. \n\nHenke was the seventh reliever to eclipse the 300 saves plateau and when he retired his 311 career saves ranked 5th on the all-time career list. \n\nOther career accomplishments are:\n14 MLB season, 789.2 IP\n2.67 ERA\n1.092 WHIP\n255 walks to 861 Ks for a 3.38 SO/BB ratio\n.982 fielding percentage\nPlayoff stats: 19.2 IP / 2-0 / 1.83 ERA / 0.966 WHIP / 5 saves (all saves in 1992 playoffs for World Champion Blue Jays.)\n\nPersonal\nHenke lives on his  farm in Taos, Missouri, with his family: wife Kathy and children Linsay, Ryan, Kim, and Amanda (who has Down syndrome). \n\nHenke met his wife Kathy in college. \"My catcher one day said, 'Let's go to McDonald's' and Kathy was working there at the time\", Henke said. \"She sold me a Big Mac and I was done. She was tall and athletic and I was pretty shy. Turns out we had a class together and started talking\".\n\nComing from a small town with a population under 900, Henke admitted he initially had to overcome a fear of big cities. \"I hated going to New York City\", he said. \"I felt like a fish out of water there. I’d go from the hotel to Yankee Stadium and that's it. It took me two or three years before I went out to visit the Statue of Liberty and I never took the subway.\" On living in Toronto, Henke said \"I rented an apartment downtown for two or three years and that wasn’t for me. I’m just a guy from a small town and that's where I’m most comfortable\".\n\nCharity involvement \nSince 1995, Henke has teamed with the Jefferson City, Missouri Cosmo Club to hold the annual Tom Henke Charity Classic Golf Tournament which raises money for the Special Learning Center, a school for handicapped children. He also volunteers with Down syndrome charities, the Special Olympics and the Cancer Society, and is on the board of directors with the Missouri Department of Mental Health.\n\nIn popular culture \nHenke's nickname, \"The Terminator\", was given to him by teammate John Cerutti in 1985 after they saw the movie The Terminator together.\n\nThe Ballad Of Tom Henke was written as a tribute to Henke's life story and \"termination\" of opposing batters. The  45 was released in 1985. Side 2 has The Tom Henke Rag song, an instrumental.\n\nHenke appeared in a TV commercial for Aqua Velva.\n\nHonors \n\nIn 2000, Henke was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. \n\nOn August 9, 2009, the Toronto Blue Jays honored Henke with a figurine giveaway bearing his likeness.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, Henke threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Busch Stadium during the Washington Nationals vs St. Louis Cardinals baseball game.\n\nOn January 24, 2011, Henke was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Hall during a ceremony at St Marys, Ontario, on June 18, 2011.\n\nOn August 14, 2016, a final ceremony of three with Blue Jays' all-time greats was held to celebrate the club's 40th Anniversary. Henke represented the bullpen along with Duane Ward and Mike Timlin. Former Blue Jays starters Roy Halladay, Dave Stieb, Pat Hentgen and Juan Guzman were welcomed back too. The entire group exemplified top arms in club history.\n\nIn November 2018, Henke was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSee also\n\nList of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTom Henke at Baseball Almanac\n\n1957 births\nLiving people\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Canada\nAmerican League All-Stars\nAmerican League saves champions\nAsheville Tourists players\nBaseball players from Kansas City, Missouri\nCanadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\nGulf Coast Rangers players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nOklahoma City 89ers players\nPeople from Cole County, Missouri\nSt. Louis Cardinals players\nSyracuse Chiefs players\nTexas Rangers players\nToronto Blue Jays players\nTulsa Drillers players", "machine_text": " Tom Henke (born March 24, 1961) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

Henke was a member of the Rangers' rotation from 1984 to 1989, and was the team's sole representative in the 1984 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was traded to the Cardinals in 1990, and led the National League in saves in 1991 with 43. He was dealt to the Athletics in 1992, then signed as a free agent with the Mets in 1993. In 1994 he was 2–0 with a 2.93 ERA and 42 saves, and was named to the All-Star Game. He served as the Mets' closer from 1993 to 1997, and was the team's co-MVP in 1995. He was traded to the Blue Jays in 1997, and finished his career with the Dodgers in 1998. Injuries limited Henke to only 37 appearances in 1998, and he was not offered a contract by the Dodgers for the 1999 season. He signed with the Rangers for one final major league campaign in 2000, and also played for the independent Kissimmee Cobras that year. Henke's 200 career saves are the fourth-highest total in baseball history.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Sheila Kitzinger\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sheila Helena Elizabeth Kitzinger MBE (29 March 1929 – 11 April 2015) was a British natural childbirth activist and author on childbirth and pregnancy. She wrote more than 20 books and had a worldwide reputation as a passionate and committed advocate for change.\n\nLife and work \nKitzinger was born in Taunton, Somerset. She was a social anthropologist specialising in pregnancy, childbirth and the parenting of babies and young children.  She campaigned for women to have the information they need to make choices about childbirth and was a well known advocate for breastfeeding. She joined the advisory board of the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in 1958 as a teacher and trainer.\n\nShe held academic posts at the University of Edinburgh and the Open University, and was an honorary professor at the University of West London, where she taught the MA in midwifery in the Wolfson School of Health Sciences. She also taught workshops on the social anthropology of birth and breastfeeding. She wrote many articles and books and was active in midwifery education in the UK and internationally. She lectured widely in the USA and Canada, the Caribbean, Israel, Australia, Latin America, South Africa and Japan and worked as a consultant to the International Childbirth Education Association.\n\nShe was a strong believer that all women who are not at high risk should be given the choice of a home birth. Her books cover women's experiences of breastfeeding, antenatal care, birth plans, induction of labour, epidurals, episiotomy, hospital care in childbirth, children's experiences of being present at birth and post traumatic stress following childbirth. Some of her writing was controversial for its time; The Good Birth Guide (1979) may have caused a rift in her relationship with the NCT and she was often at odds with radical feminist views. Her work is considered influential in changing the culture in which women give birth She believed that: \"Birth is a major life transition. It is – must be – also a political issue, in terms of the power of the medical system, how it exercises control over women and whether it enables them to make decisions about their own bodies and their babies.\" She was awarded an MBE in 1982 in recognition of her services to education for childbirth.\n\nIn 1987 she made an extended appearance on television in the first series of Channel 4's After Dark.  From the late 1980s she was series editor for Pandora Press's Issues in Women’s Health; the books in this series included her own The Midwife Challenge, and also Gabrielle Palmer's seminal The Politics of Breastfeeding.\n\nKitzinger died of cancer in Oxfordshire in 2015 after a short illness. Her autobiography, A Passion for Birth: My Life: Anthropology, Family and Feminism, was published shortly after her death.

Kitzinger was born in 1925 in Essex, England. After studying at Oxford University, she became a teacher, and married her husband John in 1949. In 1951, she gave birth to a daughter, and in 1953 to a son. Both her children were born at home. In the early 1960s, she and her family moved to the United States, where she studied the history of social and sexual attitudes to pregnancy and birth. Kitzinger was a visiting fellow at the University of Kent, and a fellow at the Institute of Social and Cultural Analytics at the University of Sydney. In 2000, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of West London.

He grew up in the city of Ferrol, nearby. As a teenager, he joined the rock band Panker, which was formed by his brother Jorge and the brothers Juan and Antonio Vandevalle. The group won a local contest with their song \"Punk-er\", and soon acquired a strong local following. In the early 1970s, Panker moved to Madrid in search of a record deal, and they soon came under the influence of other rock bands of the day, such as Slade, Tangerine Dream, and Pink Floyd. Their first two albums, Panker and Panker 2, were released by the independent label Grabaciones Accidentales, and were characterized by their clean and elaborate guitar lines, and their elaborate lyrics, in which the members of the band made use of the latest slang from the world of rock. After these first two albums, the band's style evolved, becoming more sophisticated and complex. Their third album, Panker 3, was released in 1977. After this album, the band split up, and Manuel Izquierdo began a solo career.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 11309523}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Doherty amplifier\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Doherty amplifier is a modified class B radio frequency amplifier invented by William H. Doherty of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in 1936. Whereas conventional class B amplifiers can clip on high input-signal levels, the Doherty power amplifier can accommodate signals with high peak-to-average power ratios by using two amplifier circuits within the one overall amplifier to accommodate the different signal levels.  In this way, the amplifier achieves a high level of linearity while retaining good power efficiency.\n\nIn Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000-watt implementation, the driver was a complete 5,000-watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000-watt level to the required 50,000-watt level.\n\nThe amplifier was usually configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier–peak amplifier using two vacuum tubes in parallel connection, one as a class B carrier tube and the other as a class B peak tube (power transistors in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and −90 degree phase shifting networks. Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid carrier tube and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed-through the carrier tube and was added to the resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementations rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.\n\nSuccessor broadcast developments\nAs successor to Western Electric Company Inc. for radio broadcast transmitters, the Doherty concept was considerably refined by Continental Electronics Manufacturing Company of Dallas, Texas.\n\nEarly Continental Electronics designs, by James O. Weldon and others, retained most of the characteristics of Doherty's amplifier but added medium-level screen-grid modulation of the driver (317B, et al.).\n\nA further refinement of Doherty's amplifier was the high-level screen-grid modulation scheme invented by Joseph B. Sainton (317C, et al.).\n\nSainton's 317C series consisted of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and −90 degree phase-shifting networks as in Doherty's amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier was applied to the control grids of both tubes with the same control grid bias points. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes, but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power, and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power was required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage.\n\nIn addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent, and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose tubes, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50G, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, being employed only in the BTA-50G.\n\nNearly 300 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined, until the development of successor high-power transistorized designs.\n\nNon-broadcast developments\nModern communication systems have seen sudden resurrection of Doherty amplifiers in 4G and pre-5G massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO) based base-stations. The fact that modern communication systems use complex signal modulation schemes like OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with high peak-to-peak average power ration (PAPR), the probability of amplifier operating at its peak power with its maximum efficiency is very low. The property to Doherty amplifier exhibiting multiple efficiency peaks at various lower power levels makes it an attractive option to boost the average efficiency of modern-day transmitters. The Doherty amplifier can accomplish by using a technique called \"Dynamic Load Modulation\" wherein the load seen by the main amplifier changes as a function of power level in-order to boost the efficiency at lower power levels.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n − US Patent\n \n\nElectronic amplifiers\nValve amplifiers", "machine_text": " A Doherty amplifier is a type of radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) that uses a modified class B push–pull amplifier topology. It was invented by William H. Doherty in 1936 as a method of efficient amplification of radio frequency signals. In a Doherty amplifier, the input signal is split in two, and the two halves of the signal are amplified by different types of amplifier circuits. The output of one of these amplifiers is then delayed and combined with the output of the other amplifier to produce the amplified signal. The combining of the two outputs in this manner allows the amplifiers to use the best features of both Class B and Class C amplification, and to minimize the weaknesses of each. The Doherty amplifier is a form of linear power amplifier; by contrast, class-B amplifiers are known for their nonlinear output. Doherty amplifiers are used in many RF applications, such as radio broadcasting, signal transmission, and radio frequency heating. They are particularly useful for applications where the signal is a complex (non-sine) wave, and where a linear amplification is required. They are also used in military applications such as military radars. In the field of radio astronomy, wideband Doherty amplifiers are used as the front end of receivers, to amplify signals from astronomical objects. Doherty amplifiers can also be used to amplify signals with a high peak-to-average ratio (PAR). In such applications, the Doherty amplifier is combined with a switched amplifier in an arrangement known as a Doherty switched amplifier. The switched amplifier provides additional amplification for the peaks of the signal, which allows the Doherty amplifier to be operated in a more linear region. The Doherty amplifier is named after its inventor, William Henry Doherty. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1900, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto in 1923. He then went to work for the Canadian Marconi Company, where he was involved in the development of radio broadcasting in Canada. In 1936, he left the company to work as a freelance consultant. In 1950, he became a professor at the University of Toronto, and was later appointed the head of the Department of Electrical Engineering. He died in Toronto in 1997.

Forbes named him at #6 on its list of top \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\".\n\nCareer\n\nEarly years\nAfter completing his studies at Wisconsin, Rahman went to work at Intel. With the Intel team, he developed an Itanium microprocessor chip between 1991 and 1996 and left the job after looking at the dot-com bubble rise in order to start his own company. In 1997, Rahman and a partner started a company that installed cameras in daycare centers, allowing parents to watch the video streams online in real time. Edaycare.com attracted $2.5 million from investors, including Ron Conway, an early stage investor of Google and PayPal. A year later Rahman and his partner ran out of money, forcing them to sell the company for stock that was beneficially worthless.\n\nNaseeb Networks, Inc.\nAfter a hiatus of four years and working as a consultant, Rahman decided to start a social networking site for Muslims in the United States and United Kingdom, after looking at the success of similar website Friendster.com. He named it \"Naseeb.com\" (meaning \"destiny\"). Built as a social site, it was considered more of match-making portal, but Rahman said, \"I decided not to go head-on as a matchmaking site... 'Dating' has a negative stigma from a Muslim viewpoint.\" Naseeb.com was then invested in by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman with $25,000, while Mark Pincus of Zynga and Joe Kraus of Excite also stepped in as angel investors.\n\nDescribing the inspiration behind Naseeb, Rahman said, \"I was exploring the Pakistani market since my family had moved here. I realized that the biggest cost in running a web company was of human capital. And the running cost in Pakistan would have been 1/18th of what it would have been in the US. So that's when I decided to come back and start Naseeb.com, which exploded very quickly. We were the first one to be doing any kind of serious business on the internet back then. And we had little to no competition in the market.\"\n\nIn 2002, Rahman returned to Pakistan and registered his company as Naseeb Networks, Inc., both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in San Jose, California, US, to make it easier to raise money and investors. He spent $60,000 as a startup cost for Naseeb and initially handled the company on his own. To prime the market, he used equity in the company to buy the electronic greeting card site eidmubarak.com, which allow Muslims to send cards for Eid, a Muslim holiday. Three thousand people from the site's 1-million-strong mailing list signed up immediately. Annual memberships cost $40, and by 2005 the website was generating $300,000 in revenue.\n\nWith the expansion of company Rahman needed programmers and developers, and buying ads in local newspapers was expensive. He recalls, \"I started Naseeb.com from my house, but later moved out as we grew. Now when hiring, I ran into a lot of problems finding the right talent. At that time, one job ad in the classified section in Dawn News, roughly cost PKR 850,000 which was ridiculous! So I decided to put my ads online.\"\n\nRozee.pk\n \nIn 2005, Rahman built a \"quick and dirty\" job site to post job openings for his parent company Naseeb Networks. Many other companies contacted Rahman to post their companies' and products' ads on his website. Rahman agreed to post their ads free of cost to help boost Naseeb's traffic. After receiving such a reception, the website became the primary business of Naseeb Networks.\n\nRahman then offered the largest companies the ability to search for résumés, as well as software to power their own companys' job boards and the right to post their logos on the front page of his new site. He named it \"Rozee\", an Urdu language word which means \"livelihood\", or translates roughly as \"blessed livelihood.\"\n\nIn 2007 Rozee.pk went into a completely functioning state, generating more traffic than Naseeb. Rahman used Naseeb's proceeds, and $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and ePlanet Ventures, to hire salespeople to go after large corporate clients, most of which still advertised job openings in newspapers. More than 63 000 companies actively post openings on Rozee.pk, paying between $29 for a single ad and up to $20,000 for a suite of services.\n\nRozee.pk has been listed as the number one employment website in Pakistan, with more than 65 thousand companies posting jobs, 32.53 million applications processed and 6 million unique visitors every day. In 2015, Rozee.pk won $6.5 million of investment from Vostok Nafta and Piton Capital, bringing the company's total venture capital funding to $8.5 million.\n\nIn an interview Rahman stated, \"As talent continues to move online at a rapid pace in emerging markets, businesses need increasingly sophisticated recruiting technology customized to nuanced local market dynamics.\"\n\nIt was the latest in a series of large venture capital investments in Pakistan over the previous year and a half. Managing director Per Brilioth said, \"We are excited to partner with Naseeb Networks and impressed with what Rahman and his team have achieved in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia... We believe these markets present massive growth opportunities and are looking forward to working with the team to expand the reach of Naseeb Networks' world-class products and services.\" Michael Porter of AllWorld Network listed the company as one of Pakistan's fastest growing private companies. American writer Elmira Bayrasli visited Pakistan in 2010 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of the country and listed Rahman as an \"example to entrepreneurs\" in her 2015 book, From the Other Side of the World. She claimed that the \"next Silicon Valley could be in Lahore, Mumbai or Istanbul.\"\n\nChalo.pk\nIn 2011, Rahman launched a location-based online shopping portal that features \"local daily deals and listings for the most affordable things to do, place to eat, and brands to buy\" in cities throughout Pakistan. Rahman said, \"Chalo is my experiment. We have hundreds of SMEs in Pakistan who can't afford to promote themselves on large platforms like newspapers, billboards, TV etc. We're helping them expand & grow through Chalo.pk... We're also experimenting with Maps. We spent 2 years building our own maps database, and now we have mapped every single house address in any planned society in Lahore. We’ve also mapped all the restaurants, their menus and other details in the app. So people can navigate to them really easily. If you want to watch a movie, we're listing all the movies being shown in all the cities, and soon we'll be adding a Buy button.\"\n\nDigital Publishers Association of Pakistan\nIn 2012, Rahman co-founded the Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), with several publications and portal owners including Masood Hamid (President), Monis Rahman (Vice President), Sarmad A. Ali (Member Executive Committee), Lucas Peter (Secretary General), Imran Ansari (Joint Secretary), Qudratullah Shahab (Member Executive Committee), and Sarah Sohail (Finance Secretary). The association aims to \"safeguard interests of all stakeholders in the burgeoning digital market and create a regulated playing field.\"\n\nMihnati.com acquisition\nIn 2013, Rozee.pk bought Saudi employment website Mihnati.com for an undisclosed amount. Discussing the acquisition, Rahman said, \"We have merged both Rozee.pk and Mihnati by migrating all Mihnati employers and jobseekers on to the Rozee.pk technology platform. By doing this, we gave our Saudi sales team a far more powerful product to sell with more features.\"\n\nOther works and future ventures\nAfter establishing himself, Rahman served as a head or partner of several technology firms in Pakistan, including as a member of the board of directors at Kashf Microfinance Bank Limited  (2010-2012), and of the Pakistan Advisory Board at Acumen Fund (2010-2013). Currently he is a member of the Young Presidents' Organization (2010) Governing Board (CEC) at Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITES (P@SHA) (2013), Secretary General and founding member at Digital Publishers Association of Pakistan (DPAP), and a member of the Global Board of Trustees (BoT) at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE, Lahore) (2012).\n\nRahman is regarded as one of the best entrepreneurs of the country. Many have listed him in their top ten lists of CEOs and entrepreneurs. In 2016, Rahman was listed among the top CEOs of Pakistan, was placed at No. 6 among the Top 10 Most Influential Tech Leaders of Pakistan, and was ranked at #3 among the \"Top 5 E-commerce Business Tycoons of Pakistan\". Rahman is a TED speaker and is frequently invited to talk on entrepreneurship and Internet marketing at the world's top business schools and conferences.\n\nIn 2016, Rahman together with Qasif Shahid developed a digital mobile wallet to increase digital payments' scale rapidly. The mobile wallet is telco, bank and handset agnostic with the philosophy of inter-operating collaboratively with existing payment plumbing. It is jointly funded by Finca Microfinance Bank and the e-company Finja. In an interview Qasif said, \"We believe banking products should look more like social networks than conventional banking products.\"  Rahman said, \"Our mobile wallet's open API platform will allow much needed collaborative creativity from other FinTechs to be leveraged to create building blocks for a wider array of useful financial products.\"\n\nAwards and honors\n 2008: International Data Group CIO Pakistan Pioneer in Innovation Award\n 2011: Forbes \"Ten Big Hitting Asian Businessmen under 50\"\n 2012: Pakistan Power 100 Excellence Award\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Rahman's profile at Rozee.pk\n \n Rahman at Naseeb Networks, Inc.\n\nLiving people\nBusinesspeople in computing\nPakistani computer businesspeople\nStanford University alumni\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison alumni\nPakistani expatriates in Saudi Arabia\nPakistani expatriates in the United States\nPakistani venture capitalists\nSilicon Valley people\nPakistani company founders\nBusinesspeople from Lahore\nYear of birth missing (living people)", "machine_text": " Monis Rahman is a British Pakistani entrepreneur, founder of UKFinances.com, and former CEO of Gatecoin, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Sir Maurice Eustace (c. 1590 – 22 June 1665) was an Irish  landowner, politician, barrister  and judge of the seventeenth century who spent the last years of his career as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. This was an office for which he felt himself to be entirely unfit,  and in which he was universally agreed to be a failure.\n\nFamily background\nEustace was born in about 1590, at Castlemartin, County Kildare, eldest of the three sons of John FitzWilliam Eustace, Constable of Naas (died 1623). Little is known of his mother, whose name is thought to be Catherine d'Arcy. Of  his sisters, one sister, whose name is variously given as Elizabeth or Elinor, married Edmund Keating and had two sons, Oliver and John Keating, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, while  another, Alice, married Robert Cusack of Rathgar  Castle, but was  apparently not  the mother of his son Adam Cusack. \n\nThe Eustaces of Castlemartin were a branch of the prominent \"Old English\"  FitzEustace family who held the title Viscount Baltinglass, but unlike their Baltinglass cousins, the Castlemartin branch of the Eustace family played no part in the Desmond Rebellions of the 1580s, most of them being noted for their loyalty to the English Crown. Maurice in time was to recover much of the property forfeited by his Baltinglass cousins, which remained in the family into the eighteenth century. In matters of religion the family was  deeply divided in sympathy; the judge's granduncle, also named Maurice Eustace, was denounced to the authorities as a Jesuit in 1581, tried for high treason, found guilty and executed. The judge himself, though a Protestant, was exceptionally tolerant in matters of religion, to the point of lobbying for increased civil rights for Catholics.\n\nA later Sir Maurice Eustace, 1st Baronet, first and last of the Eustace baronets of Castle Martin, belonged to the same branch of the family, being a grandson of one of the Chancellor's uncles: he should not be confused with a third Sir Maurice Eustace who was the Lord Chancellor's nephew, nor with the Lord Chancellor's natural son, who was yet another Maurice.\n\nEarly career\nEustace attended the  University of Dublin, and after graduating he became a fellow of the University, and its lecturer in Hebrew. In his will, he left a legacy to maintain a Hebrew lecture at Trinity.  However he had set his heart on a legal career,  and after two years he resigned from the fellowship and entered Lincoln's Inn. He was also determined on a career in politics,  and he had made a  number  of useful political contacts through his father, who knew the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison,  and other senior officials.\n\nHe spent some time in England after he was called to the Bar,  but he was back in Dublin by 1630. He quickly built up an extremely lucrative legal practice; it was said he could \"earn forty gold pieces in a morning\". From quite early in his career he aimed at the office of Prime Serjeant.\n\nHe entered the Irish House of Commons in 1634 as the member for Athy. Unlike some of the \"Old English\", he was a whole-hearted supporter of the powerful and formidable Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford,  who in return praised Eustace as a man of integrity and ability, and knighted  him.  Their friendship led to a  rift between Eustace and Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus, the Lord Chancellor, who had befriended him and frequently employed his legal services, but who became an implacable opponent of Strafford. Eustace became Prime Serjeant, then the senior Crown legal adviser, a position he had lobbied for over several years. As Serjeant he acted as an extra justice of assize in 1637, at the request of Wentworth, who wished to curb the ambition of the rising barrister Jerome Alexander, who had hoped to gain preferment by acting as an assize judge, but whom Wentworth detested.  In 1640 Maurice was re-elected to the Commons as the member for County Kildare and became Speaker of the House. His formal speech of welcome to Wentworth at the opening of the 1640 Parliament is  a good example of his ornate style of oratory, which was much admired at the time:\n\n\"Welcome, most worthy Lord, to the new birth of this our Parliament; this is the voice of the House of Commons, and I am sure it is the voice of the whole assembly; it is beside Vox Populi abroad, and I am sure it is Vox Dei\".\n\nThe Speaker also received a generous salary, which appears to have amounted to a single payment of £3000. In the 1660s and 1670s Dame Dorothy Ryves, widow and executrix of Sir William Ryves, who had been acting Speaker of the Irish  House of Lords  during the later sessions of the same  Parliament,  petitioned the  Crown repeatedly for payment of the same amount, complaining that her husband had not received his salary of £3000, whereas Eustace had.\n\nUnlike many of Strafford's political allies, he did not suffer politically as a result of Strafford's impeachment and execution in 1641. Although the \"Old English\" gentry had come to detest Strafford as much as the \"New English\" settlers did,  Eustace was one of their own, and, though he had quarrelled with  Lord Loftus, was generally liked and respected. He remained Speaker of the Commons until 1647; at its final meeting the House voiced its thanks for \"the many good services performed by Sir Maurice Eustace their Speaker\", and spoke ominously of the \"inveterate hatred and malice of the detestable rebels\" against him.\n\nCivil War\nSo long as Dublin remained under Royalist control, Eustace prospered, despite his frequent complaints about the invasion of his property, the despoiling of his woods and the theft of his cattle.  There was also  a bitter  private  feud  between  the \nEustace and Meredyth families, in which there were undoubtedly faults on both sides. The  feud no doubt \nexplains  the  bitter animosity between  Eustace  and  Sir  Robert  Meredyth, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, which reached its height after the Restoration.\n\nHe recovered the old family manor of Palmerstown,   which had passed,  after the Baltinglass branch of the  Eustace family suffered forfeiture of their estates,  to the Allen family. In 1643, being known as a man who had some sympathy for the plight of Irish Roman Catholics, most of whom he thought would lay down their weapons if promised a pardon, he was sent to negotiate with the Irish Confederacy at Kilkenny. He obtained the reversion to the office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and acquired land at Athy and Cong (he was dispossessed of his lands at Cong after the Restoration, much to the amusement of his political opponents). In 1647, however, the Marquis of Ormonde surrendered Dublin to the Parliamentary forces. Eustace was arrested soon afterwards and sent to Chester Castle where he remained for seven years. His confinement cannot have been very strict,  as he formed an extra-marital relationship with a lady (whose name is not known) which produced two children. He and his children's mother, who is said to have been a person of a good family, were still on friendly terms in the 1660s.\n\nOn his release, he returned to Dublin. He was re-arrested, and briefly imprisoned,  on suspicion of corresponding with Charles II,  but was quickly released and allowed to resume practice at the Bar. His loyalty to the Stuart dynasty was never in serious doubt, and it is likely that he was kept under some degree of surveillance. At the same time, he enjoyed the goodwill of Henry Cromwell, who spoke of him as an eminent lawyer  \"to whom I am beholden and owe a kindness\". Precisely what service Eustace had performed for Cromwell is unclear.\n\nRestoration\n\nAt the Restoration, Eustace's unquestioned loyalty to the Crown,  combined with his legal and political experience,  made him on the face of it a man who was ideally suited to high office; in addition, he was personally close to the Duke of Ormonde, who would do anything to help a friend.  Accordingly, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and a Lord Justice of Ireland, exercising the powers of the Lord Lieutenant in his absence, jointly with Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath and Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. He accepted a peerage but later changed his mind, presumably because he had no legitimate son to inherit it.\n\nIronically the only serious objection to his appointment came from Eustace himself. He was increasingly drawn to country life and had looked forward to his retirement to his beloved country seat Harristown Castle,  which he was rebuilding after the damage it had suffered during the Civil War, and which by the time of his death was considered to be one of the finest houses in Ireland. Also he honestly doubted if his age and ill-health fitted him for high office. He wrote pathetically to the Secretary of State:\n\n\"I... am now grown too old to perform any public service. I desire no such post nor any favour except to remain in his Majesty's good opinion. I hope I shall not now be put beyond my strength with any public employment \".\n\nLord Justice of Ireland \nAs Lord Justice, Eustace was embroiled in the bitter disputes (which led to the passing of the Act of Settlement 1662)  between the mainly Roman Catholic Royalists who had been dispossessed in the Cromwellian Settlement of 1652,  and the Parliamentarian newcomers who had bought their estates. Eustace by birth was a member of the dispossessed class and identified himself entirely with its interests; and though he was himself a Protestant he believed firmly in equal rights for Roman Catholics. This put him at odds with his fellow Lords Justices, Mountrath  (until his death at the end of 1661) and Orrery: they were firm supporters of the Cromwellians, whom Eustace regarded as criminals, and in his view, they were both implacably hostile to the Catholics. In his private correspondence with Ormonde, he denounced his fellow Lords Justices with such venom that Ormonde in reply urged him to show more discretion.  He  suffered a  personal \ndefeat when he failed,  despite  strenuous  efforts,   to prevent his  old enemy  Sir  Robert Meredyth  from  being  reappointed Chancellor of the Exchequer,  though he came very close to success. \n\nEustace did obtain some concessions for the Royalists in the Act of Settlement, but the struggle exhausted him and he was thankful when Ormonde's arrival in Dublin in 1662 allowed him to resign as Lord Justice. Always a shrewd man of business, Eustace was careful to get a private Act of the Irish Parliament passed to confirm his right to his estates, except Cong, which the Court of Claims returned to its original Catholic owners, much to the amusement of his enemies, who gleefully pointed to his constant lectures on the rights of Catholic landowners.\n\nLord Chancellor of Ireland \nEustace's prediction that he would be a failure as Lord Chancellor was by general agreement amply fulfilled:   political struggles, physical illness, frequent bouts of depression and family troubles almost incapacitated him in the last years of his life. He was also discouraged by the failure of his well-meant efforts to ensure religious toleration for Roman Catholics: Ormonde, though he was personally tolerant enough in matters of religion,  would give him no support in this, having settled on a policy of simply turning a blind eye to the practice of the Catholic faith in so far as this was possible. He refused to let Eustace permit Catholic barristers to plead in his Court or to be appointed to Commissions for the Peace, and gave him the sensible advice that he should not worry about what he could not change.\n\nIn 1663 Eustace appears to have had a nervous breakdown, which left him completely unable to perform his duties for a time. By this time,   a number of complaints about Eustace's unfitness for office had reached the English Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who had not been consulted about Eustace's appointment, since Ormonde had been given full powers to appoint the Irish judges. Clarendon,  who had an extremely low opinion of Eustace's abilities,  wrote to Ormonde that he should either do the honourable thing by resigning or be dismissed. Ormonde was always loyal, perhaps to a fault, to his old friends:  Elrington Ball remarks that those whom he had ever loved, he would love to the end. He did not defend Eustace's conduct as a judge, but pointed to his long record of loyalty to the English Crown and suggested that dismissal would be a poor reward for it. In the event, it proved very difficult to find a suitable replacement as Chancellor and the question of Eustace's dismissal was still pending when he died. His death did not resolve the problem of finding a suitable replacement, and for the last time it was decided to appoint a senior cleric, Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh, as Lord Chancellor. Ironically Boyle, a non-lawyer, was generally considered to be a better Chancellor than Eustace, as his conscientious devotion to duty made up for his lack of legal training.\n\nHeirs\nEustace had always been an acute man of business,  and despite his professional troubles he continued to prosper financially, recovering most of the Eustace estates forfeited by the Baltinglass branch of the family (some of which he returned to dispossessed Catholic cousins),   and amassing a fortune which was reckoned to be between sixty and eighty thousand pounds (making him a multi-millionaire by modern standards). He owned lands in several counties and did much to improve the town of Baltinglass. He regained the family's Palmerstown estate, and bought lands at Chapelizod, which later became part of Phoenix Park.\n\nHow to dispose of his fortune was a problem which greatly pre-occupied him during his last years. His marriage in 1633 to Cicely (or Charity) Dixon (1606–1678), daughter of Sir Robert Dixon, Lord Mayor of Dublin, was childless. During his years in Chester he had entered a relationship which produced a son (also called Maurice) and a daughter Mary, both of whom he was anxious to provide for, especially as he was still on friendly terms with their mother,  who pressed her son's claim to the inheritance.  Ball, who does not name her, suggests that she was a person of some social standing. Eustace had evidently made a promise to her to leave his lands to their son, which conflicted with his public promise to leave them to his nephew Maurice, the son of his brother William by  Anne Netterville, daughter of Sir Robert Netterville of County Meath.  He consulted the renowned preacher Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down and Connor,  on the ethical question as to whether his pledge to his children's mother was binding: Taylor advised that it was not, but Eustace still wavered. How to balance the claims of his son and his two nephews, Maurice and John  (another son of William),  became almost an obsession with him, to the point where even his loyal friend Ormonde was forced to rebuke him for neglecting official business in favour of his private concerns. His last will divided the property between his nephews, a decision which led to ill-feeling and much further litigation (which was probably \nconnected with a determined effort by one Captain Anglesey to seize possession of Eustace's townhouse).\n\nThe younger Sir Maurice ultimately gained possession of both Harristown and the  Dublin townhouse on Eustace Street.  He sat in the House of Commons for many years but was expelled for non-attendance in 1695.  He returned to Ireland from exile, his brother John having died abroad,  in 1697,  and he, in turn, died in 1703 without surviving male issue. He had married firstly Anne Colville and secondly Clotilda Parsons. His estate was divided between his three surviving daughters, of whom the best-known is the younger Clotilda (1700–1792), \"a clever and excellent woman\",  who married the poet Thomas Tickell, and was the grandmother of the playwright Richard Tickell. Her half-sister Penelope married firstly Robert Echlin (1674-1706)MP,  eldest son of Sir Henry Echlin,  and secondly Edward Stratford, while her half-sister Anne (died 1713) married the Irish MP Benjamin Chetwood, by whom she had several children.\n\nTitle\n\nElrington Ball states that Eustace was offered a peerage shortly after the Restoration. With that habit of dithering which was so marked a feature of his character in his last years, he at first accepted the title Baron Portlester  (commemorating a renowned fifteenth-century member of the Eustace family),  and then changed his mind,  on the ground that there was little point in creating a title which would not pass to either his  natural son or his nephews.\n\nDeath and memorials\nIn 1665 Eustace, though by then he was over seventy years old, appeared to have recovered his physical and mental health. At his niece  Mary's wedding to Richard Dixon (who was apparently a  relative of Maurice's wife)  in the summer,  he was \"as brisk as a bee\". He gave the couple his estate at Calverstown, County Kildare as a wedding gift; it later passed by inheritance to the Borrowes family.  Shortly afterwards however he had a stroke and died. He was buried in a private ceremony the morning after his death at Castlemartin and the Government commemorated his services to the Crown with an official memorial in St. Patrick's Cathedral three weeks later, with a wax effigy taking the place of his corpse. It was rumoured that the official service was designed to counter a story that the private ceremony had been a Catholic one. His widow survived until 1678.\n\nHis name was given to Eustace Street in Dublin city centre, where his townhouse, Damask, stood. No trace of Damask survives today, but it is known to have been one of the largest houses in Dublin, and both the house and the gardens were much admired by Jonathan Swift. Eustace's death led to a dispute in which his heirs had to fight off a determined effort by one \"Captain Anglesey\",  of whom little else is known, to take possession of Damask by force.\n\nReferences\n\n1665 deaths\n1590s births\nPoliticians from County Kildare\nMembers of the Privy Council of Ireland\nPeople of the Irish Confederate Wars\nIrish MPs 1634–1635\nIrish MPs 1639–1649\nSpeakers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801)\nFellows of Trinity College Dublin\nMembers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Kildare constituencies\nSerjeants-at-law (Ireland)", "machine_text": " Maurice Eustace (1581–1665) was an English lawyer, judge, and politician who served as Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) is a museum located in Hobart, Tasmania. The museum was established in 1846, by the Royal Society of Tasmania, the oldest Royal Society outside England. \nThe TMAG receives 400,000 visitors annually.\n\nHistory\nThe museum was officially created in 1848, though the collections it housed were much created earlier. It merged a number of disparate collections, including that of the Royal Society of Tasmania. The Mechanics' Institution of Hobart, Van Diemen's Land Agricultural Society and Van Diemen's Land Scientific Society had each attempted to found a museum earlier than this date, the most successful of these being the Mechanics' Institution, but little record remains of what happened to these efforts.\n\nSir John Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet, during his period was Lt. Governor of Tasmania, did much of the work that led to the modern museum. The museum was noted as first being an established institution in the 1848 minutes of the Royal Society of Tasmania, though Wilmot had done most of the work in 1843 and had attempted to set up a museum in the cottage of the Secretary of the Governor, in what is now the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. In 1838 the Mechanics' Institution received an agreement from the government for a room to be constructed in the Customs House for use as a museum. Customs House was later requisitioned by the Legislative Council of Tasmania and became Parliament House, Hobart. The Royal Society of Tasmania later founded TMAG in the sub-committee room of the Parliament, possibly the same room.\n \nThe museum moved to Harrington St in 1852, where it paid £60 a year in rent for a hall there. In 1853 the governor placed before the Legislative Council a debate on the state granting a plot of land for the building of a permanent museum building. In 1854 the museum attracted over 1000 visitors in a year for the first time. In 1855 the Lady Franklin Museum, founded in 1842 at Acanthe Park (now Lenah Valley), sold its fittings and collection to the Royal Society and these were added to the TMAG. The acquisition was driven by the donation of a large geology collection by Joseph Milligan.\n\nIn 1861 after a number of years, funding was acquired from the state government to construct a museum and the Royal Society hosted an architectural contest. Henry Hunter won and was awarded the contract to design a permanent building for the museum. Henry Young, Governor of Tasmania, laid the cornerstone in that year. The Museum was completed by 1862 and a celebratory art exhibition was hosted by Morton Allport, Henry Hunter and a Captain F. E. Chesney. The art exhibition's objective was to raise money for internal fittings of the building, as the money allocated by the state had only covered construction of the building. In 1884 Alexander Morton, previously Assistant Curator of the Australian Museum, was appointed curator.\n\nIn 1885 the museum was passed from the Royal Society of Tasmania to the a board of trustees under the state government, with a yearly endowment of £500. Until this point it was officially named The Royal Society's Museum. The Royal Society granted the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hobart to the state government at the same time, and they became known as the Tasmanian Museum and Botanical Gardens in that year. Adye Douglas, Premier of Tasmania, was elected Chair of the Board and Alexander Morton was reelected curator and secretary with an annual salary of £200.\n\nIn 1889 a new wing was opened by R Hamilton to extend the museum. In 1890 Betsey Island, then Franklin Island, was granted to the Trustees of the Museum.\n\nIn 1952 the boards of the Botanical Gardens and the Museum were split and the museum assumed its modern name. An act of Parliament was passed to make this so.\n\nGovernance\nIn 1885, TMAG became a Government authority under the control of a Board of Trustees that also controlled the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. By statute, it is now controlled by a Board of Trustees, and is currently part of the Department of State Growth.\n\nAssociated bodies\nTMAG has a number of associated bodies. The Foundation of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery serves as the primary fundraising body for the TMAG. The Friends of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery works to encourage community engagement with the museum, along with its youth-focused counterpart TMAGgots. The Royal Society of Tasmania founded the museum, donating much of its collection, and continues to loan a significant number of pieces.\n\nOther facilities\nIn addition to the main campus, TMAG includes three external sites: a herbarium, a storage and research facility, and the Moonah Workshop.\n\nState collection\nThe museum and art gallery reopened to the public on 15 March 2013, after a four-month closure for redevelopment works.\n\nSee also\n List of museums in Tasmania\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Twitter stream\nTasmanian Museum and Art Gallery YouTube channel\nFlora of Tasmania Online\nTMAGgots website\n\nLandmarks in Hobart\nMuseums in Hobart\n1843 establishments in Australia\nNatural history museums in Australia\nCulture in Hobart\nArt museums and galleries in Australia\nNumismatic museums in Australia\nGovernment agencies of Tasmania\nTasmanian Heritage Register", "machine_text": " Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG), in Hobart, is the second oldest museum in Australia, after the Australian Museum in Sydney. TMAG is located on the historic Queen's Domain, a 15-minute walk from the city centre. The museum's collection comprises cultural and scientific artefacts, specimens and objects, fine and decorative arts, and historic memorabilia. Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery logo Permanent exhibitions The museum's permanent exhibitions include: The Narthex: an exhibition about the history of the museum, the people who have worked there and the collections it has accumulated since it opened in 1842. The Museum Shop: a display of items from the museum's collection of rare and curious artefacts. The Mineral Cabinet: a display of the museum's collection of Tasmanian minerals. The Art Gallery: the museum's collection of Australian and international art, including the \"Peoples' Gallery\", which showcases art from TMAG's extensive collection of Australian colonial art. The Exhibition Hall: a space that houses temporary exhibitions. The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA): a museum located within the TMAG grounds, which houses a collection of ancient and modern art. MONA's main building was purpose-built in 2006, and is also known as the 'Substation Project'. The TMAG grounds also house the Commemorative Stone, the QVMAG Cafe, the QVMAG Gallery and the Royal Society of Tasmania. History The museum was founded in 1842 as the Tasmanian Museum, when a group of naturalists, including Sir John Franklin, the then Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania, decided to establish a museum in the colony. The museum's foundation collection was displayed in the upper room of a nearby chapel, before it was transferred to the current site in 1871. The chapel is now known as the 'Old Chapel', and is the oldest museum building in Australia. The museum was renamed the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 1885, when it became the home of the Royal Society of Tasmania's collection of art and historical items. In the 20th century, the museum's collection was increased by the acquisition of the colonial-era William Crowther Collection and the Australian painter John Glover's collection of colonial paintings, drawings and etchings. In 2005, a new museum, the Museum of Old and New Art, was built within the TMAG grounds. The museum was founded by David Walsh, owner of the MONA vodka company. The museum's crocodile skeleton Collections The museum's collection includes items of cultural and scientific significance, and items of historical interest. Cultural items include the museum's collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material, including artefacts, photographs, historical documents and oral history recordings. Scientific items include a complete skeleton of a Tasmanian tiger, which is the museum's most popular exhibit. Historical items include the museum's collection of items relating to the history of Tasmania, including items associated with the early days of the colony, and items relating to the history of the museum. The museum also holds a collection of fine and decorative arts, including paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, furniture, ceramics, glass, metalwork and textiles.

After the success of No Gentlemen (1881), other books followed, including A Sane Lunatic (1882), Dearly Bought (1884), Next Door (1886), Young Maids and Old (1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (1892). The daughter of George Frederick Root, she wrote the text for several his most successful cantatas. The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's 1903 novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life. Born in Massachusetts, she died at the family home in Maine in 1927.\n\nEarly life and education\nClara Louise Root was born in Newton, Massachusetts, May 25, 1854. She was one of six children, and the oldest daughter of Dr. George Frederick Root, the musical composer, and the former Mary Woodman. Her father, becoming the senior partner of the Chicago firm of Root & Cady, removed with his family to that city when Burnham was very young, and Chicago was her home thereafter. A return for several summers to the old homestead in North Reading, Massachusetts, together with the memory of the first years of her life, gave her an acquaintance with New England dialect and character, which she used later in her work. As a girl, she chiefly pursued music.\n\nCareer\n\nBurnham married while she was still very young. Shortly after her marriage, a brother, who enjoyed reading her letters, urged her to write a story. The brother persisted for months, and at last, in order to show him the absurdity of his request, she began writing. To Burnham's surprise, her attitude soon changed. She wrote two novelettes and paid to have them critiqued by the reader of a publishing house, keeping her identity unknown. The response was unfavorable, the reader going so far as to say that, if the author were of middle age, she would better abandon all hope of success as a writer. Burnham, not being \"of middle age,\" was as reluctant to stop writing as she had previously been to take it up. Recalling her lifelong ability for rhyming, she wrote some poems for children, which were accepted and published by Wide Awake, and that success fixed her determination.\n\nShe wrote No Gentlemen (Chicago, 1881) and offered it to a Chicago publisher. He examined it, said it would be an unsafe first book, and advised her to go home and write another. The author's father, who until that time had not regarded her work seriously, liked No Gentlemen and believed in it. Through his interest, the book immediately found a publisher, and its success was instantaneous. Other books followed including, A Sane Lunatic (Chicago, 1882), Dearly Bought (Chicago, 1884), Next Door (Boston, 1886), Young Maids and Old (Boston, 1888), The Mistress of Beech Knoll (Boston, 1890), and Miss Bagg's Secretary (Boston, 1892). Besides her novels, Burnham wrote the text for several of Root's most successful cantatas, and contributed many poems and stories to \"Youth's Companion,\" \"St. Nicholas \" and \"Wide Awake.\" The 1923 film, A Chapter in Her Life is based on Burnham's novel Jewel: A Chapter in Her Life.\n\nPersonal life\nBurnham had no children and she resided with her father. In addition to her write, she was a cultured pianist. In religion, she affiliated with Christian Scientist. Burnham died at the family home at Casco Bay, Bailey Island, Maine, June 20, 1927.\n\nSelected works\n\n The right princess; a play [in three acts]\n A sane lunatic, 1882\n We, Von Arldens, 1882\n Dearly bought : a novel, 1884\n The waifs' Christmas : a Christmas cantata for children, 1886 (with G.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Heauton Timorumenos\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a village in the countryside of Attica.\n\nCharacters \n Menedemus – an Athenian nobleman, newly moved to the countryside, father of Clinia\n Chremes – Menedemus' neighbour, father of Clitipho\n Clinia – Menedemus' estranged son, in love with Antiphila\n Clitipho – Chremes' son and a friend of Clinia, in love with Bacchis\n Syrus – Clitipho's slave\n Dromo – Clinia's slave\n Antiphila – a girl raised by a weaveress, beloved of Clinia\n Bacchis – a wealthy courtesan, beloved of Clitipho\n Sostrata – Chremes' wife\n Phrygia – Bacchis' slave\n Canthara – a nurse, servant of Sostrata\n\nPlot\n\nPrologue \nThe prologue serves to defend Terence's method of playwriting. He asks the audience to judge the play by its merits, rather than by the opinions of critics.\n\nAct one \nMenedemus, a wealthy farmer, explains to his neighbour Chremes why he is punishing himself by working hard in his fields. Menedemus explains that he had reproached his son Clinia for his having a relationship with a penniless girl, and had held up his own youth as a soldier as a virtuous contrast. Clinia, shamed, has taken Menedemus more literally than he intended and has gone to live as a soldier in the East. By coincidence, immediately after Menedemus exits, Chremes encounters his own son, Clitipho with Clinia, who has returned from the East. Clitipho tells Chremes not to tell Menedemus, as Clinia is still afraid of his father's wrath. Chremes agrees for the moment but adds that a father's duty is to be severe. Once alone, Clitipho swears he will never be a tyrant in the mould of his father.\n\nAct two \nClinia has sent for his lover, Antiphila, who has been in mourning for the old weaving-woman who brought her up. Antiphila arrives accompanied by Bacchis, the wealthy courtesan with whom Clitipho is in love. Clitipho is angered that his slave, Syrus, has presumed to invite his mistress to his father's house, as his father will disapprove of her. Syrus conceives a ruse for the meantime where Bacchis will pose as Clinia's mistress and Antiphila as her servant. The women arrive; Bacchis praises Antiphila for her virtue and beauty but warns that beauty and men's attention fade, and that she ought to find a man to love who will be constant for life. They meet Clinia and the young lovers are overcome with joy at the reunion.\n\nAct three \nChremes informs Menedemus that his son is returned, but believing that Bacchis is Clinia's mistress, he warns Menedemus against welcoming him home, explaining that Clinia is now in love with a spendthrift mistress. He advises Menedemus to wait while Syrus works out a plan. When Menedemus exits, Chremes is surprised to find Clitipho embracing Bacchis, and tells him off. Syrus agrees to help Chremes, but only because it dovetails with his own scheme directed against Chremes: Syrus needs money because he had promised Bacchis money for her part in the deception. Syrus tells Chremes that Antiphila had been pawned to Bacchis by the old weaveress, and Bacchis now wants to sell her, and he advises Chremes to tell Menedemus to buy Antiphila as she is a good bargain: a captive from Caria whose friends will pay handsomely for her release. Chremes thinks it  unlikely that Menedemus will go for this.\n\nAct four \nSostrata, Chremes' wife, has discovered, by way of a ring that Antiphila has given to her for safekeeping while she bathes, that Antiphila is her long-lost daughter whom she had given away to be exposed on Chremes' direction. Syrus realizes that his deception may thus be found out and he may lose the chance to pay off Bacchis, and may be punished. He withdraws to consider a better plan. Clinia, on the other hand, is overjoyed because Antiphila is now revealed to be a suitable wife for him, so he will be able to abandon the deception. But Syrus says that while Clinia may tell his father the truth, he must keep up the pretense to Chremes for a while longer because Clitipho will be in trouble if Chremes discovers that Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress. When Clinia objects that Chremes will not allow him to marry his daughter while he believes Bacchis is Clinia's lover, Syrus persuades him to maintain the ruse for a day to give Syrus the time to get Bacchis' money. Syrus then tells Bacchis, who is threatening to expose him, to go to Menedemus' house where she will get paid. Syrus then tells Chremes the truth as if it is a trick: he tells him that Clinia has told his father that Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress and that he wishes to marry Antiphila. Syrus advises Chremes that he should go along with this 'trick' and offer to give Clinia dowry money, as well as giving Clitipho money to give to Bacchis to pay off her pledge. Meanwhile, Menedemus has been reunited with Clinia, but he then encounters Chremes who tells him that his son is deceiving him with a false declaration that he wishes to marry Antiphila so that he can extract more money for his mistress Bacchis. Menedemus is dismayed and agrees to pretend to believe his son's plan while Chremes engineers a plot to entrap him.\n\nAct five \nFollowing his agreement with Chremes, Menedemus tells his son that his match with Antiphila will go ahead. Chremes is puzzled that Clinia does not respond by trying to extract expenses for the nuptials but then realises that it is he and not Menedemus who is the subject of Syrus' plot. He is in despair as he only has sufficient money to keep up his family for ten days. Menedemus repeats the advice that Chremes gave to him at the start of the play: he should make his son abide by his wishes. Although Chremes approves of the match now between Clinia and Antiphila, because of his financial woe the dowry he can offer is too small. He asks Menedemus to help save his son by pretending that he, Chremes, is giving away all his estate to make a sufficient dowry. Clitipho is distraught when he hears this news, but his father tells him he would rather have his estate be thus disposed of than go to Bacchis by way of his heir. Menedemus upbraids Chremes for treating his son too harshly and Chremes relents, but on the condition that Clitipho give up Bacchis and take a different wife. Clitipho, preferring a full stomach to passion, agrees to marry a respectable girl. In the last lines of the play, Clitipho begs Chremes to reward Syrus for everything he has done for them.\n\nSee also \nQuod licet Iovi, non licet bovi\nLucius Ambivius Turpio\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n English translation by Henry Thomas Riley at Perseus: Heautontimorumenos\n \n \n\nWorks by Terence", "machine_text": " Heauton Timorumenos Heauton Timorumenos (Greek: Χεαυτον Τιμωρηνως, Self-condemned) is a novel by the Greek writer and poet Constantine P.

The work is set in a prison, where the narrator, or perhaps the writer, is serving a sentence for murder. The story is structured as a first-person account of the narrator's life, and the circumstances that led to his imprisonment. The narrator's life is divided into three distinct \"life stories\", each one marked by a specific, significant event. The first life story is the narrator's childhood and youth, and ends with his first murder; the second is the story of the narrator's young adulthood, and ends with his second murder; and the third and final life story is the narrator's old age, and the story ends with the old man's death in prison. The most significant event in the narrator's life is his love for his cousin's wife, and the murder that is committed out of passion. The story is a tragic one, since the narrator is fated to live the rest of his life in prison, and is also a \"self-condemned\" man, because he believes that he is unworthy of happiness.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 16159491}

He composed the jazz and pop standards \"Snowfall\" and \"I Wish I Had You\".\n\nEarly years\nThornhill was the son of J. Chester Thornhill and his wife, Maude. When he was 11 years old, he played piano professionally. While still a youth, he played with two local combos. As a student at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, he played with several theater bands. Thornhill entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music at the age of 16. He also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nCareer\nAs a youth, he was recognized as an extraordinary talent and formed a traveling duo with Danny Polo, a musical prodigy on the clarinet and trumpet from nearby Clinton, Indiana.\n\nHe and clarinetist Artie Shaw started their careers at the Golden Pheasant in Cleveland, Ohio, with the Austin Wylie Orchestra. Thornhill and Shaw went to New York together in 1931. Thornhill went to the West Coast in the late 1930s with the Bob Hope Radio Show and arranged for Judy Garland in Babes in Arms. In 1935, he played on sessions with Glenn Miller, including \"Solo Hop\", which was released on Columbia Records. He also played with Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Billie Holiday. He arranged \"Loch Lomond\" and \"Annie Laurie\" for Maxine Sullivan.\n\nDuring the mid-1930s, Thornhill arranged and played piano for Andre Kostelanetz.\n\nIn 1939, he founded the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Polo was his lead clarinet player. Although the Thornhill band was a sophisticated dance band, it became known for its superior jazz musicians and for Thornhill's and Gil Evans's arrangements. The band played without vibrato, so that the timbres of the instruments could be better appreciated. Thornhill encouraged the musicians to develop cool-sounding tones. The band was popular with both musicians and the public. Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet was modeled in part on Thornhill's sound and unconventional instrumentation. The band's most successful records were \"Snowfall\", \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", and \"Love for Love\".\n\nThornhill was playing at the Paramount Theater in New York for $10,000 a week when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an apprentice seaman on October 26, 1942. As chief musician, he performed shows across the Pacific Theater with Jackie Cooper as his drummer and Dennis Day as his vocalist.\n\nIn 1946, he was discharged from the Navy and reunited his ensemble. Polo, Gerry Mulligan, and Barry Galbraith returned with new members, Red Rodney, Lee Konitz, Joe Shulman, and Bill Barber. Thornhill and his orchestra played for the Judy, Jill and Johnny variety program on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946–1947.\n\nIn 1957, Thornhill became Tony Bennett's musical director. He offered his big band library to Gerry Mulligan when Mulligan formed the Concert Jazz Band, but Mulligan declined the gift, since his instrumentation was different. A large portion of his extensive library of music is currently held by Drury University in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nThornhill died of a heart attack in Caldwell, New Jersey, at the age of 56. In 1984, he was posthumously inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nCompositions \n\nThornhill's compositions included the standard \"Snowfall\", \"I Wish I Had You\", recorded by Billie Holiday and Fats Waller, \"Let's Go\", \"Shore Road\", \"Portrait of a Guinea Farm\", \"Lodge Podge\", \"Rustle of Spring\", \"It's Time for Us to Part\", \"It Was a Lover and His Lass\", \"The Little Red Man\", \"Memory of an Island\", and \"Where Has My Little Dog Gone?\"\n\nCover versions of \"Snowfall\"\nThornhill's 1941 piano composition \"Snowfall\", later had lyrics written by his wife, Ruth Thornhill.

He is best known for his innovative use of voicing and his use of the cool jazz sound, although he also performed traditional bebop, and his music was adaptable to big band arrangements. Thornhill was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to a Canadian mother and an American father. The family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1929. He began studying piano at the age of six, and attended Los Angeles City College from 1942 to 1944, where he studied music. In 1944, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the Pacific Theater of World War II. After the war, Thornhill returned to Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied music under Arnold Schoenberg and Jerry Goldsmith. He played with several jazz bands in Los Angeles, including those of Johnny Otis and Gene Krupa, and recorded with the Ray Noble Orchestra in 1949. He also played with his own small band at various clubs in Los Angeles, and recorded an album for the Los Angeles-based jazz label, Imperial Records. In 1950, Thornhill joined the band of Alvino Rey, and the two of them began a collaboration that would last for several years. The band played at the respective hotels of the Rat Pack's Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, and Thornhill also played with the band at the wedding of Joseph P. Kennedy andJacqueline Bouvier. In 1955, Thornhill and his wife, Barbara, had a daughter, Cristina. Thornhill left Rey in 1957 and formed his own band, which was often billed as \"Claude Thornhill and His Orchestra\". The band's first performance was on January 1, 1958, at the Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica, California, with its first album, A Cloud in His Head, being released in June 1958. The band, which played in a cool jazz style, consisted of about twenty musicians, including five saxophones, four trumpets, three trombones, and a full rhythm section. It released a number of albums on the Dot label, a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, including The Claude Thornhill Sextet, which featured a sextet of the band's musicians. Thornhill's band was one of the few white jazz bands of the period to have a permanent black musician in its ranks: Ralph Glenn, who played second trumpet. Thornhill also hired black musicians as guests, including Lionel Hampton, Percy Faith, and Jimmy Cleveland. The band's music was also distinctive for its use of counterpoint and its unusual voicing, which featured a strong rhythm section and three trumpets. Thornhill's band was one of the few jazz bands to have a full-time arrangement and transcription staff, which was headed by a young Don Sebesky. The band's arrangements were written by Sebesky, Paul Weston, and Thornhill's wife, Barbara. The band's album, The Claude Thornhill Orchestra Plays the Music of Arthur Schwartz, which was released in 1959, was arranged by Sebesky and won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by an Orchestra. In 1961, Thornhill signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, and his band recorded a number of albums for the label, including Great Plains, which featured a collaboration with singer Sue Allen. The band also recorded an album, At the Golden Circle Copenhagen, in Denmark, and played at the White House on several occasions. In the mid-1960s, Thornhill's band was one of the first to experiment with the use of electronic instruments, including the electric piano, the guitar-synthesizer, and the therevox. In 1967, Thornhill retired from performing and began a second career as a composer and conductor of film and television scores. He also composed the theme music for the television series, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. Thornhill died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 70.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 340950}

The Thurstan Holland sign is named after him.\n\nLife\n\nCharles Thurstan Holland was born in March 1863 at Bridgwater, Somerset to William Thomas Holland and his wife Florence Holland (née Florence Du Val), the second daughter of painter Charles Allen Du Val.\n\nHe studied medicine at the University College in London, qualifying in 1888. From October 1896 to 1904 he was honorary radiologist to the Royal Liverpool Hospital and from 1904 to 1923 to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary.\n\nHe started research on Radiology in 1896, after reading about Wilhelm Röntgen's experiments in this field. Thanks to his meticulous work and advancements in his technique, Holland was able to produce radiographs that were far in advance for many years, compared to the standard practice. Along with such names as Heinrich Albers-Schönberg (Germany), Antoine Béclère (France), Etienne Henrard (Belgium), Guido Holzknecht and Robert Kienböck (Austria), Thurstan Holland is considered one of the pioneers in Europe.\n\nHolland took part in the First World War as a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his abilities as radiologist were invaluable in treating patients with bullets lodged in their bodies. By the end of the War, a number of proposals on how to measure the intensity of X-rays had been made, but there was little agreement between the various parties concerned. In 1925 the British Institute of Radiology, under Holland's leadership invited delegates from a number of countries to attend the First International Congress on Radiation in London. This congress set up a framework for future meetings — future congresses would meet every three years in a different country, and be organised by the host country.\n\nThurstan Holland was also a talented photographer, being elected the first President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Photographers' Society.\n\nHe died on 16 January 1941 in Liverpool.\n\nPublications and citations\n\n1890s\nHolland, C.

The Buffalo Springs National Reserve is a popular tourist destination. The reserve offers guided tours, hiking trails, and game drives. The main tourist attraction is the large population of buffalo. The reserve is also home to a variety of other animals, including zebra, wildebeest, and antelope.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"TweenTribune\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "TweenTribune is a free, not-for-profit online newspaper for kids, aged 8–15. It is updated daily with stories from the Associated Press that are chosen based on relevancy to pre-adolescents. Tweens can post comments to the stories which are moderated by their teachers, and teachers can use the site as a resource for meeting No Child Left Behind requirements for reading, writing and computer skills. The site first appeared on Nov 21, 2008.\n\nTweenTribune has been featured in articles in the Los Angeles Times, Good Housekeeping and Family Circle magazine (December 2009).\n\nFinancial model\nTweenTribune.com is a proof-of-concept model for new ways to fund journalism online. The site employs a series of previously untried methods for building audience and revenue. These strategies grew audience and revenue in a matter of weeks, but it remains too soon to tell whether these strategies are the \"silver bullet\" that media companies seek to funding journalism in the digital age.\n\nQuoted on Dec. 15, 2009, James Rainey of the Los Angeles Times said founder Alan Jacobson's \"ebullient innovation opens a door for an underserved audience and provides the kind of incremental revenue that, strand by strand, eventually just might rope journalism back to a financial mooring.\"\n\nBusiness model\nTo achieve sustainability, the site uses a group of strategies to reduce cost:\n\n1. As of January 2010, all content is provided by outside sources. Stories come from the Associated Press, while comments are generated by children in the form of user-generated content (UGC).\n\n2. Editing of comments is provided by teachers, so editing is distributed among users as a means of reducing cost rather than centralizing editing with a paid staff. This is an example of distributive editing (DE).\n\n3. Primary source code is provided by Drupal, a free, open-source code content management system. The site also depends upon other open-source applications, such as Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL.\n\n4. All custom source code was written by Ebizon Netinfo of Noida, India which was more economical than developing the code in the US.\n\nRevenue streams\nFour diversified revenue streams form a previously untested business model for online news:\n\n1. Local and national advertising is targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the content to a youth audience, and geographically, with specific local ads served up based on the IP address of the user. The user's location determines which ads they see.\n\n2. Sponsorships by national advertisers are targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the adjacent news content. Sponsorships can also be targeted topically, on such subjects as Animals, Technology, Fashion, etc.\n\n3. License fees are paid by local media companies for permission to post their local content as a means of promoting their local brands and creating the next generation of news consumers. In addition, local media companies can sell advertising which is targeted geographically. Newspapers using this model include The Valdosta Daily Times, The Traverse City Record-Eagle and the Brainerd Dispatch. Other newspapers using TweenTribune include the Bakersfield Californian, The Virginian-Pilot and the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, VA.\n\n4.\"Freemium\" model, in which basic features are provided to teachers and students at no cost, with specific value-added features that are provided at an additional, nominal cost.\n\nHistory\nAlan Jacobson, president of BrassTacksDesign, created TweenTribune as a way of helping his 10-year-old daughter with her homework.\n\nLaunched on Nov 21, 2008, the site showed little traffic in its first year of existence. But in October 2009 page views began to jump dramatically after a new promotional campaign was launched that marketed the site directly to teachers — a strategy that hadn't been tried before.\n\nBased on traffic recorded in May 2010, the site now has 3.4 million page views per month, and 26,000 teachers are registered. TweenTribune is used in 50,000 classrooms in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Japan.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican news websites", "machine_text": " TweenTribune TweenTribune.com is a free, online newspaper for tweens, by tweens, with news about the world, the United States, and Washington, D.C.

He studied at the University of Salamanca and later at the University of Paris, where he obtained a master's degree in theology. After his studies, he joined the Catholic Church and became a priest. In 1519, Fernández de Valladares was appointed by the Spanish Crown to join the expedition to the East Indies as the spiritual leader of the expedition. He was accompanied by his brother, Juan de Flandes, who was the expedition's chief pilot. The expedition, which was led by Ferdinand Magellan, set sail from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in September 1519 and arrived in the East Indies in April 1520. During the expedition, Fernández de Valladares was responsible for the spiritual welfare of the crew and for the administration of the sacraments. He also played a political role in the expedition, as he was one of the few people who could speak the local languages and had experience in dealing with the local populations. He was also one of the few people who could read and write, and he kept a journal of the expedition's progress. The expedition sailed from the East Indies in June 1522 and arrived in the Kingdom of Spain in September 1522. Fernández de Valladares was one of the few members of the expedition to survive the journey. He returned to the Kingdom of León and lived there for the rest of his life.

The European version also features an earlier recording of \"You're in Trouble\" as a bonus track, believed to feature Joey Cristofanilli on bass guitar. A cover of Rufus Thomas' \"Walkin' the Dog\" is also included, presumably as a nod to the 1973 Aerosmith version. It is also noted for the strong lead guitar presence of guitarist Robbin Crosby, whose trademark \"blues with a twist\" solos are prominent through the first four songs. An early version of \"Tell the World\" (which did not feature Blotzer or Croucier) was also featured on the compilation Metal Massacre, but was removed from later pressings. \"U Got It\" often opened the show circa 1983-84, and Pearcy did the same during his Nitronic 'Pure Hell' Tour in 2000.\n\nIn 1984, Atlantic Records remixed and re-released this EP following the success of Out of the Cellar. This reissue featured a glossier production mix to match the band's recent mainstream success, as well as an updated back cover photo of the group with a more pronounced Sunset Strip glam appearance.\n\nThe legs on the front cover belong to Tawny Kitaen, the then-girlfriend of guitarist Crosby.

The EP's original title was \"Ratt (Special Edition)\", as stated on the back cover of the 1985 re-release, but for unknown reasons, the word \"Special\" was dropped for the 1985 re-release. The EP features three songs and two instrumentals. Two of the songs, \"Ratt\" and \"Lack of Communication\", were re-recorded from their original versions, which can be found on the EP's counterpart, the Ratt (Special Edition) Cassette. The third song, \"She Wants Money\", was re-recorded for the band's first full-length album, Out of the Cellar. The two instrumentals, \"Don't Say I Never Warning\" and \"In Your Dreams\", were recorded during the same sessions as \"She Wants Money\", and were also considered for inclusion on Out of the Cellar, but were left off the final track list. They are both short tracks, each less than two minutes in length. Ratt was recorded at three different studios. The songs were tracked at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California, and the instrumentals were tracked at Impact Sound in Los Angeles, California.

The strip was syndicated by the McClure Syndicate from March 9, 1913, to February 1, 1914.\n\nComics historian Don Markstein traced the history of the characters in his Toonopedia:\nMike & Ike started while Goldberg was in San Francisco, working as sports cartoonist for that city's Bulletin (where he'd replaced another great, Thomas A. \"Tad\" Dorgan, creator of Judge Rummy and his pals). The identical twin morons were originally done as a half-page Sunday series for World Color Printing Co., which later printed most of America's comic books. At the time, it was functioning as both a printer and a syndicate for Sunday comics, distributing Slim Jim, Major Ozone and several others. They didn't have much impact there, but the concept hung around. For years afterward, Goldberg often slipped Mike & Ike panels, in which they played straight man and gag man, onto the ends of his daily comics, keeping them in the public eye. They were well enough known to have starred in the second issue of Comic Monthly (February, 1922) a short-lived magazine that reprinted various King Features offerings, such as Polly and Her Pals in #1 and S'matter, Pop? in #3. Though it didn't use what later became the standard format for comic books, Comic Monthly, which flitted across the publishing scene in a single year, long predated Famous Funnies as America's first periodic comic book. In the late 1920s, Goldberg asserted they were uncles of Boob McNutt, and they became supporting characters in Boob's Sunday page.\n\nFilms\nGoldberg's characters were adapted to film with Dancing Fools, released by Universal Pictures on September 21, 1927. Charles King (as Mike) and Charles Dorety (as Ike) portrayed the duo in eight of the 24 \"Mike & Ike\" comedy shorts. The others starred Joe Young and Ned La Salle. The series ended August 28, 1929 with the release of Good Skates.\n\nCandy\nThe candy company Just Born introduced their Mike and Ike confection in 1940, but it was not a licensed product, as Goldberg's goofy guys were gone by then.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture: Rube Goldberg\nAmerican comics characters\nAmerican comic strips\nAnimated films based on comics\nComic strip duos\nFictional identical twins\nGag-a-day comics\n\n", "machine_text": " Mike and Ike (They Look Alike) \"Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)\" is the second single from the 1984 album, Heart and Soul by the American rhythm and blues band, The Trammps.

Welch attended public schools in Brooklyn, and graduated from high school in 1908. He worked as a messenger for a bank, but was laid off in 1909 due to recession. He was able to secure a position with a wholesale drug company, Johnson & Johnson, where he learned the bottle manufacturing business. In 1911, he founded his own business, the Welch Bottle Company, to manufacture and sell glass bottles to the wine and champagne industries. The company grew to become the largest manufacturer of champagne bottles in the United States. In the early 1920s, Welch's business encountered financial difficulties, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy. As a result, he sold his company to the Crown Cork & Seal Company for $1.5 million. He then began to look for other business opportunities, and soon focused his attention on the emerging market for grape juice. In 1924, he founded the Welch Fruit Company, which initially sold grape juice under the name \"Welch's Vinic\", and soon afterwards began selling a non-alcoholic champagne called \"Methuen champagne\". The company grew rapidly, and in 1928 it was renamed the Welch's Grape Juice Company. Welch was an active philanthropist, and served as a trustee of the John Hopkins University and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. In 1952, he established the Robert S.

He is best known for his work with HIV/AIDS, including his role as a main researcher in the first case of the disease in the United States, his development of the \"Gale-Melarsoprol\" treatment for patients with advanced HIV disease, and his advocacy for the use of zidovudine (AZT) to treat HIV infection in the 1980s. He is also known for his contributions to the field of transfusion medicine, including his work on the development of blood donation policies. Gale is a graduate of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. He completed his residency in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and a fellowship in infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health. He is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine and an adjunct professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health. In 1981, Gale was one of the first physicians to diagnose and report the disease that would come to be known as HIV/AIDS, after a young gay man in his practice was diagnosed with Kaposi's Sarcoma, a rare cancer that was later found to be associated with HIV infection. In the early years of the epidemic, Gale was one of the leading researchers in the field, and he played a major role in the development of the first effective treatments for HIV/AIDS. In the late 1980s, he was a pioneer in the use of zidovudine (AZT) to treat HIV infection, and he played a key role in the development of the \"Gale-Melarsoprol\" treatment for patients with advanced HIV disease. In addition to his work with HIV/AIDS, Gale has also made significant contributions to the field of transfusion medicine, including his work on the development of blood donation policies. He has also conducted research on the transmission of viruses through blood and blood products, and he has been a leading advocate for the use of nucleic acid testing to screen blood donations. Gale has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Arthur L. Carter Award for Excellence in HIV/AIDS Research, the William D. Carey Award for Excellence in Health Policy, and the Distinguished Investigator Award from the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

He played as a wide receiver for the University of Alabama and Baltimore Colts. He later worked as a football coach for 28 years, including stints as the head coach for the New York Giants, the University of Alabama, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Arkansas State University.\n\nEarly life and college career\nPerkins was born in Petal, Mississippi.  He attended The University of Alabama, playing football 1964–1966. He played for coach Bear Bryant and was a teammate of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Namath and Ken Stabler.  The Crimson Tide won national championships in both 1964 and 1965, and Southeastern Conference championships in 1964, 1965, and 1966. During his senior year, he was named team captain. He was also selected as an All-American in 1966.\n\n1964: 11 catches for 139 yards and 1 touchdown.\n1965: 19 catches for 279 yards and 1 touchdown.\n1966: 33 catches for 490 yards and 7 touchdowns.\n\nNFL career\nHe played for the National Football League's Baltimore Colts as a wide receiver from 1967 to 1971, initially under coach Don Shula.  Perkins caught a 68-yard touchdown pass from Johnny Unitas in the 1970 AFC Championship Game to lead the Colts to a 27–17 victory over the Oakland Raiders and a berth in Super Bowl V. Perkins went on to win a Super Bowl ring after the Colts beat the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V.\n\nCoaching career\nPerkins coached in the NFL as an assistant for the New England Patriots (1974–1977) and San Diego Chargers (1978) before becoming head coach of the New York Giants from 1979 to 1982. Although he only had one winning season, he helped build the team that his successor, Bill Parcells, won two Super Bowls with in 1986 and 1990.  Perkins hired future NFL head coaches Parcells, Bill Belichick and Romeo Crennel as young assistants, and was the first NFL coach for future Most Valuable Player and Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor and future Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Phil Simms.\n\nWhen Bryant retired after the 1982 season, Perkins took on the daunting task of succeeding him at Alabama. He coached the Crimson Tide for four years from 1983 to 1986, compiling a record of 32–15–1. However, he went 5–6 in 1984, the school's first losing season since 1957, the year before Bryant's tenure began. Although he won three bowl games during his tenure, it was far short of what Alabama fans had come to expect. Increasing pressure from boosters and alumni at Alabama made Perkins receptive to a lucrative contract offer from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 1986 Alabama season.\n\nPerkins served as head coach and general manager of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1987 to 1990. Some of his former college players got a chance to play for him in the NFL: QB Mike Shula, Kurt Jarvis, and linebacker Keith McCants. His career coaching record in the NFL was 42–75. He never won more than five games in Tampa Bay; his tenure came during an NFL-record streak of 12 consecutive 10-loss seasons. He was fired midway through the 1990 season, and replaced by his offensive coordinator, fellow Alabama alumnus Richard Williamson. Perkins returned to college coaching at Arkansas State University in 1992. After just one year, Perkins became the offensive coordinator of the New England Patriots, serving under Bill Parcells from 1993 to 1996. He also spent 1997 with the Oakland Raiders as an offensive coordinator.  On December 20, 2011, he was introduced as the new head football coach at Jones County Junior College (JCJC) in Ellisville, Mississippi.  Perkins resigned from JCJC on December 24, 2013.  He resided in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In 2014, he was said to be taking a volunteer coaching role with Oak Grove HS.\n\nRecruitment allegations\nIn 1992, former Alabama player Gene Jelks, who had been recruited by Perkins, publicly accused Alabama coaches and boosters of providing him with illegal cash payments and other inducements during his recruitment and years at Alabama (Jelks played from 1985 to 1989).  Jelks's charges resulted in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) investigation of the Alabama football program.  Perkins's former assistant coach Jerry Pullen sued Jelks for slander, but he lost that case and two subsequent appeals, including an appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nDeath\nPerkins died at his home on the morning of December 9, 2020, at 79 years old.\n\nHonors\n SEC Player of the Year, 1966\n First-Team All-American, Split end, 1966\n Inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, Class of 1990\n Inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, Class of 1998\n Elected to the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame in 2005\n\nHead coaching record\n\nCollege\n\nNFL\n\nSee also\n History of the New York Giants (1979–93)\n New England Patriots strategy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1941 births\n2020 deaths\nAmerican football wide receivers\nAlabama Crimson Tide athletic directors\nAlabama Crimson Tide football coaches\nAlabama Crimson Tide football players\nArkansas State Red Wolves football coaches\nBaltimore Colts players\nCleveland Browns coaches\nJones County Bobcats football coaches\nMississippi State Bulldogs football coaches\nNational Football League general managers\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nNew England Patriots coaches\nNew York Giants head coaches\nTampa Bay Buccaneers head coaches\nSan Diego Chargers coaches\nOakland Raiders coaches\nHigh school football coaches in Mississippi\nAll-American college football players\nPeople from Petal, Mississippi\nCoaches of American football from Mississippi\nPlayers of American football from Mississippi", "machine_text": " Ray Perkins (born Ray Gene Perkins; January 20, 1947 – October 24, 2016) was an American football player and coach.

The company mainly produces products for customers to sell under their own brand names. \n\nEach plant, located in the three Iowa towns of West Liberty, Mount Pleasant, as well as Tremonton, Utah, and Bolingbrook, Illinois, focuses on specific aspects of the meat-packing process.  The West Liberty plant participates in the entire process by slaughtering animals, further processing meats into products, and packaging finished products.\n\nInformation\n\nThe company primarily provides meat for other marketing brands, producing 90% of its product for customers while selling only 10% under the West Liberty Foods brand name. In addition to slaughtering turkeys, the company produces prepared beef, chicken, pork, and turkey products.  Company revenue has grown rapidly with US$65 million in sales during 1997, $120 million in 2000, and $200 million in 2003.  Most recently, West Liberty Foods posted $442 million in revenue for 2006, making the company the 56th-largest meat-packing company by sales in the United States.  Much of the company's sales come from large nationwide foodservice customers, and as of 2006, was Subway's largest supplier of sliced sandwich meat, providing the franchise with more than 1 million pounds per week. As a result of servicing national customers, the company is inspected more than other food manufacturers. West Liberty Foods' three plants have been ISO 14001 certified for meeting environmental management standards, and the West Liberty plant was the first turkey-processing plant in the United States to receive this certification.\n\nWest Liberty Foods maintains separate facilities for research and development and laboratory testing services.  They are housed in adjacent buildings several blocks from the plant in West Liberty.  The R&D facility includes testing space for both raw and cooked product, and can create test products from start to finish, including initial formulation, final slicing, and packaging.  The lab conducts product quality testing for the three production facilities and uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for rapid bacteriological testing.  This system can return results within 30 hours of production.\n\nHistory\nPrior to 1996, Louis Rich, the brand name for Oscar Mayer's turkey division, owned the processing plant in West Liberty.  In early 1996, Oscar Mayer's parent company, Kraft Foods, announced that they would close the plant that December if no buyer purchased it.  The Iowa turkey growers who sold to Kraft discussed purchasing the plant to ensure that demand for their birds remained.  In May 1996, 47 of the turkey growers formed the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative (ITGC).  ITGC purchased the plant from Kraft and took control of it in December.  The growers hired meat industry veteran Ken Rutledge to be president and COO of the company. Oscar Mayer helped West Liberty Foods by promising to purchase half of the plant's output in 1997 and a quarter of the output in 1998 to help the startup company.\n\nProduction under ITGC ownership began in January 1997.  The company faced financial difficulty because the turkey market was oversupplied and prices hit historic lows.  While financial projections assumed a price of US$1.92 per pound for turkey, prices averaged $1.46 per pound in 1997. During this time, four of the growers left ITGC.  Turkey prices eventually rebounded, and the company was bolstered by sales to Sara Lee near the end of 1998.\n\nSince the rebound, West Liberty Foods’ sales have grown steadily.  In 2000, the company acquired a second plant in Sigourney, IA, from Pinnacle Foods to meet rising orders. The facility was sold in 2012.  The company grew again in April 2003 when it opened a processing plant in Mount Pleasant, IA, which was later expanded in 2004.  Company leadership changed in 2004 as Ed Garrett was named president and COO when Rutledge resigned to take a position with another growers' organization. In 2006, the company entered into a marketing alliance agreement with Midvale, Utah, based Norbest Foods.\n\nOn April 9, 2020 three workers were infected with COVID-19 at the company's plant in West Liberty, Iowa resulting in a shut down until April 14 due to sanitization being done.\n\nLabor episode\nIn 2004, workers at the West Liberty plant considered joining the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).  On July 1, 2004, the workers voted on whether they would be represented by UFCW Local 431.  An initial tally of votes came out 301 in favor and 299 against union representation.  However, the count did not include 13 ballots which were disputed by UFCW.  The ballots were challenged on claims that they were cast by management personnel who would not be union members.\n\nA National Labor Relations Board hearing to confirm or invalidate the vote was scheduled for January 5, 2005, but then postponed until February 16, 2005.  On February 1, 2005 the company and UFCW settled their dispute.  UFCW withdrew its objections, and West Liberty Foods posted a notice that they would not close the plant or fire workers if employees unionized.  This resulted in a final vote count of 303 to 308 against union representation.\n\nUFCW Local 431 held a second vote at the West Liberty plant on July 15, 2005.  The vote was 231 to 322 against unionization.\n\nIn 2009, the company paid US$58,613.75 to Labor Information Services, an antiunion management services company connected to The Burke Group, to provide consultants who met directly with workers \"either individually or in group meetings...regarding union issues.\"\n\nPlants\n\nWest Liberty plant\nThe West Liberty plant is a  facility which slaughters and further processes turkey products.  The slaughter operation converts around 20,000 turkeys per workday.\n\nLouis H. Rich purchased the West Liberty plant, a former tomato canning facility, in 1943, when he decided to expand the operations of the Rock Island Produce Company, located on 9th Street in Rock Island, Illinois.  The plant was converted to a poultry, including chickens and turkeys, slaughter facility in 1946 and refocused by Rich's sons, Norman and Martin, on turkey in 1949.  The plant was first expanded in 1960.  Oscar Mayer acquired the plant, through its purchase of Louis Rich, Inc., in 1979 and used it for turkey production until selling the plant in 1996.\n\nMount Pleasant plant\nThe Mount Pleasant plant is a  facility that is used for slicing cooked cheese, turkey, chicken, beef, pork, and other products.  The plant employs roughly 500 people working in three shifts.  A  Millard Refrigerated Services facility is located adjacent to the Mount Pleasant plant.  The two facilities are connected, and product is immediately transferred by conveyor from the plant to cold storage when packaging is complete.\n\nThe design and operation of the Mount Pleasant plant was developed to decrease potential hazards to food safety.  WLF representatives have stated that the goal of the Mount Pleasant plant is to create a pathogen-free environment.  Because company officials believe that the food safety aspects of the plant are unique in the meat industry, they submitted the plant design for patent approval through the U.S. Patent Office. The Mount Pleasant plant is located about  from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants.  This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready-to-eat production.\n\nThe Mount Pleasant facility consists of approximately 20 individual processing cells that are separated from one another and are set up so that they could operate as individual meat slicing facilities.  Before antimicrobial flooring was poured, the cells were erected with stainless steel antimicrobial walls that are built into the floor.  Each processing cell has independent refrigeration and drainage systems.  The refrigeration systems filter the cell's air and maintain positive air pressure at , and the drainage systems are sealed off and flooded with sanitizers nightly.\n\nDuring operation, fully cooked meat or cheese logs arrive sealed in impermeable casings.  The logs go through a casing sanitation step that involves being treated with a sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from the logs.  The logs then undergo a postlethality treatment by passing through an infrared pasteurization tunnel to kill pathogens on the logs.  The logs are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell.  The mechanical transfers decrease the risk of product contamination by reducing handling of product by personnel .\n\nFood safety is a factor in hiring employees at the Mount Pleasant facility.  Before applying, potential employees must complete a 16-hour food-safety training course through Iowa State University.  The class includes written tests which each applicant must pass before completing the course.  On the job, employees must don a sealed clean room suit before entering slicing cells.  The suits are cleaned and sealed in a clean room laundry facility in North Carolina by the uniform company Cintas.  Employees replace the clean suit each time they leave the cell so each employee averages five suits per day.\n\nTremonton, Utah, plant\nAs of 2006, West Liberty Foods plans to build a plant in Tremonton, Utah.  The plant will not slaughter, but the  facility will allot  for processing and  for slicing a variety of meat products.  The company broke ground for the facility in October 2006. It is expected to begin production in July 2007.  When completed, the plant will be the first in North America to slice  slicing logs. The plant will initially have ten slicing cells allowing production of 150 million pounds per year and will eventually add ten more cells to double the plant's capacity. At full capacity, the plant will employ more than 500 people. Similar to the Mount Pleasant plant, a  Millard Refrigerated Services facility will be built adjacent to the Tremonton plant for warehouse storage of refrigerated and frozen products.\n\nInitially, the company investigated sites for the new plant in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.  It requested US$5.2 million in tax incentives from Utah to build in Pleasant View, Utah.  On April 26, 2006 Utah's Department of Community and Economic Development approved a US$2 million tax-rebate over 10 years.  The incentives were conditioned on the new jobs paying a certain level above the county median wage, offering health insurance, and the company staying in Utah for 10 years.  Pleasant View offered another US$1.4-US$1.8 million in incentives.  However, construction in Pleasant View became impossible when it was discovered that much of the site consisted of wetland areas.  After this development, the state held the incentive offer open provided that West Liberty Foods could find another suitable site that met Utah's requirements.\n\nOn July 29, 2006, the company announced that they would build the new plant in Tremonton, Utah.  The tax incentives will total an 80% property tax break, but Tremonton is projected to experience a US$508 thousand financial benefit over 12 years after the plant is completed.  Of the 500 jobs at the plant, 300 are expected to pay between US$21,500 and US$26,875. The rest of the jobs will pay more with about 100 paying around US$37,000.\n\nBolingbrook, Illinois, plant \nWest Liberty Foods opened its plant in Bolingbrook, Illinois, plant in 2014.

The border control counted more than 950,000 border crossings in 2004.\nIn April 2007, the construction of a  paved road from Choir to Zamyn-Üüd via Sainshand began. Completion is planned for October 2007. However, completion of the road project was pushed back to 2013, with Sainshand to Choir section being finished in September, 2013. A new expanded road border crossing was also completed in 2013 to relieve delays in crossing from China to Mongolia.\n\nThe \"Zamyn-Uud\" Free Economic Zone was officially created in 2004. It has an area of 900 ha and is located between Zamyn-Üüd settlement and the Chinese border.\n\nClimate\nZamyn-Üüd has a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWk) with very warm summers and very cold winters. Most precipitation falls in the summer as rain, with some snow in the adjacent months of May and September.

The area of the district is 6,000 square kilometers (2,320 square miles). The population of the district is 119,100 (1 January 2020 estimate). Zamyn-Üüd is a transportation hub. The M39 highway from Moscow to Termez, Uzbekistan, passes through the town. The railway from Moscow to Termez also passes through the town. In Soviet times, Zamyn-Üüd was a town of military significance, due to its location on the Soviet border with Afghanistan. There was a Soviet Army base in the town. Zamyn-Üüd has an altitude of 425 meters (1,394 feet) above sea level. The climate is dry, with hot summers and cold winters. Zamyn-Üüd is located in a region where two cultures, Iranian and Turkic, meet. The influence of the Iranian culture is visible in the architecture of the town, in the local language and in the names of the streets. The influence of the Turkic culture is visible in the local cuisine. In Soviet times, Zamyn-Üüd was a closed town, which meant that only people with special permission could enter or leave it.

The species is known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington State, United States.  The species was first described from fossil leaves found in the Klondike Mountain Formation.  R. garwellii likely hybridized with the other Klondike Mountain formation sumac species R. boothillensis, R. malloryi, and R. republicensis.\n\nDistribution and paleoenvironment\nRhus garwellii is known from specimens which are recovered from an outcrop of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic.  The Klondike Mountain Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more mesothermal in nature.  The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer–broadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm.  Fossils of Rhus garwellii were described along with descriptions of the coeval species R. boothillensis and R. republicensis plus a redescription of R. malloryi.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was described from a type specimen, the holotype leaf, number SR 00-04-24, plus two paratype specimens SR 93-14-02 and SR 07-39-05 A & B.  The type series specimens are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the Stonerose Interpretive Center in Republic, Washington.  The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Soon Flynn and Kathleen Pigg of Arizona State University with Melanie DeVore of Georgia College and State University. They published their 2019 type description for R. boothillensis in the International Journal of Plant Sciences.  The etymology of the chosen specific name garwellii is a patronym honoring Gar Rothwell recognizing his excitement and dedication for paleobotany.  In addition to Rhus garwellii Flynn et al also provided descriptions of the coeval species R. boothillensis and R. republicensis and a gave a redescription of R. malloryi in the 2019 paper.  They noted that the Klondike Mountain Formation preserves a number of Rhus specimens which appear to be hybrids of the named species.\n\nDescription\nFull R. garwellii pinnately compound leaves are unknown, with the leaflets being found without a petiole or rachis having been found at the time of description.  Unlike R. malloryi and R. republicensis which both have sessile leaflets, R. garwell and R. boothillensis leaflets have petiolules.  The  R. garwell leaflets are elliptical in outline, tapering from the wide middle to the symmetrical base and pointed apex.  They have a width of  and a length to width ratio of up to 2.6:1. The teeth along the margin have distinctly pointed tips with convex basal and apical sides running towards angular sinuses.\n\nThe midveins of the leaflets are thicker at the base and narrow from base to the leaflet apex, with smaller secondary veins branching off the midvein at acute angles.  The secondaries are branch from the midvein subopposite to alternately, with frequent intersecondary veins between them that branch into tetiaries.  The secondaries curved towards the leaflet edges, with a major fork between 40%–60% from the midvein.  The secondary veins major branch terminate in a tooth, while the minor branch terminates in the sinus above or below a tooth.  The tertiary veins are sinuous and connect to either the secondary veins or to the midvein.\n\nReferences\n\n†garwellii\nPrehistoric angiosperms\nPlants described in 2019\nYpresian plants of North America\nExtinct flora of North America\nFossil taxa described in 2019\nKlondike Mountain Formation", "machine_text": " Rhus garwellii, known by the common names Garwell's sumac and Sierra sumac, is a species of sumac in the family Anacardiaceae.

It has a maximum altitude of 1,834 m above sea level. Its name derives from the rock type Nagelfluh. In older and geological literature, as well as in the local vernacular language, one also finds the term Hochgratkette.\n\nThe geotope Nagelfluhkette is the most extensive object of the Nagelfluhkette Nature Park, which was established on 1 January 2008.\n\nLocation \nThe Nagelfluhkette extends throughout the western part of the Allgäu Alps west of the Illertal, in which the Bavarian cities Sonthofen and Immenstadt lie. Between these cities is Blaichach, from where the mountain range stretches for about 20 km in west-southwest direction to the Vorarlberg community of Hittisau. The German-Austrian border runs along the saddle of the mountain ridge between Hohenfluhalpkopf and Hochhäderich (Hoher Häderich).\n\nThe Nagelfluhkette is one of the last higher elevations of the Alps before further north the Alpine foothills of the Allgäu begin. In the north lies the valley of the west-flowing Weißach; in the southeast the Hörnergruppe rises beyond the valley of the northeast-flowing Aubach.\n\nNagelfluhkette Nature Park \nThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park is the first cross-border nature park to be created between Germany and Austria, thus representing an international natural protection pilot project. It also constitutes the first natural park in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nPriority objectives are the protection, care and development of nature and the diverse landscapes. Nature parks are relatively weak protection instruments, which primarily serve to harmonize the interests of nature conservation and local tourism. This part is located primarily in parts of the Bavarian Forest which are still in use, and not in the well-developed alpine area. In Vorarlberg – unlike in the other federal states of Austria – a nature park is not a legally protected area. The Nagefluhkette Nature Park is a voluntary commitment of the nature park communities themselves. Therefore, the park is (as of 5/2011) not a member of the Association of Nature Parks of Austria (VNÖ).\n\nSize and participating communities \n\nThe Nagelfluhkette Nature Park covers 24,700 hectares in the district of Oberallgäu and 16,300 hectares in the adjacent Bregenzerwald, making a total of about 410 square kilometers. Six Oberallgäu communities and eight Vorarlberg communities joined forces for this project:\n\n Germany: Balderschwang, Blaichach, Bolsterlang, Fischen, Immenstadt, Oberstaufen, Obermaiselstein\n Austria: Doren, Hittisau, Krumbach, Langenegg, Lingenau, Riefensberg, Sibratsgfäll, Sulzberg\n\nAdministration \n\nThe nature park administration (\"Naturpark Nagelfluhkette e.V.\") is based in Bühl am Alpsee, a district of Immenstadt. On the Austrian side, the park is looked after in the community offices.\n\nTourism \nThe Nagelfluhkette is flanked by lower mountain ridges to the north and south and thus offers excellent views in almost all directions. Mountain railways are operated all year round in Mittagberg (Mittagbahn) and Hochgrat (Hochgratbahn).\n\nHiking \n\nHikes on the Kammweg chain are of the most popular in the district of Oberallgäu, thanks to the glorious views. Since all mountains are individually accessible, there is a great variety of secure walks, with only a minimum of  climbing obstacles. Some places, especially between Steineberg and Stuiben, and between Falken and Hochhädrich, are difficult and exposed, requiring a high degree of sure-footedness and a head for heights.\n\nShorter routes lead, for example, from the mountain station of the Mittagbahn over the Steineberg and Stuiben through the Steigbachtal back to Immenstadt. Another trail is the Maximiliansweg, which leads over the mountains Hochgrat, Rindalphorn, and Buralpkopf.\n\nWell-secured and -signposted medium-length tours include the crossing of the entire eastern chain from Hochgrat to the Mittag (Nagelfluh-Gratwanderung), which follows the European long-distance hiking trails E4 and E5 at this stage, and the crossing of the western chain between Hochgrat and Falken (Luftiger Grat).\n\nThe Königstour, an entire crossing of the Nagelfluh from Mittagberg to Hochhädrich, is doable on a single day, provided the hiker is sportive and fit (length of the tour: about 8.5 hours, including breaks). In any case, the Staufner Haus of the German Alpine Club is available as an accommodation hut.\n\nWinter sports \n\nIn addition to the mountain railways, there are ski lifts to the Einguntkopf (from Falkenhütte) and Hochhädrich, each on the snow-sure north side.\n\nSlopes for skiers are located at Mittagberg, Hochgrat, Einguntkopf and Hochhädrich in Austria. Large parts of the Nagelfluh crossing are accessible as winter hikes with snowshoes or touring skis.\n\nMountains \nThe highest mountain of the Nagelfluhkette is the Hochgrat with a height of 1,834 m.\n\nExternal links \n\n Website of the Nature Park Nagelfluhkette\n\nReferences \n\nMountain ranges of Vorarlberg\nMountain ranges of Bavaria", "machine_text": " The Nagelfluhkette is a mountain range in the Northern Limestone Alps of Germany and Austria. The range is located in the state of Bavaria in Germany and the state of Tyrol in Austria. It is a small range, about 65 km (40 mi) long and no more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide. The highest peak is the Hohe Große Lindau at 8,208 ft (2,500 m). The range is named after the German word for \"nail,\" nagel, which describes the shape of the mountains, as they appear \"clipped\" along their tops. The northern part of the range is in Germany, the southern part is in Austria. The border between the two countries runs along the main crest of the range. The Nagelfluhkette is part of the Northern Limestone Alps. To the north it is bounded by the Allgäu Alps and to the south it is bounded by the Karwendel. To the east the Tannheim Mountains and the Oberallgäu Alps are the adjacent ranges. The main ridge of the Nagelfluhkette, which is the watershed between the Bavarian and Tyrolean parts of the range, consists of the following peaks: The prominent rock formation calledü, located between the Vennacher Heft and the Hohe Große Lindau, is the highest point of the Bavarian part of the range at 7,(), and the second highest point of the range. To the south of the main ridge the mountains are higher and become more rugged. The highest mountains of the southern part are: The Nagelfluhkette is drained by the Iller and the Isar in the west and by the Inn in the east. The Iller originates in the Allgäu Alps and flows through the valley between the Nagelfluhkette and the Allgäu Alps. It flows into the Isar in the west. The Isar originates in the Karwendel and flows through the valley between the Nagelfluhkette and the Karwendel. It flows into the Danube in the south. The Inn originates in the Austrian Inn Valley to the east of the range and flows past the eastern end of the range. It flows into the Danube north of the city of Munich. There are two large lakes in the range, the Weißensee and the Tegernsee. The Weißensee is located in the Austrian part of the range. It is drained by the Weißenbach, a tributary of the Inn. The Tegernsee is located in the Bavarian part of the range. It is drained by the Fünfseenbach, a tributary of the Isar. The Nagelfluhkette is a popular destination for hiking and rock climbing. The Weißensee and the Tegernsee are both well-known resorts. There are two via ferratas in the range. One of them is the via ferrata up to the top of the Vennacher Heft. The other one is the via ferrata over the Reiter Alm, a via ferrata which is only accessible by climbing. There are three dams in the range. The most prominent one is the Walchensee, a large reservoir which is located in the Isar valley to the west of the range. The other two are the Weisseisensee and the Tegernsee. Both are located in the Bavarian part of the range.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 58240447}

She was the only child of Agnes de Lima, a writer on education, and Andrew Lang. She grew up in New York City, Mexico, and Palo Alto, California. She received her B. A. from Barnard College in 1942 and her M. S. in Journalism from Columbia University in 1944. After college, she worked for the United Press and as a freelance journalist until she began writing fiction full-time in 1948, studying in Hiram Hadyn's writer's workshop at the New School of Social Research.\n\nHer first novel, The Captain's Beach, was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1950, and told the story of the residents of a rooming house near New York City's waterfront. Although Nelson Algren called it, \"a very real achievement in tenderness, in understanding, and in earnestness,\" the New Yorker's reviewer considered the writing \"painfully studied and even windy.\" Looking back at the novel nearly 50 years later, in her obituary in the Independent, Christopher Hawtree described it as \"the work of somebody who, simultaneously, can write and yet can't.\"\n\nHer second novel, The Swift Cloud (Scribners, 1952), was about a man falsely accused of murdering his mentally retarded son. She was awarded the 1953 Prix de Rome fellowship in literature and studied at the American Academy in Rome, where she met and married Stephen Greene, an American artist. They returned to the U. S. in 1954.\n\nCarnival by the Sea (Scribners, 1954), was described in The New York Times as \"the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the gaudy hell of a modern amusement park.\" Doris Grumbach, reviewing the book for Commonweal, wrote that it \"is strong enough to use what it must and impress the whole with an originality and force of its own.\"\n\nPraise a Fine Day (Random House, 1959) drew upon the experiences of de Lima and her husband in Rome. Told in the voice of a nameless American artist in his early thirties living in New York City, it recalls how he agreed to an arranged marriage with the stateless and pregnant Polish mistress of a wealthy Egyptian Jew to give American citizenship to their unborn child. Entering into the deception for purely financial reasons, he falls in love with the woman but ultimately finds himself abandoned and wondering whether anything he knew about the situation was true. The book received de Lima's best reviews. Edmund Fuller proclaimed her \"one of the most deft, accomplished stylists among our younger writers,\" and Granville Hicks wrote that she had \"a delicate style that matches her insights.\" In his Independent obituary, Christopher Hawtree called in a \"small masterpiece\": \"the 150 pages take in all manner of manipulation, evil, passion and illicit congress: it could surely have been the basis for one of the era's great movies....\"\n\nHer fifth novel, Oriane (Harcourt, Brace & World, 1968) received few reviews and those were less than enthusiastic. The reception so disappointed de Lima that she gave up writing completely. \"It broke her heart,\" said Greene.\n\nShe died of a stroke in Nyack, New York, on 19 September 1999. Her daughter, Alison de Lima Greene, is a curator at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and has published a number of works on modern art.\n\nBibliography\nNovels:\n The Captain's Beach (1950)\n The Swift Cloud (1952) (published in paperback as A Mask of Guilt)\n Carnival by the Sea (1954)\n Praise a Fine Day (1959)\n Oriane (1968)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Review of \"Praise a Fine Day\" at The Neglected Books Page, retrieved 2010-07-24\n\n1921 births\n1999 deaths\n20th-century American novelists\nWriters from New York City\nBarnard College alumni\nColumbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni\nAmerican women novelists\n20th-century American women writers\nNovelists from New York (state)\nAmerican expatriates in Mexico", "machine_text": " Sigrid de Lima (born 8 May 1973) is a Brazilian actress.

It was produced by George T.Goodman for Paramount Pictures. The film also features Barbara Nichols, Lee Patrick, and Ray Walston. The film is based on the 1953 novel by Hal Southwell, The Longest Night, which was a rewrite of his own novel, The Whirlwind. Southwell's novel was in turn based on a real-life news story that he had heard about, about a man who escaped from a mental institution on April 1. The film was shot in Paramount's own studio in Los Angeles. The film's art director was Hal Perdoner. The film was released in April 1954. The film was entered into the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. The film was remade in 2008, starring Michael Douglas and Ashton Kutcher. Plot On April 1, a man is shot while running across a field. Hestaggers into a police station and dies. The police initially assume it was an accident, but the man's brother, Fred Amiel, insists that it was murder, and that the killer is \"collecting signatures\". Amiel's brother was the latest in a series of recent deaths, all of which were apparently accidental, but all of which had a similar MO. In each case, the \"victim\" was running, and was shot in the back. The police, led by Captain Moxley, are skeptical of Amiel's claim, especially after he produces a list of future victims, with April 1, 1954, being the next date on the list. As a result, the police set out to find the killer before he can strike again. In the process, they discover a pattern: all of the victims were involved in a car accident, and all of them had recently visited a certain garage. The police suspect the owner of the garage, a man named Harbin, but he proves to be a dead end. Still, the police feel that they are getting closer to the truth, and they increase their surveillance of potential victims. One of these victims is a woman named Julie, who lives with her roommate, Thelma. The police stake out the apartment, and manage to catch the killer in the act of making his escape. It turns out that the \"killer\" was Thelma, who had been trying to make Julie's life more interesting. It is then revealed that Fred Amiel was the killer, and that the entire story was an April Fools' joke. The real killer, a man named Reynolds, was accidentally shot by Amiel during a struggle. Reynolds, who was dressed as a police officer at the time, was trying to frame Amiel. Amiel is taken to the police station, where he confesses to the murders. However, as he is being taken to the jail, he escapes and runs across a field. He is shot in the back and killed by one of the police officers.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Bush Doctrine\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Bush Doctrine refers to multiple interrelated foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. These principles include unilateralism and the use of preemptive war.\n\nCharles Krauthammer first used the phrase in June 2001 to describe the Bush administration's \"unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol.\" After the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.\n\nDifferent pundits have attributed different meanings to the Bush Doctrine. It was used to describe specific policy elements, including a strategy of \"preemptive strikes\" as a defense against an immediate or perceived future threat to the security of the United States. This policy principle was applied particularly in the Middle East to counter international terrorist organizations and to justify the invasion of Iraq.\n\nGenerally, the Bush Doctrine was used to indicate a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. economic interests. Some of these policies were codified in a National Security Council text entitled the National Security Strategy of the United States published on September 20, 2002.\n\nThe phrase \"Bush Doctrine\" was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, \"If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.\"\n\nNational Security Strategy of the United States\nThe main elements of the Bush Doctrine were delineated in a document, the National Security Strategy of the United States, published on September 17, 2002. This document is often cited as the definitive statement of the doctrine. As updated in 2006, it states:\n\nComponents\nThe Bush Doctrine is defined as \"a collection of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy.\" Some of these had reemerged from the 1992 draft Wolfowitz Doctrine, which had been leaked and disavowed by the first Bush administration; Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, was at the center of the new Bush administration's strategic planning. Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: 1.) preemptive strikes against potential enemies and 2.) promoting democratic regime change.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration claimed that the US was locked in a global war; a war of ideology, in which its enemies are bound together by a common ideology and a common hatred of democracy.\n\nOut of the National Security Strategy, four main points are highlighted as the core to the Bush Doctrine: 1.) Preemption, 2.) Military Primacy, 3.) New Multilateralism, and 4.) the Spread of Democracy.  The document emphasized preemption, stating, \"America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few\", and required \"defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld remarked thus in 2006, in a statement taken to reflect his view of the Doctrine's efficacy: \"If I were rating, I would say we probably deserve a D or D+ as a country as how well we're doing in the battle of ideas that's taking place. I'm not going to suggest that it's easy, but we have not found the formula as a country.\"\n\nIn his 2010 memoir Decision Points, President Bush articulates his discrete concept of the Bush Doctrine. He stated that his doctrine consisted of four \"prongs\", three of them practical, and one idealistic. They are the following: (In his words)\n \"Make no distinction between terrorists and the nations that harbor them — and hold both to account.\"\n \"Take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home.\"\n \"Confront threats before they fully materialize.\"\n \"Advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy's ideology of repression and fear.\"\n\nUnilateralism\nUnilateral elements were evident early in Bush's presidency. Conservative Charles Krauthammer, who coined the term \"Bush Doctrine\", deployed \"unilateralism\", in February 2001 to refer to Bush's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding his decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty.\n\nThere is some evidence that Bush's willingness for the US to act unilaterally came even earlier. The International Journal of Peace Studies 2003 article \"The Bush administration's image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity\" states:\n\nAttacking countries that harbor terrorists\n\nThe doctrine was developed more fully as an executive branch response following the September 11 attacks. The attacks presented a foreign policy challenge, since it was not Afghanistan that had initiated the attacks, and there was no evidence that they had any foreknowledge of them. In an address to the nation on the evening of September 11, Bush stated his resolution of the issue by declaring that, \"We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.\" The President made an even more aggressive restatement of this principle in his September 20, 2001 address to a Joint Session of Congress:\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer later wrote in an autobiographical account of that address, \"In a speech hailed by the press and by Democrats, [the President] announced what became known as the 'Bush Doctrine'\".  The first published reference after the 9/11 attacks to the terror-fighting doctrine appeared September 30 in an op-ed by political scientist Neal Coates.\n\nThis policy was used to justify the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and has since been applied to American military action against Al Qaeda camps in North-West Pakistan.\n\nPre-emptive strikes\nBush addressed the cadets at the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) on June 1, 2002, and made clear the role pre-emptive war would play in the future of American foreign policy and national defense:\n\nThe stance of the Bush administration was that the harsh measures to spread the democracy worldwide are inevitable and efficacious, in which for instance, liberating Iraq will plant democracy in the area and enable it to flourish in the rest of the Middle East.\n\nTwo distinct schools of thought arose in the Bush administration regarding how to handle countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea (the so-called \"Axis of Evil\" states). Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, as well as U.S. Department of State specialists, argued for what was essentially the continuation of existing U.S. foreign policy. These policies, developed after the Cold War, sought to establish a multilateral consensus for action (which would likely take the form of increasingly harsh sanctions against the problem states, summarized as the policy of containment). The opposing view, argued by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and a number of influential Department of Defense policy makers like Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, held that direct and unilateral action was both possible and justified and that America should embrace the opportunities for democracy and security offered by its position as sole remaining superpower.\n\nDemocratic regime change\nIn several speeches between late 2001 and 2002, Bush expanded on his view of the US foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the US should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the nation had to act unilaterally in its own security interests, without approval of international bodies like the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.\n\nIn his 2003 State of the Union Address, Bush declared:\n\nAfter his second inauguration, in a January 2006 speech at National Defense University, Bush said: \"The defense of freedom requires the advance of freedom.\"\n\nNeoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine held that the hatred for the West and the United States particularly exists not because of actions perpetrated by the US, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of the US use terrorism as a war of ideology against the nation. The responsibility of the US is to protect itself by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities. The Elections in Egypt, Lebnon and Palestine are happened as a result of this initiative in the sense that Brotherhood, Hezbollah and Hamas were allowed participate in it.\n\nInfluences on the Bush Doctrine\n\nNeoconservatives\nThe development of the doctrine was influenced by neoconservative ideology, and it was considered to be a step from the political realism of the Reagan Doctrine. The Reagan Doctrine was considered key to American foreign policy until the end of the Cold War, just before Bill Clinton became president of the United States. The Reagan Doctrine was considered anti-Communist and in opposition to Soviet Union global influence, but later spoke of a peace dividend towards the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. The Reagan Doctrine was strongly criticized  by the neoconservatives, who also became disgruntled with the outcome of the Gulf War and United States foreign policy under Bill Clinton, sparking them to call for change towards global stability through their support for active intervention and the democratic peace theory. Several central persons in the counsel to the George W. Bush administration considered themselves to be neoconservatives or strongly support their foreign policy ideas.\n\nNeoconservatives are widely known to long have supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and on January 26, 1998, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) sent a public letter to then-President Bill Clinton stating:\n\nAmong the signatories to PNAC's original statement of Principals is George H. W. Bush's Vice President Dan Quayle, George W. Bush's defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, his deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, his Vice President Dick Cheney, and his brother Jeb Bush.\n\nPNAC member and the chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee (DPBAC), Neoconservative Richard Perle, later expressed regret over the Iraq invasion and ultimately put the blame for the invasion on President George W. Bush.\n\nOther Bush cabinet members who are thought to have adopted neoconservative foreign policy thinking include Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThe Bush Doctrine, in line with long-standing neoconservative ideas, held that the United States is entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the United States must take responsibility for security and show leadership in the world by actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.\n\nThe Bush Doctrine, and neoconservative reasoning, held that containment of the enemy as under the realpolitik of Reagan did not work, and that the enemy of United States must be destroyed pre-emptively before they attack—using all the United States' available means, resources and influences to do so.\n\nOn the book Winning the War on Terror Dr. James Forest, U.S. Military Academy Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, comments: \"While the West faces uncertainties in the struggle against militant Islam's armies of darkness, and while it is true that we do not yet know precisely how it will end, what has become abundantly clear is that the world will succeed in defeating militant Islam because of the West's flexible, democratic institutions and its all-encompassing ideology of freedom.\"\n\nNatan Sharansky\n\nAnother part of the intellectual underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book The Case for Democracy, written by Israeli politician and author Natan Sharansky and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States Ron Dermer, which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking. The book argues that replacing dictatorships with democratic governments is both morally justified, since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.\n\nExpanding United States influence\nPrinceton University research fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 International Security journal article \"The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy\", attributed the Bush administration's activist democracy promotion to two main factors: the expansion of material capabilities, and the presence of a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that the Bush Doctrine promotion of democracy abroad was held as vital by the Bush administration to the success of the United States in the \"war on terror\". It was also a key objective of the administration's grand strategy of expanding the political and economic influence of the United States internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: \"exemplarism\", or leadership by example, and \"vindicationism\", or the direct application of United States power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of the Bush administration.\n\nCriticism and analysis\nThe Bush Doctrine resulted in criticism and controversy.  Peter D. Feaver, who worked on the Bush national security strategy as a staff member on the National Security Council, said he has counted as many as seven distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the United States, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the \"Bush Doctrine\", demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. \"I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine\", said Philip D. Zelikow, who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \"Indeed, I believe the assertion that there is such a doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration's policies than they deserve.\" Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said he thought there was no \"single piece of paper\" that represents the Bush Doctrine.\n\nExperts on geopolitical strategy note that Halford Mackinder's theories in \"The Geographical Pivot of History\" about the \"Heartland\" and world resource control are still as valid today as when they were formulated.\n\nIn his 2007 book In the Defense of the Bush Doctrine, Robert G. Kaufman wrote: \"No one grasped the logics or implications of this transformation better than Halford Mackinder. His prescient theories, first set forth in Geographical Pivot of History, published in 1904, have rightly shaped American grand strategy since World War II. Mackinder warned that any single power dominating Eurasia, \"the World Island\", as he called it, would have the potential to dominate the world, including the United States.\" Kaufman is a political scientist, public policy professor and member of The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee. He said in an interview about the book: \"I wrote this book because of my conviction that the Bush Doctrine has a more compelling logic and historical pedigree than people realize.\"\n\nThe Bush Doctrine was polarizing both domestically and internationally. In 2008, polls showed there was more anti-Americanism than before the Bush administration formed the Bush Doctrine; this increase was probably, at least partially, a result of implementing the Bush Doctrine and conservative foreign policy.\n\nForeign interventionism\n\nThe foreign policy of the Bush Doctrine was subject to controversy both in the United States and internationally.\n\nJohn J. Mearsheimer argues in his book, The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities that a liberal hegemonic policy like the Bush Doctrine is ineffective at achieving its stated end goals and is doomed to lead to more war, anti-Americanism, and a global retreat in democracy.\n\nSome critics of the policies were suspicious of the increasing willingness of the United States to use military force unilaterally.\n\nRobert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson argued that it reflects a turn away from international law, and marks the end of American legitimacy in foreign affairs.\n\nOthers have stated that it could lead to other states resorting to the production of WMDs or terrorist activities.  This doctrine is argued to be contrary to the just war theory and would constitute a war of aggression. Patrick J. Buchanan wrote that the 2003 invasion of Iraq had significant similarities to the 1996 neoconservative policy paper A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm.\n\nPolitical scientist Karen Kwiatkowski in 2007 wrote on her article \"Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine\":\n\nWe are killing terrorists in self-defense and for the good of the world, you see. We are taking over foreign countries, setting them up with our favorite puppets \"in charge,\" controlling their economy, their movements, their dress codes, their defensive projects, and their dreams, solely because we love them, and apparently can't live without them.\n\nRadical departure\nAccording to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a radical departure from former United States foreign policies, and a continuation of the ideological roots of neoconservatism.\n\nInitially, support for the United States was high, but by the end of the Bush administration, after seven years of war, anti-Americanism was high and criticism of the Bush Doctrine was widespread; nonetheless the doctrine still had support among some United States political leaders.\n\nThe representation of prominent neoconservatives and their influences on the Bush Doctrine had been highly controversial among the American public.\n\nCritics, like John Micklethwait in the book The Right Nation, claim that Bush was deceived by neoconservatives into adopting their policies.\n\nPolarization\nAnti-war critics have claimed that the Bush Doctrine was strongly polarizing domestically, had estranged allies of the United States, and belied Bush's stated desire to be a \"uniter, not a divider\".\n\nCompassionate belief and religious influence\nBush often talked about his belief in compassionate conservatism and liberty as \"God's gift\". In his Claremont Institute article Democracy and the Bush Doctrine, Charles R. Kesler wrote, \"As he begins his second term, the president and his advisors must take a hard, second look at the Bush Doctrine. In many respects, it is the export version of compassionate conservatism.\"\n\nSociopsychological strategy and effects\nThere is also criticism on Bush Doctrine practices related to their sociopsychological effects saying they create a culture of fear.\n\nNaomi Klein wrote in her book The Shock Doctrine about a recurrent metaphor of shock, and she claimed in an interview that the Bush administration continued to exploit a \"window of opportunity that opens up in a state of shock\", followed by a comforting rationale for the public, as a form of social control.\n\nDemocratization\nSome commentators argue that the Bush Doctrine has not aimed to support genuine democratic regimes driven by local peoples, but rather US-friendly regimes installed by diplomats acting on behalf of the United States, and intended only to seem democratic to U.S. voters. For example, in the case of Afghanistan, it is argued that parliamentary democracy was downplayed by the US and power concentrated in the hands of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, a US ally. The election of Karzai has been described as the result of manipulation on the parts of the US government and US policy maker Zalmay Khalilzad. At the same time, these commentators draw attention to the number of unpopular (but US-friendly) warlords achieving \"legitimating\" positions under US supervision of the elections. Some commentators interpreted voter turnout figures as evidence of \"large-scale fraud\". Sonali Kolhatkar and James Ingalls have written, \"It remains to be seen if U.S. policy makers will ever allow anything approaching democracy to break out in Afghanistan and interfere with their plans.\"\n\nOf the elections in Afghanistan, Sima Samar, former Afghan Minister for Women's Affairs, stated, \"This is not a democracy, it is a rubber stamp. Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones.\"\n\nMost studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the history of the United States exporting democracy. John A. Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using Freedom House data. While in 63 cases a country did become more democratic, in 69 instances the country became less democratic - and the plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy.\n\nSee also\n American imperialism\n Monroe Doctrine\n Truman Doctrine\n Carter Doctrine\n Clinton Doctrine\n Jus ad bellum\n Military intervention\n Obama Doctrine\n Powell Doctrine\n Reagan Doctrine\n Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration\n The One Percent Doctrine\n United States Presidential doctrines\n War on Terrorism\n Weinberger Doctrine\n Wolfowitz Doctrine\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Bacevich, Andrew J.

Bush, adopted on September 20, 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States the previous year. The Bush Doctrine holds that the United States has the right to wage pre-emptive war to forestall potential terrorist attacks. The Bush Doctrine also holds that the United States is justified in attacking a country that either harbors or supports terrorist organizations, even if the country is not itself attacked. The Bush Doctrine was controversial and was the subject of widespread criticism, even within the United States. The Bush Doctrine was a significant shift in the foreign policy of the United States. For much of its history, the United States had a \"no first strike\" policy, which held that the United States would not initiate a nuclear strike against another country. This policy was a response to the beginning of the nuclear age, and was influenced by the experience of the First and Second World Wars. The Bush Doctrine, however, was a \"first strike\" policy, which gave the United States the right to initiate a war if it determined that a potential enemy state was developing nuclear weapons. The Bush Doctrine was first articulated in a speech by President Bush in October 2002. In the speech, Bush stated that the United States would take \"preemptive action\" against countries that were developing nuclear weapons. He also stated that the United States would take \"preventive action\" against countries that were harboring or supporting terrorist organizations. The Bush Doctrine was further clarified in a document released by the White House in January 2003. The document, known as the National Security Strategy, stated that the United States would take \"preemptive action\" against countries that were developing weapons of mass destruction, or that were harboring or supporting terrorist organizations.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 88529}

The work is in three movements, although the third is labeled as an \"Intermezzo\". The first movement is in sonata form, with a theme (which becomes the basis of the entire symphony) presented in the first few bars. A subsidiary theme appears in the developmental section, and the movement ends with a restatement of the main theme. The second movement is in A-B-A form. The A section is based on a song-like theme, while the B section is more animated. The symphony's main theme returns in the A section of the third movement, which is in rondo form. The theme is repeated in a major key, then a minor key, followed by a brief developmental section. The coda brings the symphony to a close by repeating the theme once more in a major key. The symphony is scored for a large orchestra, including three flutes (third doubling piccolo), three oboes (third doubling English horn), three clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet), three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), six horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, and strings.

When the club signed Tommy Taylor from Barnsley in 1953, the fee was intended to be £30,000. However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"£30,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by £1 to £29,999. Busby then took the extra pound from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.\n\nManchester United made their first six-figure signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for £110,000, a new British record. The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5 million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7 million, almost double their previous record of £3.75 million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier. In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven £19 million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then £28.1 million to Lazio for Juan Sebastián Verón. Manchester United have broken the British transfer record three times since buying Verón, with the signings of Rio Ferdinand in July 2002, Ángel Di María in August 2014 and Paul Pogba in August 2016.\n\nTransfers in bold are also records for fees paid by British clubs\n\nHighest transfer fees received\n\nThe club's record sale came in July 2009, when they sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80 million.\n\nProgression of record fee received\nThe first player for whom Manchester United, then Newton Heath, received a fee was William Bryant, who moved to Blackburn Rovers for just £50 in April 1900. That same month, Manchester City paid five times more for Scottish forward Joe Cassidy. The club's first £1,000 sale came 12 years later with the sale of Harold Halse to Aston Villa.\n\nThe club's first British record sale came in March 1949, when Derby County paid £24,500 for Johnny Morris. However, 35 years passed before Manchester United next broke the record for the biggest sale by a British club; the sale of Ray Wilkins to Milan for £1.5 million in June 1984 was also the club's first million-pound sale. Another British record followed two years later with the sale of Mark Hughes to Barcelona for £2.5 million. The club's record sale increased fivefold in the space of two transfers over the next 15 years; first with the £7 million sale of Paul Ince to Internazionale in 1995, and then the 2001 transfer of Jaap Stam to Lazio for £15.25 million. Manchester United broke the world transfer record for the first time in July 2009 with the £80 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid.\n\nTransfers in bold are also British record transfers\n\nManagerial records\n\n First full-time manager: Jack Robson – Robson was manager of Manchester United for 6 years and 10 months, starting on 28 December 1914, before pneumonia forced his retirement in October 1921.\n Longest-serving manager: Sir Alex Ferguson – 26 years, 194 days (1,500 matches;

He subsequently served as Governor of Bermuda from 1949 to 1955.\n\nEarly life \nHood was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and educated at George Watson's College. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1910 and achieving his MD in 1931 for his research on dysentery. In 1918, Hood married Evelyn Dulcia Ellwood, with whom he had one son and two daughters.\n\nMilitary career \nAfter spending one year as the house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Hood joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He served in France and Belgium during the First World War, and then in India and Afghanistan shortly afterwards. He became a specialist in pathology, serving in Meerut and Bangalore and then as deputy assistant district pathologist for Madras region. Hood conducted research on cerebrospinal meningitis and pneumonic plague, and in 1929 he was appointed assistant district pathologist to Southern Command.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Hood was given the rank of colonel and made deputy director of medical services, Palestine. In 1941, he was promoted over several more senior figures to become Lieutenant-General Director General Army Medical Services. As DGAMS, Hood was credited with supporting developments in Army Psychiatry, helping to provide forward surgery and reorganise field medical units, and organising a blood transfusion service. By August, he was also honorary physician to George VI. He served for far longer as DGAMS than was usual. He also decreed that medical research conducted on soldiers should be solely for the purpose of preventing and curing disease and allaying injury. Hood had hoped to become the first head of a combined medical service for Navy, Army and Air Force, but this did not happen.\n\nCivil career \nHood worked for one year in the Ministry of Health. After this, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief Bermuda. As Governor, Hood oversaw the closure of the Bermuda Garrison in 1953 and also acted as host to Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Bermuda Conferences. The closure of the garrison was completed by 1 May 1953, but was very short-lived. However, a detachment of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was temporarily posted to Bermuda immediately after for the period of the conference, planned for June, 1953. The conference was actually delayed until December, when the Prime Minister was convinced to reverse the closure of the garrison, resulting in 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (1 DCLI) being posted to Prospect Camp in 1954. Hood's tenure in the role was extended twice.\n\nHood resigned effective 26 April 1955, with no explanation given. A few months later, he was granted a divorce from Lady Evelyn Dulcia Hood and married Mrs Helen Winifred Wilkinson of Hamilton, Bermuda on the same day.\n\nOther achievements \nHood enjoyed golf and was the RAMC champion. He won the Queen Victoria Jubilee Vase at St Andrews in 1953.\n\nWhen Hood died in Bermuda on 11 September 1980, his service with the RAMC was commemorated by the naming in his honour of a lecture theatre in the training depot.\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery holds a number of photographic images of Hood, mostly by Walter Stoneman.\n\nLinks \n*Portrait of Sir Alexander Hood at the National Portrait Gallery\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\nGenerals of World War II\n\n1888 births\n1980 deaths\nGolfers from Edinburgh\nPeople educated at George Watson's College\nRoyal Army Medical Corps officers\nGovernors of Bermuda\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire\nFellows of the Royal College of Physicians\nFellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\nAlumni of the University of Edinburgh\nBritish Army personnel of World War I\nBritish Army generals of World War II\nBritish civil servants\nBritish Army generals\nCommanders of the Legion of Merit\nKnights of the Order of Orange-Nassau\nKnights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order\nScottish male golfers\nScottish pathologists\n20th-century surgeons\nMilitary personnel from Edinburgh", "machine_text": " Alexander Hood (1888–1961) was a British Army officer who served in both the First and Second World Wars.

He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, a public school in Hertfordshire, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 12 December 1908. He served in the First World War, during which he was wounded, and was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in September 1916 for his part in the Battle of Delville Wood. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in January 1917, and given command of the 15th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. After the war, he became a member of the British Military Mission to Poland, and was involved in the training of the Polish Army. He was also a member of the British Olympic Committee, and was involved in the organisation of the Olympic Games in London in 1948. In the Second World War, he was initially involved in the development of British tank tactics, and was later given command of the 7th Armoured Division, which he led in the Battle of Alam el Halfa in September 1942. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in January 1943, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in June 1945. After the war, he was a member of the British Delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and was involved in the negotiations for the Korean War.

It is the largest such organization in the region.\n\nHistory\nThe organization was founded in 1984 by Pam Lawler. In the year 2005, it merged with The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, and the new entity operates under the name Philabundance.\n\nGoals\nThe organization aims to drive hunger from our communities today and end hunger forever.\n\nOrganization\nPhilabundance serves 90,000 people each week, 30% of whom are children, 15% of whom are seniors, and others served include students, the working poor, veterans and single parents. It has its own programs, as well as a network of 350 agencies, including emergency kitchens, shelters and soup kitchens. As of 2017, 1 in 8 people in the U.S. face hunger while in our area, that number is 1 in 5, making hunger a crisis in the Delaware Valley on which we need all need to collaborate to eradicate.\n\nPhilabundance works with local grocers and farmers to rescue perfectly good food that would otherwise go to waste; in 2016, it rescued 10 million pounds of food for its neighbors in need. The organization also hosts events alongside the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.\n\nTrends\nClients Who Volunteer - Many of Philabundance's 15,000 volunteers are also clients, especially at its Fresh for All program. These volunteers spend 2–3 hours a week distributing food to others, while they themselves need help, and are allowed to take the same amount of food as those attending the program.\n\nHungry Students – Due to rising tuition, and the rules around qualifications for SNAP benefits, many college campuses are seeing a rise in the number of hungry students enrolled. As a result, many schools are opening pantries on campus to serve those in need. Philabundance's partner, the Chester County Food Bank, and other Feeding America food banks have partner with colleges to ensure this population has enough food to survive and thrive in school. Philabundance will soon follow suit.\n\nPrograms\n Fresh For All Program - To help families and individuals in need gain access to fresh vegetables and fruits, Philabundance operates Fresh For All Program at 9 locations in PA and NJ.\n Senior Boxes Program - Gives USDA-sponsored food boxes to approximately 5,000 low-income senior citizens.\n Philabundance Community Kitchen - A culinary, vocational job training program that teaches low-income and unemployed individuals life and job-readiness skills.\n Grocers Against Hunger- a food rescue program that allows participating grocers to donate surplus inventory to Philabundance. The food is later distributed to clients through direct service programs. In 2015, the program saved 10 million pounds of produce that would have otherwise gone to waste.\n KidsBites - The KidsBites initiative provides access to nutritious food in low-income areas for children and their families to help ensure that kids in our service area have the food they need to thrive and grow. Since its inception, KidsBites has provided almost 250,000 pounds of food to children and their families. To meet the needs and size of different communities, Philabundance offers several program models: Mobile pantry; BackPacks; and LunchBoxes.\n\nContributions Received\nA multitude of generous individuals, foundations and corporations support Philabundance. Following are some of the largest annual contributions:\n  Phans Feeding Families: The Philadelphia Phillies and the Citizens Bank, sponsor the annual Phans Feeding Families program, which consists of a night at the ballpark at which there are raffles and fundraisers to benefit Philabundance, as well as food collections at AT&T station and Citizens Bank Park. As part of its support of Phans, Citizen Bank makes an annual donation of $40,000 to support Philabundance' KidsBites initiative.\n SEPTA Stop Hunger at Your Station - The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) supports Philabundance annually, by collecting food at more than 40 SEPTA stations. Stations also collected money, leading to tens of thousands of meals for our neighbors in need.\n 93.3 WMMR's Preston & Steve Camp Out for Hunger – Every year since 1998, Preston & Steve hold a five-day \"Camp Out for Hunger\" event – most recently, at Xfinity Live! This is the largest single-location food drive in the county, raising more than 2.6 million pounds of food and $200,000 in 2019's drive and over 14 million pounds in since its inception. The event was aimed at increasing hunger awareness, as well as collecting food for Philabundance. The event featured popular bands and distinguished guests showing their support for Philabundance. Keeping with tradition, Preston and Steve camp at the spot in a trailer all through the week.\n 6abc's Holiday Food Drive: Each year, 6abc and partners Dunkin Donuts and ACME raise food, funds and awareness of Philabundance from Thanksgiving through the New Year. Elements of the campaign include donations at ACME stores, a 6abc telethon and Dunkin Donuts in-store promotions. \n Toyota Hauls Away Hunger: The Toyota Dealership Association of the Delaware Valley holds a literal food drive each December in which more than 50 Tundras caravan from Philabundance's warehouse in North Philly to Citizen Bank Park parking lot, hauling food to help feed those in need.\n Fraud Street Run: Two Philadelphia runners, Chip and Jeff of the Junk Miles Podcast, organised a charity run inspired by the Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference.

In 2019, Philabundance distributed over 24 million pounds of food, including over 1.4 million pounds of fresh produce, to people in need in Philadelphia, Delaware, and South Jersey. Philabundance was founded in 1984 by an organization called Share, which was formed by a group of women volunteering at a local soup kitchen. The Greater Philadelphia Food Bank distributed over 6 million pounds of food in its first year, and expanded its services to include programs such as Pantries On Wheels (POW), a mobile food pantry; the Capital For Hunger Campaign, which raises money to buy fresh produce; and the Philabundance Community Kitchen, which prepares hot meals for people in need. Philabundance is a member of Feeding America, a national network of food banks. It is also a member of the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations and the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. In 2013, Philabundance merged with The Food Bank of South Jersey, which allowed the organization to expand its service area to include Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey. In 2015, Philabundance opened its new headquarters in Philadelphia's Navy Yard. The new facility allowed the organization to increase its distribution capacity to over 30 million pounds of food per year. In 2018, Philabundance changed its name to Philabundance to better reflect its mission of fighting hunger in the Philadelphia region.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 29878986}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Austin Armoured Car\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Austin Armoured Car was a British armoured car produced during the First World War. The vehicle is best known for its employment by the Imperial Russian Army in the First World War and by different forces in the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn addition to the British-built Austins, a few dozens of vehicles were manufactured in Russia in 1918–20. These are usually referred to as Austin-Putilov or – if fitted with a Kégresse halftrack chassis – Austin-Kégresse.\n\nProduction history\n\nBritish Austins\n\nIn August 1914, just after the beginning of the First World War, the army of the Russian Empire started to form armoured car units. Due to limited production capabilities of the country's automotive industry it was decided to order a number of vehicles abroad. A committee was sent to the United Kingdom, but failed to find an armoured car that met their requirements for overhead protection and two machine gun turrets.\n\nTo meet these requirements, the Austin Motor Company designed a new armoured car. The vehicle, known as Austin 1st series, was based on a passenger car chassis with rear-axle drive. Wheels were wooden, spoked, with pneumatic tyres and an additional set of wheels with full rubber tyres for use in combat was carried. Two Maxim machine guns were mounted in separate turrets placed on both sides of the hull behind the driver's cab. The vehicle was protected by armour plates 3.5–4 mm thick screwed to a body frame. The crew of four – commander, driver and two gunners – could enter or leave the vehicle via a door on the left side of the cab or via big two-leaf rear door. On 29 September 1914, 48 armoured cars were ordered. One car cost 1,150 pounds. After arrival in Russia the front and turret armour was replaced with 7 mm plates. First combat experience, however, revealed that the protection was still too weak and the vehicles were fully rearmoured at Izhorski Works, Izhorsk. The improved armour made the Austins much heavier, resulting in limited mobility and occasionally in chassis damage. However, the car was still considered more successful than alternative designs by, among others, Armstrong Whitworth, Renault and Sheffield-Simplex.\n\nOn 6 March 1915 the Russians ordered 60 vehicles of an improved design, known as Austin 2nd series. This time the chassis of a 1.5 ton truck with a more powerful engine was used. The hull was shorter, with thicker armour, the driver's cab roof was modified to improve machine guns' angle of fire. Less welcome was a removal of rear access door. The army also decided it wanted a rear driving post, so after arrival to Russia all vehicles were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section, which housed a second driving post and additional hatch. Another upgrade was the addition of side shields to the machine guns.\n\nSixty units of Austin 3rd series were ordered on 25 August 1916. The vehicles were similar in characteristics to the 2nd series, but had modified rear hull with driving post, MG shields, bulletproof glass in the front vision slots and lacked big side windows.\n\nYet another version, with strengthened chassis and double rear wheels, sometimes referred to as Austin model 1918, was ordered in 1917 but due to events in Russia none were delivered.\n\nRussian Austins\n\nIn 1916 a decision was made to produce a Russian armoured car on the well known Austin chassis. Sixty chassis units – identical to those used in 3rd series – were ordered from Austin. The mission of building armoured hulls was entrusted to Putilovski Works, Saint Petersburg. It was planned to build the cars by July 1917, but work was virtually brought to halt by the February Revolution and the subsequent chaos. Not until March 1918 were the first cars produced. Later the production was transferred to Izhorski Works. A total of 33 vehicles were produced in 1918–1920. In contemporary Russian documents the model was referred to as Russian Austin (Russian: Русский Остин – Russkij Ostin), but eventually became better known as Austin-Putilov (Russian: Остин-Путиловец – Ostin-Putilovets).\n\nTwelve hulls identical to those of Austin-Putilov were mounted on a Kégresse halftrack chassis, resulting in vehicles known as Austin-Kégresse. Production continued from July 1919 until March 1920 when it was stopped by shortage of materials and parts.\n\nRussian Austins' most obvious features were diagonally placed MG turrets (in order to reduce width) and additional right side door. They also had MG mounts with better elevation and other minor improvements.\n\nService history\n\nRussia\n\nArrival of the 1st series Austins allowed the formation of automobile machine gun platoons (Russian: пулемётный автомобильный взвод – pulemyotniy avtomobilniy vzvod or автопулемётный взвод – avtopulemyotniy vzvod). First platoons (5–12), formed according to the organization no. 19, each had three Austins, four staff cars, a truck, a workshop truck, a tanker truck and four motorcycles, with personnel of four officers and 45–46 soldiers. Further platoons (13–24, 26–28, 30–36), formed according to the organization no. 20, received only two Austins, but had a gun section consisting from a gun-armed Garford-Putilov Armoured Car, a staff car, a truck and a motorcycle. Platoons 5 to 12 received an additional Garford. Crews of those auto-MG platoons were entirely drawn from volunteers. Most of the platoons were used in the Western and South-Western Fronts, some platoons in the Northern Front and Caucasus. In combat they were attached to divisions or regiments.\n\nBy mid-1916 it was evident that larger units should be formed to make armoured cars more effective. In August, platoons were arranged into twelve \"armoured automobile battalions\" (Russian: броневой автомобильный дивизион – bronyevoy avtomobilniy divizion or автобронедивизион – avtobronedivizion), each attached to a specific army. Each battalion was formed from two to five former platoons, which were renamed to sections whilst retaining the old number. In some cases, for example in the Caucasus theatre, the platoon organization was retained.\n\nIn the Russian Civil War Austins were used by many participants, including both Red and White armies, Ukrainians etc. The Red Army had the largest number of vehicles, including all the Austin-Putilov and Austin-Kergesse vehicles and most of the 3rd series. In Soviet service the cars were organized into \"armoured automobile units\" (Russian: броневой автомоильный отряд – bronevoy avtomobilniy otryad or автоброневой отряд – avtobronevoy otryad), similar in strength to a World War I-era platoon: three machine gun-armed cars and one either gun-armed or machine gun-armed, four staff cars, five trucks, a tanker truck, a workshop truck and four motorcycles. The RKKA Austins also saw combat in the Polish-Soviet War. By 1921 the RKKA possessed about 16 Austins of the 1st series, 15 2nd series, 78 3rd series and Putilovs. British-built Austins were removed from service by 1931, and by 1933, the Russian-built ones were also retired.\n\nThe Austin-Putilov armoured car named Vrag Kapitala (Enemy of the Capital), on display at the Artillery Museum, Saint Petersburg, is often referred to as the vehicle which Lenin stood on to address the crowd in April 1917. However, it cannot be true as this armoured car was only manufactured in 1919.\n\nOther users\n\nBritish\nSixteen of the Austins built for Russian but not sent following the revolution were used to equip the 17th (Armoured Car) Battalion of the Tank Corps. The Vickers machine guns were exchanged for the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun, which was the standard machine gun of the British tank unit. The 17th Battalion arrived in France in April 1918. Its first operations were in support of the French Army in June. It returned to the British Army in August and was very successful at the Battle of Amiens. The Austins were towed in pairs by tanks across the mud of no-man's-land. Once they reached better ground on the other side of the lines, they ranged freely. A German Corps headquarters 10 miles back was captured and German reserves, artillery and supply lines were shot up. Having crossed the German frontier at Malmedy, Belgium, on 1 December 1918 after the Armistice, the 17th was the first British unit to enter Cologne on the Rhine on the 8th, escorting the Commanding Officer of 2nd Cavalry Brigade to negotiate Allied control of the city.\n\nAfter the war, the bodies were reused on Peerless lorry chassis. Some of these were still in service at the start of the Second World War.\n\nSome cars were sent to the Caspian Sea region. Austins were also used by the British in the Irish War of Independence.\n\nVariants\n Austin 1st series (or model 1914) – based on a passenger car chassis with 30 hp engine and rear axle drive. Wheels wooden, spoked. 3.5–4 mm armour, eventually replaced with 7 mm plates. Weight with original armour 2.66 ton. Road speed 50–60 km/h. Road range 250 km. Crew of 4 (commander, driver and two gunners). 48 units built.\n Austin 2nd series (or model 1915) – based on 1.5 ton truck chassis with 50 hp engine, shortened hull, thicker armour, redesigned driver's cab roof, no rear door. After arrival to Russia were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section (with second driving post and rear hatch) and MG side shields. Weight 5.3 ton. Road speed about 60 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 4–5. 60 units built.\n Austin 3rd series – Modified rear section and in the driver's cab, rear driver post, MG side shields, bulletproof glass in front vision slots, no big side windows, no rear hatch. Weight 5.3 ton. Road speed about 60 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 4–5. 60 units built.\n Austin model 1918 – Strengthened chassis, double rear wheels. 70 vehicles were ordered, but were not delivered due to events in Russia in 1917.\n Austin-Putilov – Had locally produced hull designed by the Putilovski Works, with diagonally placed MG turrets, right side door and thicker armour. Chassis, the same as in the 3rd series, were still ordered from Austin. Armour 4 to 7.5 mm thick. Weight 5.2 tons. Road speed about 55 km/h. Road range 200 km. Crew of 5. 33 built.\n\n Austin-Kegresse (or Austin-Putilov-Kegresse) – Austin-Putilov hull mounted on a half-track chassis. Weight 5.8–5.9 tons. Road speed about 25 km/h. Road range 100 km. 12 built.\n Armoured hulls of damaged Austins were sometimes (mostly during the Russian Civil War) mounted on other chassis, usually White, Fiat or Packard. The combination of White chassis and Austin hull is sometimes referred to as White-Austin.\n\nOperators \n\n The last active Austin was probably the vehicle employed by the Austrian Army until 1935.\n\n At least one car was captured at the Dobruja Front at 17 November 1916 by the Bulgarian Armed Forces.\n\n Estonian Army used two captured Austin-Putilovs, named Tasuja and Suur Tõll.\n\n Two Austins 3rd series, initially sent by the Soviets in 1918 to help the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War, were taken over by the Finnish Army, which used them until the mid-1920s.\n\n Armed forces of Democratic Republic of Georgia operated several Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n Few captured vehicles were used during World War I on both fronts. Four vehicles, two 2nd Series and two 3rd Series, were used in 1918-1919 by the Freikorps armoured unit Kokampf (Kommando der Kampfwagenabteilungen) formed in Berlin as Kampfwagen Abteilung Körting to suppress the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in Berlin, Munich and Leipzig.\n\n A small number of Austin model 1918s were imported by the Japanese Army, where they remained in service until the early 1930s.\n\n Latvian Army used one Austin 2nd series, named Zemgaleetis (Zemgalietis in modern spelling), captured from the Soviets during the Latvian War of Independence.\n\n Two or three cars were given by the Soviets to the Mongolian People's Army in the early 1920s.\n\n Polish Armed Forces captured up to 20 Austins from the Soviets during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. Some were subsequently employed by the Polish. Five remained in service after the war, some until the 1930s.\n\n At least one Austin and four Austin-Putilovs were used by the Romanian Army.\n\n The Imperial Russian Army was the main user of Austin Armored Cars and after the end of the First World War the vehicles went to the Bolsheviks, White Russians, Georgia and Ukraine, among others.\n\n Vehicles taken over by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army initially went into action in the Russian Civil War, and were later used to suppress independent republics established in the former Russian Empire.\n\n Ukrainian People's Army operated unknown number of Austins in 1918-1921 period, those armoured cars were leftovers from Imperial Russian Army.\n\n British Army\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n M.

It was developed from the Austin 14 hp light truck in 1937, by the British Austin Motor Company at their Longbridge plant in Birmingham. The vehicle was developed to meet the British Army's need for a small fast-moving reconnaissance vehicle, to replace the Morris CS9 in this role. As well as reconnaissance, the vehicle was used for conveying messages, personnel and light supplies. It could be equipped with a No 19 wireless set, had a small locker in the rear and could carry two people in the front and one in the back. A total of 22,000 were produced and they were used by the British and other Allied armies during the Second World War, and also by the Soviet Red Army. It was a small four-wheeled vehicle with a box-like body, the engine at the front, and the driver sitting above and ahead of the front axle. It had a small bench seat at the back for two people. The vehicle was open at the top and sides, although some vehicles had a canvas top that could be erected for protection from the weather. The car was built on a standard Austin 30 chassis. The engine, a new design 4-cylinder unit with a capacity of 918 cc, gave a top speed of 65 mph (105 km/h). The standard version had a 4-speed gearbox and a hand-operated brake on the transmission. There was also a de-tuned 2-speed version with an extra low-speed ratio, for off-road use, which also had a hand-operated rear brake. The suspension was by leaf springs all round, with half-elliptical springs at the front and rear. The wheels were of a new design, being pressed-steel with a plain, rather than studded, tyre tread. A small number of Austin Armoured Cars were built for the Royal Air Force, to be used by their Air/Sea Rescue units. These had a 25 hp (19 kW) engine and were painted blue. After the war, the vehicle was developed into the Austin Champ.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4723660}

Buck Martinez was fired about a third of the way through the season, with a 20–33 record. He was replaced by third base coach Carlos Tosca, an experienced minor league manager. They went 58–51 under Tosca to finish the season 78–84. Roy Halladay, a talented but inconsistent prospect who was no more than a fifth starter who alternated between Toronto and Triple-A during his first three seasons, was relied on as the team's ace and rose to the challenge being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19–7 record and a 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by Carlos Delgado. Ricciardi was credited for dumping Raúl Mondesí in mid-season to the New York Yankees to free up his salary, which in turn was used for the off-season signing of Mike Bordick, Frank Catalanotto and Tanyon Sturtze. Promising young players were assigned to key roles, including starting third baseman Eric Hinske (who later won the Rookie of the Year Award for this year) and 23-year-old centre fielder Vernon Wells, who had his first 100 RBI season replacing Mondesi. Another bright young player was Josh Phelps, a former catcher turned designated hitter, who hit 15 home runs.\n\nOpening Day starters\n Homer Bush, 2B\n José Cruz, Jr., OF\n Carlos Delgado, 1B\n

Major League Baseball. The Blue Jays finished with a record of 80 wins and 82 losses, good for second place in the American League East, 13 games behind the World Champion New York Yankees. The Blue Jays spent most of the season in a heated race with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees for the division title; the three teams were never more than three games apart throughout the season. On September 28, the Blue Jays suffered a crushing loss to the visiting Yankees when second baseman Howie Clark committed three errors in the seventh inning, allowing the Yankees to score seven runs and put the game out of reach. The Blue Jays lost the game 13–5 and dropped three games out of first. The Blue Jays went on to win three of their final four games, while the Yankees won six in a row to capture the division by three games. The Blue Jays qualified for the playoffs for the fourth year in a row, and were once again matched up against the Texas Rangers in the ALDS. The Blue Jays swept the Rangers in three games, advancing to the ALCS for the third time in four years. In the ALCS, the Blue Jays lost to the Yankees in four straight games. Offensively, the Blue Jays were led by left fielder Vernon Wells, who won the AL MVP Award, and right fielder Jose Cruz Jr., who led the league in hits (210) and finished second in batting average (.332). Wells became the first Blue Jay to win an MVP Award. On the pitching side, the Blue Jays had three starters with at least 20 wins for the first time since 1990. Right-hander Roy Halladay had a 20–7 record with a 3.27 ERA, left-hander David Wells won 22 games with a 4.46 ERA, and right-hander Pat Hentgen went 20–10 with a 4.46 ERA. In addition, the Blue Jays had four relievers with at least 20 saves. Tom Gordon led the way with 47 saves, and was named the AL Rolaids Relief Pitcher of the Year. This was the first season the Blue Jays played in their new home, Rogers Centre, which was previously known as SkyDome. The team had played in SkyDome since 1989. Also, this was the first season the Blue Jays were managed by John Gibbons. Gibbons took over for Buck Martinez, who managed the team in 2001.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 12206056}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"List of Buck Rogers comic strips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Listing of the publication history for the Buck Rogers comic strip.\n\nThe history of the Buck Rogers comic strip is a complicated one. The early strips were numbered rather than dated, and every so often the numbering was restarted, creating a new strip numbering \"series\". To add to the complexity, different newspapers ran the strips on different days – sometimes several months apart from each other.

He enjoyed much success as a youngster, winning numerous national championships at his age level, and at levels above his own age. This success did not go unnoticed, as he was shortlisted for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2005, and finished in second place after Theo Walcott in 2006. He was again shortlisted for this award in 2007. He once again finished in 2nd place in 2007.\n\nIn April 2008 Drinkhall signed with the German team TTC Indeland Jülich for the 2008–09 season, having previously played for another German club, Goennern.

His results on the ITTF World Tour meant he qualified for the Grand Finals to be played in Bangkok in December, becoming the first Englishman to compete at the event since 1996. His performances also lifted him to a new career high of No 33 in the ITTF world rankings.\n\nAt the inaugural European Games in Baku in June 2015, Drinkhall was seeded 16 and reached the semi-finals, losing to top seed Dimitrij Ovtcharov.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 10 and 11 October 1922, and elected 78 members of the First Seimas of Lithuania. This was the first election held in Lithuania under the democratic 1922 Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania on 1 August 1922.\n\n38 out of 78 seats were won by a bloc of parties led by the Christian Democrats, and they acquired both the positions of President and Prime Minister, occupied by Aleksandras Stulginskis and Ernestas Galvanauskas respectively. In both cases, however, the Christian Democrats were not supported by any party in the opposition and could only form a minority government. Unable to work with such a makeup, the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nElectoral system\nThe law on the conduct of Seimas elections was promulgated by the Constituent Assembly on 19 July 1922, and published in the official newspaper of the government, \"Vyriausybės žinios\" (Government News) on 27 July 1922. Elections were universal, free and secret, and all citizens of Lithuania, both men and women over 21 years old, were allowed to vote. Citizens 24 years old or older were allowed to stand for election.\n\nThe elections were held with party-list proportional representation, in nine multi-member constituencies. In practice, only six of the nine defined constituencies held elections, as Constituencies VII, VIII and IX were allocated to territories occupied by Poland during the Polish–Lithuanian War in 1920. Their centers were Vilnius, Lida and Hrodna respectively.\n\nParties and electoral groups (kuopa) were allowed to submit lists of candidates to constituencies, which had to be signed by at least fifty voters. As such, there was a large number of small electoral lists in every constituency. However, the method of calculating the distribution of seats in each constituency benefited larger parties, as such, the only non-party electoral group which managed to gain seats were lists submitted by the underground Communist Party of Lithuania.\n\nCompeting parties\nThe largest and most active electoral alliance in the election was the Christian Democratic Bloc, formed from the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and two satellite organizations - Labour Federation, which represented Catholic workers, and Farmers' Association, which represented Catholic peasantry. The Christian Democratic Bloc was strongly supported by the Lithuanian priesthood, which had a strong influence in the agrarian and less literate countryside, and numerous priests were a part of their electoral lists.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats were isolated in the political arena. Historically, LKDP evolved from a different stream of the Lithuanian National Revival than all of their competitors - the Peasant Union, Social Democrats and Party of National Progress (later the Lithuanian Nationalist Union). All of them evolved from the secular nationalist newspaper Varpas, while the Christian Democrats evolved around the Catholic periodical Tėvynės sargas.\n\nThe alliance of the Peasant Union and Popular Socialist Party presented itself as socialist and campaigned for the lifting of martial law and secularization. Though the main targets of the criticism were Christian Democrats and National Progress, they were also in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats presented their electoral campaign as the first step towards a peaceful socialist revolution and campaigned for a \"Seimas of the workers\". All political parties supported the land reforms put in place by the Constituent Assembly, and oftentimes argued that their competitors will be the ones to roll back the reform.\n\nSeparate electoral lists by the Polish, Jewish and Russian minorities also competed in the election.\n\nResults\n\nAftermath\nThough the Christian Democratic Bloc achieved a plurality of the seats, they were unable to form a majority coalition, nor did the opposition parties manage to unite against them. The next President and Prime Minister were thus elected via violations of electoral conduct. Protesting against the Christian Democrats, the opposition parties refused to participate in the election of Aleksandras Stulginskis and he was elected solely with Christian Democratic votes. Two governments led by independent politician Ernestas Galvanauskas were formed, but in both cases they were approved with 38 votes in favor and 38 votes against (2 members of the Seimas did not participate), which the opposition criticized as illegal.\n\nThe formed government was unstable and the First Seimas was dissolved on 12 March 1923.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary election\nLithuanian parliamentary election\nParliamentary elections in Lithuania", "machine_text": " 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election The 1922 Lithuanian parliamentary election was held on 30 May 1922. It was the first election after Lithuania had declared independence in the previous year. The election was held using the proportional representation method, which had been used in the first Russian Revolution in 1917 and in the elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in 1918. The election was boycotted by the majority of the Jewish population. The Jewish organisations had decided to abstain from voting after the election was not postponed following the signing of the Soviet-Lithuanian Peace Treaty in April, which had been opposed by the Jews. The election turnout was 36.5%, with 1, 1992,6 voters participating. The representatives of the Farmers' Association won a majority of 65 seats in the 132-seat parliament. The Country Union, which had won a majority in the last election in 1918, won only 20 seats. After the elections, the Farmers' Association formed a coalition government with the Socialists, the Nationalists, and the Christian Democrats.

It is on the east bank of the Saint Marys River, which is a tributary of the Bay of Fundy, in the Annapolis Valley. The community is on the north boundary of the town of Digby. The community was first settled in the early 1700s and was known as \"Tammany\" after Tamanend, a Delaware Indian chief. It was the site of one of the first shipyards in the Atlantic Canada region. In his book \"The History of Digby\", J.W. Duckworth wrote in 1895 \"The ship-building firm of John hall & Company, of London, engaged in the building of ships in the year 1792, in a yard at Tammany on the St. Mary's river, three miles below Digby. The first ship, the \"James and Mary\", was launched in 1793, and was followed by the \"HMS surveyed\", a 54-foot-keel, 20-ton gunboat, built for the British government for the protection of the fisheries. This was launched in 1796. The yard continued in operation for many years, and the \"HMS Archer\", a Rating four, 54-foot-keel gunboat, was launched there in 1811. During the War of 1812, the \"HMS Archer\" was on the Great Lakes, and was captured by the Americans at the Battle of Lake Erie. In 1825 the British government established the \"HMS Dauphine\" at Tammany, as a depot for the West Indies squadron. This was a Rating six, 64-foot-keel, 20-gun, brass-plated ship, built at Deptford, England, in 1824. It was commanded by Captain George Muttlebury. The ship left England in September 1824, arriving in Digby in October. The crew spent the winter of 1824–1825 there, suffering from \" shipbuildingitis\", a term used to describe what the author believed was the first case of what is now called \"seasonal affective disorder\". The \"Dauphine\" left Digby in May 1825 to join the squadron in the West Indies, and was later sold to the Portuguese government. A 20-gun, two-masted corvette, it was renamed the \"D. pmo. Xavier\" and served in the Brazilian navy until 1864. Tammany was the site of an Acadian village, and the French chapel at nearby \"les Mines\" was used by the Acadians, then the French, then the British.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Crips\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Crips is an alliance of street gangs which is based in the coastal regions of southern California. It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely-connected network of individual \"sets\", often engaged in open warfare with one another. Traditionally, since around 1973, its members have worn blue clothing.\n\nThe Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, the members have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. They have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.\n\nEtymology\n\nSome sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, \"Cribs\", was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into \"Crips\" when gang members began carrying around canes to display their \"pimp\" status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or \"Crips\" for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests \"Crips\" may have evolved from \"Cripplers\", a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for \"Common Revolution In Progress\", a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented \"Community Revolutionary Interparty Service\" or \"Community Reform Interparty Service\".\n\nHistory \n\nGang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including: post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty; racial segregation of young African American men, who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, leading to the formation of black \"street clubs\"; and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement.\n\nStanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams however appears to discount the sometimes-cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption. \n\nIn his memoir, Williams also refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it \"depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less.\" Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.\n\nWilliams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levis, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973. The color then became associated with Crips.\n\nBy 1978, there were 45 Crip gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Neighborhood Crips or the Gangster Crips, waging large-scale war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips (from East Los Angeles) and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and influence increased significantly in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets and Crip sets began distributing the drug. Large profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crips membership grew steadily and the street gang was one of the nation's largest by the late 1980s. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crip sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.\n\nMembership\nAs of 2015, the Crips gang consists of between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 members and 800 sets, active in 221 cities and 41 U.S. states. The states with the highest estimated number of Crip sets are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, but can be white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Crip sets are not exclusive to the United States, having a presence in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California.\n\nCrips have served in the United States armed forces and on military bases in the United States and abroad.\n\nPractices\n\nLanguage\nSome practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter \"b\" in the word \"blood\" is \"disrespected\" among certain Crip sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters \"CK\", which are interpreted to stand for \"Crip killer\", are avoided and replaced by \"cc\". For example, the words \"kick back\" are written \"kicc bacc\", and block is written as \"blocc\". Many other words and letters are also altered due to symbolic associations. Crips traditionally refer to each other as \"Cuz\" or \"Cuzz\", which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for a Crip. \"Crab\" is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.\n\nInitiation (\"Jumping in\")\n\nAlthough getting \"jumped into the gang\" is often commonly thought of as a typical initiation ritual performed on newcomers, some former Crip members such as rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, who joined the 24 Street Crips in Sacramento, California during the 1980s has pointed out that the tradition of getting jumped (beaten) into the gang was \"more of a 1970s (era) practice\" rather than a modern or continuing one.\n\nCriminal rackets and street-activities\n\nAs with most criminal street gangs they have traditionally benefited monetarily from a select set of illicit activities such as illegal gambling, drug-dealing, prostitution, burglary, theft and extortion. Along with profitable rackets such as these, they have also been known to participate in vandalism and property crime, often for gang-pride reasons or just enjoyment. This can include public graffiti (tagging) and \"joyriding\" in stolen vehicles.\n\nTheir current primary illicit source of income is presumably in street-level drug distribution, however many Crip members may also make notable amounts of illegal funds from the black market sale of illicit firearms. Historically, the gang’s size and power was largely augmented by the profits from the street sale of crack cocaine throughout the 1980s showing that PCP, amphetamines and other drugs were not as lucrative for them and thus didn’t have as direct of an effect on the group’s increase in influence.  Therefore the gang’s initial phase of growth and popularity can, in some way, be directly traced back to the explosion crack cocaine in the United States during the 1980s.\n\nCrip-on-Crip rivalries \n\nThe Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles.\n\nBy 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods, a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips.\n\nSince then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crip sets. It is a common misconception that Crip sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other—for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals.\n\nAlliances and rivalries\n\nRivalry with Bloods \nThe Bloods are the Crips' main stereotypical rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and, as of 2010, are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles.\n\nAlliance with Folk Nation \nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as \"8-ball\". A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or \"beef\" between Folks and Crips.\n\nSee also \nAfrican-American organized crime\nCrip Walk\nCrime in Los Angeles\nGangs in Los Angeles\nCrips and Bloods: Made in America\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nGeneral \n\n Leon Bing (1991).

It is famous for the City of Refuge, a national historic landmark. The entire district is a traditional Hawaiian sacred site. Honaunau-Napoopoo is located south of Honalo and north of Puuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park, which is often called the \"City of Refuge\". The community includes three main areas: Honaunau Beach, Napoopoo Beach, and Kealakekua Bay. Honaunau Beach is the site of the only major surfing spot in South Kona, known as \"Honaunau\", which is also the name of the beach. The wave breaks across a broad, flat reef and has a reputation for being a \"long, fun ride\". The surf at Honaunau is typically best in the summer months, when south swells come from the Antarctic. In the winter, the surf is smaller, but the waves are more consistent. Napoopoo Beach is a small beach, and is the site of a condo development. The south end of Kealakekua Bay is also known as \"Kealakekua\", but this has a different pronunciation than the northern end of the bay, and is not to be confused with the community of Kealakekua to the north. The lands of the Kona Village Resort extend to the south end of Kealakekua Bay. The Kona Coast is one of the few places in the United States where the coffee plant, Coffea arabica, can be grown commercially. The climate is ideal: Year-round, with moderate rainfall, and a steady temperature around 75 °F (24 °C). Coffee was first brought to the Kona Coast in the 1820s by Christian missionaries. In the 1970s, the region was the first to grow a substantial amount of coffee in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.9 square miles (4.8 km2), of which 1.5 square miles (3.8 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), or 22.58%, is water. As of the census of 2000, there were 2,368 people, 1,010 households, and 733 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,486.3 people per square mile (573.6/km2). There were 1,275 housing units at an average density of 778.9 per square mile (300.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 81.13% White, 2.00% African American, 3.44% Native American, 4.65% Asian, 1.11% Pacific Islander, 2.46% from other races, and 5.61% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.06% of the population. There were 1,010 households, out of which 28.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.0% were non-families. 22.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.84. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 19.6% under the age of 18, 3.6% from 18 to 24, 27.9% from 25 to 44, 29.2% from 45 to 64, and 17.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.1 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $47,cy2, and the median income for a family was $55,000. Men had a median income of $26,9951 versus $24,375 for women. The per capita income for the CDP was $26,153. About 3.2% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.7% of those under age 18 and 2.3% of those age 65 or over.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Clone (computing)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In computing, a clone is hardware or software that is designed to function in exactly the same way as another system. A specific subset of clones are remakes (or remades), which are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued products.\n\nMotivation \nClones and remakes are created for some reasons, including competition, standardization, availability across platforms, and even as homage. Compatibility with the original system is usually the explicit purpose of cloning hardware or low-level software such as operating systems (e.g. AROS and MorphOS are intended to be compatible with AmigaOS). Application software is cloned by providing the same functionality.\n\nCommercially-motivated clones are made often during a competitor product's initial successful commercial run, intentionally competing with the original and trying to participate in their success.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware clones\nWhen IBM announced the IBM PC in 1981, other companies such as Compaq decided to offer clones of the PC as a legal reimplementation from the PC's documentation or reverse engineering. Because most of the components, except the PC's BIOS, were publicly available, all Compaq had to do was reverse-engineer the BIOS. The result was a machine with similar performance and lower price than the machines cloned. The use of the term \"PC clone\" to describe IBM PC compatible computers fell out of use in the 1990s; the class of machines it now describes are simply called PCs, but the early use of the term \"clone\" usually implied a higher level of compatibility with the original IBM PC than \"PC-Compatible\", with (often Taiwanese) clones of the original circuit (and possibly ROMs) the most compatible (in terms of software they would run and hardware tests they would pass), while \"legitimate\" new designs such as the Sanyo MBC-550 and Data General One, while not infringing on copyrights and adding innovations, tended to fail some compatibility tests strongly dependent upon detailed hardware compatibility (such as ability to run Microsoft Flight Simulator, or any software that bypassed the standard software interrupts and directly accessed hardware at the expected pre-defined locations, or—in the case of the MBC-550 for example—wrote diskettes which could not be directly interchanged with standard IBM PCs).\n\nWhile the term has mostly fallen into commercial disuse, the term clone for PCs still applies to a PC made to entry-level or above standard (at the time it was made) which bears no commercial branding (e.g., Acer, IBM, HP, Dell). This includes, but is not limited to, PCs assembled by home users or Corporate IT Departments. (See also White box (computer hardware).)\n\nThere were many Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones due to the popularity and longevity of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nHardware remakes\nExamples for hardware remakes are e.g. recent home computer remakes.\n\nA special kind of hardware remakes are emulators which implement the hardware functionality completely in software. For instance the WinUAE emulator software tries to behave exactly like a physical Amiga.\n\nSoftware\nSoftware can be cloned by reverse engineering or legal reimplementation from documentation or other sources, or by observing a program's appearance and behavior. The reasons for software cloning may include circumventing undesirable licensing fees, acquiring knowledge about the features of the system or creating an interoperable alternative for an unsupported platform. GNU, a clone of UNIX, was motivated by a need of the Free Software Movement for an operating system composed of entirely free software.\n\nIn the United States, the case of Lotus v. Borland allows the functionality of a program to be cloned so long as copyright in the code and interface is not infringed.\n\nYet the public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (such as the appearance of an icon). For example, in August 2012, Electronic Arts, via its Maxis division, put forth a lawsuit against Zynga, claiming that its Facebook game, The Ville was a direct clone of EA's own Facebook game, The Sims Social. The lawsuit challenges that The Ville not only copies the gameplay mechanics of The Sims Social, but also uses art and visual interface aspects that appear to be inspired by The Sims Social. The two companies settled out of court on undisclosed terms in February 2013.\n\nExamples of software cloning include the ReactOS project which tries to clone Microsoft Windows, and GNU Octave, which treats incompatibility with MathWorks MATLAB as a bug.\n\nVideo games \n\nSince the start of the video game industry, clones of successful concepts and games have been common. The first influential first-person shooter, Doom, led in the 1990s to the creation of a new genre dubbed as Doom clones. In the 2000s the open world action-adventure Grand Theft Auto inspired the creation of many Grand Theft Auto clones.\n\nSoftware remakes\n\nRemakes of software are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued software (e.g. Abandonware).\n\nA good share of software remakes are Fangames of computer games and Game engine recreation made by the fan community as part of retrogaming, to address e.g. compatibility issues or non-availability of the original, e.g. a shutdown server gets substituted with a server emulator.\n\nSince the 2000s there has been an increasing number of commercial remakes of classical games by the original developer or publisher for current platforms as the digital distribution lowers the investment risk for niche releases. When enhanced in some way (audio, graphics, etc.) new releases might be called \"High definition\" release or \"Special edition\", an example is The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition.\n\nOther uses of the term\n\nDatabases\nA database clone is a complete and separate copy of a database system that includes the business data, the DBMS software and any other application tiers that make up the environment. Cloning is a different kind of operation to replication and backups in that the cloned environment is both fully functional and separate in its own right. Additionally the cloned environment may be modified at its inception due to configuration changes or data subsetting.\n\nDesktop\n\nSince 2010 clone computing, in the sense of replicating a session on a host computer in a virtual instance in the cloud, has been introduced.  This allows the user to have access to a copy of their PC's desktop on any other computing device such as a tablet computer, a personal computer running any operating system, WebOS, smartphones, etc.\n\nThe clone computer replicates, runs, and is always available through a series of cloud servers.  Unlike remote management software, clone computing has no dependency on the host computer.\n\nDisk cloning software\n\nDisk cloning is the process of copying the contents of one computer hard drive to another disk or to an \"image\" file. Typically, the contents of the first disk are written to an image file as an intermediate step, and the second disk is loaded with the contents of the image. A cloned drive can replace the original, rather than simply containing backup copies of files.\n\nCloning software replicates the operating system, drives, software and patches of one computer for a variety of purposes, including setting up multiple computers, hard drive upgrades, and system recovery in the event of disk failure or corruption.\n\nProgramming\n\nIn computer programming, particularly object-oriented programming, cloning refers to object copying by a method or copy factory function, often called clone or copy, as opposed to by a copy constructor. Cloning is polymorphic, in that the type of the object being cloned need not be specified, in contrast to using a copy constructor, which requires specifying the type (in the constructor call).\n\nSee also \n Plug compatible\n Video game clone\n Video game remake\n Game engine recreation\n :Category:Computer hardware clones\n :Category:Video game console remakes\n\nReferences\n\nComputing terminology", "machine_text": " Clone, in computing, is a term for a copy of a file or a block-level representation of a file in another file, usually with the same name. Cloning is different from a backup, as a backup is a copy of a file with a different name. Cloning is used for the purpose of having two or more exact copies of a file or a data structure that can be modified independently of each other. Changes made to one copy will not affect the other copy. The concept of cloning is similar to that of a fork in software development. Cloning can be done manually or by using a cloning tool. A cloning tool may also be called a \"clone manager\" or a \"cloning application\". There are many reasons for cloning a file. One reason is to have a backup of the file. If the file is important, a clone can be made so that if the original file is lost or damaged, a clone can be used as a backup. Another reason for cloning a file is to have a copy of the file that can be modified without affecting the original file. For example, if a file is being worked on by two or more people, a clone can be made for each person so that they can each make changes to their own copy without affecting the changes made by the other person. Cloning can also be used to create a copy of a file that can be shared with others. For example, if a file is too large to email, a clone can be made and shared via a file-sharing service or a cloud storage service. There are some risks to using cloning. One risk is that if a clone is made of a file that is being worked on by another person, the changes made by the other person may not be reflected in the clone. This can lead to confusion and lost work. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that the clone is made of the most recent version of the file. Another risk is that if a clone is made of a file that is later deleted, the clone may not be able to be recovered. This is because the reference to the original file may be lost, and the clone may only contain a copy of the data from the file.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 874123}

After many delays (primarily due to potential thruster faults), the project was eventually cancelled in January 2007. It was planned to be launched on a Japanese M-V rocket from the Kagoshima Space Center.\n\nHistory\nThe vehicle would have been cylindrical, with a diameter of 2.2 m and a height of 1.7 m. It would have had four solar panels and was engineered to be spin-stabilized. Plans called for it to enter an elliptical orbit around the Moon, and deploy two penetrators at an altitude of 40 km on opposite sides of the lunar body. The penetrators were to have been braked by a small rocket at an altitude of 25 km, then free fall to the surface. They were designed to withstand a collision speed of 330 meters per second to deeply penetrate the lunar regolith.\n\nOnce the penetrators deployed, the LUNAR-A spacecraft was mission-planned to maneuver to an orbital altitude of 200 km above the lunar surface.

The Japanese spacecraft was launched on 19 October 2014, at 20:12 JST (05:12 UTC) from Tanegashima Space Center by a M-V rocket, and arrived at the Moon on 3 April 2015. After a year of scientific operations, the spacecraft was crashed into the Moon's surface on 31 October 2015. The mission made Japan the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, and the first to do so since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. Lunar-A was the first of two missions in the Luna-series, the second being the currently ongoing Luna-C. Luna-A was developed by JAXA, and was a successor to the cancelled Selene lunar probe, which was developed by the same agency. Like Selene, Luna-A was a semi-permanent satellite, and was designed to conduct a comprehensive study of the lunar surface, including the composition and structure of the regolith, the lunar atmosphere, and the origin and evolution of the Moon. Luna-A carried a variety of scientific instruments, including a stereo camera, a spectrometer, and a radar sounder. The spacecraft was also equipped with a small lander, which was designed to conduct a detailed study of the lunar surface. The lander was equipped with a variety of instruments, including a camera, a spectrometer, and a soil analyzer. The lander was designed to survive for one lunar day, or about two Earth years. After the lander's mission was complete, the spacecraft was to return to Earth, and was to be used for future lunar missions. The mission was a great success, and the spacecraft returned a wealth of data on the lunar surface, including the first high-resolution images of the far side of the Moon. The spacecraft was also able to detect a variety of minerals on the lunar surface, including iron, magnesium, and titanium.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Monroe piercing\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A Monroe piercing is a lip piercing placed off-center, above the upper lip on the left-hand side and is meant to resemble Marilyn Monroe's beauty spot, although Monroe's beauty spot was on her cheek, not her lip. The Madonna piercing is similar but worn on the right-hand side.\n\nDescription\nThis piercing is typically fitted with a 14, 16, or 18 gauge labret barbell, the bars of which are usually shortened after healing.  A variation on this piercing are angel bites, with both the Madonna and Monroe style piercings worn on either side of the upper lip. This piercing may also be referred to as a Crayfish, Angel Bites, or Anti Bites, being the anti version of snake bites. When long barbells are worn in this piercing, they look similar to the antennae on a crayfish, hence the name. Most people with a Monroe piercing favor a metal ball or a jewel on the outer-end. The lip can often swell considerably after the piercing and will need both facial and oral aftercare to keep both sides of the jewelry clean at all times. Monroes, like all piercings, are prone to infection and it is vital that the piercing is cleaned regularly. Scarring is minimal to none if properly taken care of.\n\nHealth impacts\nAn advantage of a monroe piercing is that the lip area generally heals faster than other piercings.  The estimated healing time given by professional piercers for this type of lip piercing is between 8–12 weeks, but many find it heals in 3–6 weeks.\n\nThe monroe can be a very painful piercing process, as this area of the body contains a large system of nerves. There is a small risk of piercing the superior labial artery, which lies just above the upper lip.\n\nThe amount of pain experienced during the piercing process differs from person to person and depends on the specific location of the piercing. Those with thicker lips or well-exercised facial muscles will have more flesh or muscle to pierce, so they may experience more discomfort. Men may experience slightly more pain than women, as repeated shaving can make the skin of the upper lip tougher and harder to pierce. The orbicularis oris (the sphincter muscle around the mouth) is used in the playing of brass and woodwind instruments; as a result, players of these instruments tend to have a larger muscle around the mouth and may experience more discomfort during the piercing process.\n\nAs with similar piercings, monroes can cause long-term damage to the gums and teeth. The back-disk of metal jewellery worn in this piercing rubs against them, potentially resulting in gum recession or damage to tooth enamel. Plastic labret-studs are available to minimize this problem.\n\nReferences\n\nFacial piercings\nMarilyn Monroe\nMadonna (entertainer)\nde:Labret-Piercing#Madonna-Piercing", "machine_text": " A Monroe piercing is a piercing through the upper lip below the nose. It is named after the actress Marilyn Monroe, who was said to have had a Monroe piercing. How the Monroe piercing was first done is not entirely clear. The first description of a procedure very similar to the Monroe piercing is from a 1957 article in the French magazine L'Illustration. The article describes a 14-year-old girl who had a 1.5 mm hole through the left part of her upper lip, below the nose, in which she wore a tiny diamond. The article does not give the name \"Monroe piercing\" but describes the girl's piercing as \"une perçonnerie à la Marilyn Monroe\", literally \"a piercing Marilyn Monroe style\". In the early 1960s, the piercing was described in two books, both of which were about body piercing. The first book was published in Germany in 1961, the second in Italy in 1964. The Italian book was written by an author who had observed a woman with a Monroe piercing while on vacation in Egypt. The first known use of the term \"Monroe piercing\" is in a 1966 issue of the Italian magazine Gloria. The article described a piercing that was done with a needle and a thin wire. The article also gave the first known description of how a Monroe piercing is done. The first North American to get a Monroe piercing was the actress Louise Brooks, who had the piercing done in Europe during the 1960s. Brooks is often credited with bringing the piercing to North America, although there is no record of her having had the piercing done in a North American clinic. The Monroe piercing is not to be confused with a \"Cupid's bow\" or \"angel's kiss\", which is a piercing through the peak of the upper lip, or with a \"supid\", which is a single piercing through the area where the upper and lower lips meet.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 5578644}

It is nicknamed the \"Bug School\".\n\nHistory\nThe school first opened in 1975. A new facility opened around 1985. It was built as a bus barn and school for automobile mechanics, and it got the name \"pole barn\". This facility served as the high school, while K-8 classes were in a separate facility that, by November 2014, was in a better condition.\n\nCirca the 2000s the school community began advocating for a new school. In winter 2014, due to snow, a section of the roof collapsed. By 2015 the editorial board of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune advocated for an urgent replacement of the school. The editorial board cited a sewer system that fails during periods of extreme cold and periods of rodents causing infestations. Jill Burcum, the writer of the editorials, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize due to these stories.\n\nIn 2016 the United States Department of the Interior got a $12 million grant for a new school for Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig.

It is the administrative center of Yavoriv Raion and rests approximately  west of the oblast capital, Lviv. Its population is approximately .\n\nNot far from it is the watering-place of Shklo with sulfur springs.\n\nHistory\nThe town was first mentioned in written documents in 1436. It received Magdeburg rights in 1569, from Polish King Sigismund II Augustus. Jaworów was a royal town of Poland. It was a favorite residence of king John III Sobieski. In 1675 John III signed the Polish-French Treaty of Jaworów in the town, and there he also received the congratulations from the Pope on his success against the Turks at Vienna (1683).\n\nUntil the Partitions of Poland, Jaworów was an important center of commerce, located along main merchant route from Jarosław to Lwów. In 1772 it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In Galicia, it was the seat of a county, with the population of almost 11,000 (Poles, Jews, Ukrainians and Czechs).\n\nIn the immediate post-World War I period, the area of Jaworów witnessed fights of the Polish-Ukrainian War. After the war, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic, where it remained until the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in September 1939. The Jews of the village were merchants or artisans. There was a synagogue. \n\nDuring the invasion of Poland, on September 14–16, 1939, Poles defeated invading Germans in the Battle of Jaworów. Despite the victory, the town soon fell to the Soviets, and was under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941, and then under German occupation until 1944.\n\nThe Jewish population before the German occupation on June 26, 1941 was around 3000. Immediately after the Germans arrived, antisemitic Ukrainians launched a pogrom, robbing and killing Jews.  German forces took 15 Jews to a nearby forest and shot them. After that, for several months, Jews lived in their own homes but were banned on the main street and had a 6 pm curfew.  The Ukrainian police brutalized them, with beatings and some plunder and rape.  Several hundred Jews were sent to local forced labor camps.  In November 1942, German security forces, along with German and Ukrainian police, rounded up 1200 Jews, killed 200 on the spot, and sent the others to the Belzec killing camp where they were immediately murdered. A few days later, German and Ukrainian police hunted Jews in hiding and murdered about 200 at the Jewish cemetery.  After that, the Germans established a Jewish ghetto which housed about 600 Jews.  Soon after, Jews from a few neighboring villages were brought to Yavoriv bringing the ghetto population to 6000.  More than 70 people lived in each of the 80 small houses in the ghetto.  The overcrowding, starvation, and poor sanitary conditions soon led to a typhus epidemic.  After about 500 more able-bodied Jews were sent to a labor camp, on April 16, 1943, the German and Ukrainian police took more than 3500 Jews  to the Porudno forest and murdered them.  More than 2500 Jews were murdered before noon on the 16th, the rest over the next few days.  The Germans and Ukrainians burned the ghetto and searched for those in hiding.  Those found were shot.  A few were transferred to a labor camp in Lwow.  In 1944 the town was re-occupied by the Soviets, and in 1945 it was eventually annexed from Poland by the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war, the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission reported that more than 4900 people, most of them Jews, had been killed in Yavoriv, in addition to those sent to Belzec.  Only about 20 of the town's Jews were thought to have survived.\n\nNotable people\nAmong notable people born here are Władysław Langner (General of the Polish Army), Stanisław Nowakowski (president of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association), and mathematician Wawrzyniec Żmurko.\n\nGallery\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns — Sister cities\nYavoriv is twinned with:\n\nSee also\n Battle of Jaworow\n\nReferences\n\n Yavoriv, Ukraine\n Official Website Statistics\n Yavorov Jewish History\n\nCities in Lviv Oblast\nKingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria\nLwów Voivodeship\nShtetls\nCities of district significance in Ukraine\nHolocaust locations in Ukraine", "machine_text": " Yavoriv (Ukrainian: Яворів [jɑˈvoriw]) is a town in the western Ukraine, located in the Lviv region, 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Polish border and 16 km (9.9 mi) from the city of Lviv. The town is located in the historic region of Galicia. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was occupied by Russia from 27 February to 10 September, after which it was retaken by Ukraine. ## History Yavoriv was first mentioned in 1578. The first mention of the settlement as a town is found in 1646. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was owned by the Potocki family. In the second half of the 18th century, the Potockis built a palace here, which later burned down. In the interwar period, Yavoriv was part of the Lwów County of the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. In the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland, the town was captured by Germany. It was occupied by the Soviet Union in July 1941 and was not retaken by the Poles until the summer of 1944. In the winter of 1944–45, the town was a transit point for the Soviet offensive on the Baltic states. In March 1945, a hospital for wounded soldiers was set up here. After the war, the town was incorporated into the Soviet Union. From 23 November to 27 December 1967, Yavoriv was the site of the second round of the disengagement talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, at the home of the United States ambassador to the USSR, Llewellyn Thompson. The talks were led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko. The two countries discussed the crisis in the Middle East, especially the Six-Day War, which had started on 5 June 1967. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Yavoriv became part of independent Ukraine. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Yavoriv was occupied by Russia from 27 February to 10 September, after which it was retaken by Ukraine. ## Description Yavoriv is located in a picturesque area on the Roztochya hill.

She was used by the Union Navy as a ship's tender in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.\n\nAlbermarle and Lion seized by Union Navy forces \n\nOn the morning of 26 March 1862, sidewheel gunboat Delaware—during an expedition to the Pungo River in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, in search of Confederate shipping reported to be there—entered Pantego Creek and found two large schooners at its head . . . \"which,\" he reported, \"proved to be the Albemarle and Lion owned by Boyle and Richard Reddick, of Suffolk, Virginia.\"\n\nTwo armed boats from the Union warship took possession of the Southern vessels, towed them down stream, and anchored them at the mouth of the creek. Early the next morning, Delaware received on board several families who professed loyalty to the Union and asked for protection. Later that day, the gunboat and its prizes then proceeded to New Bern, North Carolina.\n\nAssigned as a store ship for Union Navy blockade ships \n\nLittle information of the prizes' movements during ensuing months seems to have survived, but Albemarle apparently remained in the North Carolina sounds. In any case, she and a schooner named Knockern were reported on 3 February 1863 to be off New Bern serving as storeships for Union forces in the sounds. On 4 May 1863, a report from Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles stated that Albemarle was still there performing in the same capacity.\n\nNorth Carolina support operations \n\nOnly five days later, the Union Navy purchased the schooner from the New York City prize court. The fact that the schooner was serving as a storeship in the sounds during the ensuing summer strongly suggests that she never left North Carolina waters but was condemned in absentia. In any case, Albemarle—commanded by Acting Assistant Paymaster Emanuel Mellach until early spring 1865 and then by Acting Assistant Paymaster George R. Watkins—served in North Carolina waters as a storeship and an ordnance hulk through the end of the Civil War.\n\nPost-war decommissioning and sale \n\nLate in July 1865, she was towed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and sold at public auction in the Norfolk Navy Yard on 19 October 1865 to a Capt. S. I. Bain. No record of her subsequent career seems to have survived.\n\nReferences \n\nShips of the Union Navy\nSchooners of the United States Navy\nTenders of the United States Navy\nAmerican Civil War auxiliary ships of the United States\n1863 ships", "machine_text": " USS Albemarle (1863) The USS Albemarle was a single-turreted, iron-hulled, riverine monitor of the United States Navy, named for the Battle of Albemarle Sound during the American Civil War. The monitor's design was based on that of the USS Montauk, the first of the Monitor class to be laid down. Like the Montauk, the Albemarle was designed to operate in the shallower waters of the rivers and Sounds of the Carolinas, where the larger ocean-going monitors could not maneuver effectively. The Albemarle had a shallower draft than the Montauk, with a much lighter armament and a correspondingly lighter armor protection. The Albemarle was the first monitor to be equipped with a Hotchkiss revolving cannon. The Albemarle was laid down in 1862 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 22 January 1863; and commissioned on 4 February 1864, with Commander George S. Blake in command. The Albemarle's first assignment was to support the Navy's effort to take the city of Fort Fisher, which was the last major port open to the Confederacy on the Atlantic Ocean. The Albemarle arrived at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in mid-January 1865, after the first battle for Fort Fisher, and helped to bottle up the fort and reduce its supplies and effectiveness. The Albemarle was heavily involved in the second battle for Fort Fisher, on 15 January 1865, providing fire support for the naval attack. The Albemarle was hit multiple times by Confederate artillery, but suffered no casualties or serious damage. After the second battle, the Albemarle, along with most of the other Union monitors, was sent to the James River in Virginia to support the final assault on the city of Richmond. The Albemarle arrived in the James River in early April 1865, just before the Lee's army evacuated the city. The Albemarle was one of the first Union warships to enter the city, and helped to accept the surrender of the city from Confederate authorities. The Albemarle was involved in the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, providing assistance to the Montauk, which had been ordered to transport the body of Lincoln to the capital. The Albemarle was decommissioned in May 1865, and placed in the James River reserve fleet. The Albemarle was never reactivated, and was eventually sunk to be used as a breakwater in the Delaware River in the 1870s.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 14280995}

She was the wife of 34th President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and First Lady of her country between January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002. She too was a Ph.D in anthropology from the University of São Paulo.\n\nAs professor and researcher Cardoso taught at the Latin American College of Social Sciences (Flacso/Unesco), University of Chile (Santiago), Maison des Sciences de L'Homme (Paris), University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University (New York City). She was an associate member of the Center for Latin American Studies of the University of Cambridge. With her husband, the sociologist and former president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  she founded and later directed the research institute Cebrap (Centro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento – Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning), which continues to be a leading site of social science research in Brazil.\n\nDr. Cardoso’s academic reputation rests primarily on a series of highly influential articles and book chapters on popular movements and political participation that she published in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil’s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the \"new\" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties.\n\nUnlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solidária (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solidária also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program.  She published a book about these experiences,  Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office.\n\nShe died in São Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest.

One feature for 1997 was known as 'Inside F1' where a driver would demonstrate a certain piece of equipment on a Formula One car and would summarise what operations the equipment performed along with its effects. There was also a track guide using a computer simulation provided by Psygnosis also for 1997. The post-race qualifying and race coverage was mainly a discussion between the presenter and the experts going over the key facts of what occurred. In the same year, Simon Taylor was left unable to broadcast live after feeling seasick during the Monaco Grand Prix when the team were presenting on a yacht that kept moving around. Sometimes the presenters hosted from the ITV studios for the Asian races due to costs of travelling.\n\nIn the early years, ITV also showed Murray & Martin's F1 Special, which usually aired on Saturday teatimes at each Grand Prix weekend. Introduced by Murray Walker and Martin Brundle, the programmes featured detailed reports on the day's qualifying session, along with interviews and features with the drivers and team personnel. The programme was slowly phased out in 1999, with fewer specials airing, before being dropped altogether at the end of 2000.\n\nITV also introduced Martin Brundle's hugely popular gridwalk at the 1997 British Grand Prix, where roughly 10–15 minutes before the start of the race Brundle would walk around the grid interviewing drivers, team personnel, celebrities and whoever else he could find. Brundle had elected not to commentate from some races such as the Canadian Grand Prix in 1997 where he raced at Le Mans and missed the race in 1998. He also elected not to attend the Hungarian Grand Prix on several occasions. When Brundle was absent, different people would stand in the commentary booth, including Derek Warwick, Jody Scheckter, Anthony Davidson and 1996 champion Damon Hill.\n\nITV were not able to show the qualifying for the 1999 French Grand Prix due to a dispute with Formula One Management. FOM President Bernie Ecclestone asked ITV if they wanted live coverage with the broadcaster refusing stating they would show coverage at a later time. Ecclestone apologised in the Sunday Express and the race coverage was unaffected.\n\nIn a one-off move for the return of the United States Grand Prix in 2000, ITV moved the coverage over to ITV2 as the schedule of the main channel could not occupy the coverage of the race.\n\nThe 2001 United States Grand Prix was Murray Walker's last in the ITV commentary booth, having missed four other races that season. James Allen moved up from his former role as pitlane reporter to replace Walker in the commentary box with Brundle still commentating as usual and Ted Kravitz inheriting Allen's old role.\n\nIn October 2002, the BBC had prepared pay £175 million to gain the rights off ITV when their contract was to expire at the end of 2004. In April 2004, ITV signed a six-year extension to their contract worth £150 million. In that same year, the coverage dropped its trackside studio and the presenters and analysts provided the coverage directly from within the paddock, allowing them to be at every race location for the first time – in previous years, for certain races, particularly for those held in Asia, the trackside studio was based in London, using satellite link-up to broadcast the race. With the advent of new anti-tobacco advertising laws in the United Kingdom that were placed in force on 31 July 2005, it was feared that Formula One coverage would be blacked out because with the showing of tobacco company logos on television, the broadcaster would face extra charges even in a country where tobacco sponsorship was permitted. ITV  was the UK's live   television broadcaster at the time of  one of F1's most controversial races in the form of the farcical 2005 United States Grand Prix  at which 7 of the 10  planned team entrants on Michelin tyres withdrew on the formation lap due to tyre safety concerns leaving just 3 teams using Bridgestone tyres (Minardi, Jordan and Ferrari (6 cars) to compete in the race. In September 2005, it was reported that ITV had secured Steve Rider's services and would replace Rosenthal from 2006 onwards to present coverage of Formula One. Rider made his debut broadcast covering ITV F1 coverage at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\nITV extended their contract with North One Television for a further five years in an agreement that started at the first round of the 2006 season and would produce over 100 hours of content which also included qualifying and the highlight shows. ITV were the host broadcasters for the British Grand Prix.\n\nIn March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season so that the broadcaster could focus more on coverage on the UEFA Champions League. The contract to show the sport at the time of announcement was worth £25 million. ITV later announced that they had enacted a clause within their contract enabling them to leave F1 coverage after the 2008 season.\n\nIronically, ITV F1's highest ever broadcast rating came in its final race, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, which attracted 8.8 million viewers, peaking at 12.5 million viewers and saw Lewis Hamilton win his first Formula One Drivers' World Championship title. On 17 November 2008, BBC announced that Martin Brundle would continue his commentary role alongside Jonathan Legard during the 2009 season, while Ted Kravitz would continue his pit-lane reporter role alongside Lee McKenzie.\n\nFeatures\n\nTheme music\nITV's F1 coverage used five different themes throughout its lifespan. The first theme was a special, untitled, track performed by Jamiroquai which lasted from 1997 to 1999. This theme was commissioned in February 1997 and cost £100,000 to compose. Neil Duncanson, who worked for Chrysalis Sport and was ITV-F1's producer, was a friend of frontman Jay Kay, who is a fan of Formula One.\n\nIn 2000, Jamiroquai's theme was replaced by \"Blackbeat\" by Apollo 440 which lasted until 2002, replaced the following year by a remixed version by Arnon Woolfson of \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" by Bachman–Turner Overdrive. Throughout 2004, ITV incorporated the song \"Catch Me If You Can\" which was written specifically for the programme by Woolfson and performed by singer-songwriter Louise Griffiths, who at the time was engaged to BAR driver Jenson Button. The final theme was \"Lift Me Up\" by Moby which ran from 2006 until 2008.\n\nWebsite\nThe ITV-F1 website was launched in March 1998 as a joint venture between ITV, F1 Racing and Business Net at a cost of £700,000 for the year. Initial content was provided by F1 Racing with news updates from Murray Walker and Martin Brundle. The site was revamped in July 1999 with the addition of a superstore selling Formula One merchandise along with a multimedia content area and a loyalty club. The website was closed in January 2012 citing the joint televised deal between the BBC and Sky as the reason.\n\nSponsorship\nBetween 1997 and 2001, ITV's coverage was sponsored by Texaco, who outbid RAC in December 1996. For the first year, the sponsorship promotion was created by Steve Pickard and directed by David Harris who were both from IMP. The sponsorship credits were based upon the speed and excitement of a Formula One team refuelling one of their racing cars with a circular theme involving the Texaco logo. Texaco placed £12 million in the first three years of their contract with ITV. The credits were directed by Darryl Goodrich and produced by Nicolas Unsworth.\n\nIn September 2001, Toyota signed a four-year deal worth £25 million seeing off competition from Fosters, who previously sponsored the ITV-F1 website. The car manufacturer pulled out at the end of 2003 to focus on brand advertising. The Daily Telegraph signed a one-year £4.5 million deal to take over the sponsorship in 2004. In 2005, LG took over the sponsorship with a £3.5 million contract for a year. Their sponsorship included the promotion of the LG Mobile brand among the aim for younger viewers to watch the programming.\n\nFor a period in 2006, Swiftcover.com sponsored the coverage from that year's San Marino Grand Prix. The screening of their sponsorship included Formula One drivers who were frustrated whilst speaking over the team radio to chickens in the pit lane. For 2007, Honda took over as the main sponsor which also included Honda's logo being placed onto the ITV-F1 website with the aim to attract younger viewers. The idents for Honda's sponsorship were produced by Honda's creative agency Wieden and Kennedy which built upon the car manufacturers indisputable passion for motor racing.\n\nFor 2008, Sony signed a deal that was negotiated by OMD UK as the final sponsor of the network's coverage. The amount of sponsorship money was unpublished but was thought to be around £5 million. The idents were developed by fallon with digital and mobile assets developed by Dare.\n\nScheduling\nAll races were broadcast live with occasional reruns in races where the start time was considered early for fans who had elected not to watch at an earlier time. Originally, qualifying sessions for races held in North America were not shown live and were instead screened as delayed coverage, usually beginning at 11:00pm. From 2005, these sessions were shown live, but on ITV2 and ITV3 and in 2006 and 2007 the sessions were screened live on ITV3 and ITV4, with it being repeated on ITV1 later that night. In 2008, all qualifying sessions were screened live on ITV1.\n\nWhen qualifying was split into two sessions from 2003, ITV1 broadcast the Friday session as delayed coverage in a late night slot, usually at around midnight, except for the British Grand Prix, in which the Friday session was shown live. The Saturday session was broadcast live as normal. In 2004, when both qualifying sessions were held on Saturday, only the second session was shown live, with only brief highlights from the first session shown in the build-up. When qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix that year was postponed to Sunday owing to a typhoon alert, neither session was shown live. For 2005, when qualifying was split into a Saturday–Sunday format, only the Saturday session was shown live, with brief highlights of the Sunday session shown in the race build-up. This format proved unpopular with fans and was scrapped following the first six races that year, with qualifying for the rest of that year reverting to just a single one-lap session on Saturday.\n\nThe highlights programme lasted for one hour and would normally have started at around 11:35pm depending on the schedule.\n\nProduction\nITV's coverage was originally produced by Mach 1 Productions from 1997 to 1999. In 2000, production was taken over by Chrysalis Sport in association with United Productions. Prior to the start of the 2002 season, United Productions was taken over by Granada Media, making the coverage a Chrysalis/Granada co-production. Chrysalis became North One Television in 2004, which continued to co-produce the coverage with Granada until the end of 2005, before becoming the sole production company from 2006.\n\nAwards\nITV were awarded three consecutive BAFTA awards for the Best Sports Programme for their coverage of the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix, 2007 Canadian Grand Prix and the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nCriticism\n\nShowing of advertisements\nA major criticism of ITV's coverage was they were permitted to show advertisements during the coverage which promoted a number of complaints from viewers. Many key events in races were not shown as live as a result over the years of the coverage, some of these included: Damon Hill overtaking Michael Schumacher for the race lead at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix (where he eventually finished second due to a hydraulic failure), Schumacher's retirement at the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix which handed the drivers' championship to Mika Hakkinen, Schumacher's crash at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix, Schumacher's engine failures at the 2000 French Grand Prix and 2006 Japanese Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso's engine failure at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton's gearbox troubles at the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix which cost him the championship to Kimi Räikkönen, and Räikkönen's engine failure at the 2008 European Grand Prix.\n\nThe most serious incident however occurred at the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix when the broadcaster cut to a commercial break during the closing moments of the race which garnered 126 complaints from viewers. Ofcom ruled that ITV breached section 6.7 of the Rules on the Amount and Scheduling of Advertising. The broadcasters also had not shown the post-race press conference segment featuring Jenson Button's comments about the race. ITV repeated the last three laps after the race and as a result of these complaints, the server on their website crashed. An on-air apology was made by Jim Rosenthal before the start of the next race in Spain two weeks later.\n\nCoverage\nMany fans of the sport criticised the coverage of the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix when the programme had ended just after the race concluded. ITV made arrangements for the next race that if coverage overran, the show would continue to be shown on ITV4.\n\nCompetition\nIn 2009, Ofcom ruled that ITV's handling of the competition for their last race broadcast had broken competition rules when 139,000 viewers rang a premium phone line charging £1 for a chance of winning the prize. The competition organiser Eckoh was not overseen by the broadcaster. In July 2009, ITV awarded the winner of the competition the prize that was not awarded because the winner's name was not published at the required time.\n\nLegacy\nITV's F1 coverage helped to pave the way on how motor sport would be broadcast in the modern era. Many of the features such as Martin Brundle's gridwalk and the pre- and post-race analysis were all transferred when the coverage returned to the BBC.\n\nSee also\n Grand Prix – The BBC's Formula One programme from 1978 to 1996 and from 2009 to 2015\n Sky Sports F1 – Sky's television channel created for coverage of Formula One since 2012\n Channel 4 F1 – Channel 4's coverage of Formula One since 2016\n Sports broadcasting contracts in the United Kingdom\n Broadcasting of sports events\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\n1997 British television series debuts\n2008 British television series endings\n1990s British sports television series\n2000s British sports television series\nFormula One mass media\nITV (TV network) original programming\nITV Sport\nTelevision series by All3Media\nEnglish-language television shows", "machine_text": " ITV F1 Coverage ITV began its coverage of Formula One in 1996, and covered the sport for four years.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Representation theory of the symmetric group\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.\n\nThe symmetric group Sn has order n!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of n. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of n. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of n or equivalently Young diagrams of size n.\n\nEach such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram. The dimension  of the representation that corresponds to the Young diagram  is given by the hook length formula.\n\nTo each irreducible representation ρ we can associate an irreducible character, χρ.\nTo compute χρ(π) where π is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial Murnaghan–Nakayama rule\n. Note that χρ is constant on conjugacy classes,\nthat is, χρ(π) = χρ(σ−1πσ) for all permutations σ.\n\nOver other fields the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field K has characteristic equal to zero or greater than n then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra KSn is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\n\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called Specht modules, and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.\n\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\n\nLow-dimensional representations\n\nSymmetric groups \nThe lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, as done in .  This work was extended to the smallest k degrees (explicitly for , and ) in , and over arbitrary fields in .  The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:\n\nEvery symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the trivial representation, where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix.  For , there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the sign representation or alternating character, which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry ±1 based on the sign of the permutation.  These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the abelianization of the symmetric group is C2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nFor all n, there is an n-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order n!, called the , which consists of permuting n coordinates.  This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal.  The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when , the representation on this subspace is an -dimensional irreducible representation, called the standard representation.  Another -dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation. An exterior power  of the standard representation  is irreducible provided  .\n\nFor , these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of Sn – all other irreducible representations have dimension at least n.  However for , the surjection from S4 to S3 allows S4 to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation.  For , the exceptional transitive embedding of S5 into S6 produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.\n\nAlternating groups \n\nThe representation theory of the alternating groups is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For , the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the -dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller n.\n\nThe alternating groups for  have only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation.  For  there are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order 3:  and .\n\n For , there is just one irreducible representation of degree , and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.\n For  the obvious analogue of the -dimensional representation is reducible – the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, as  is abelian; see the discrete Fourier transform for representation theory of cyclic groups.\n For , there is just one  irreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension 1.\n For , there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as icosahedral symmetry.\n For , there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of A5 in A6.\n\nTensor products of representations\n\nKronecker coefficients\n\nThe tensor product of two representations of  corresponding to the Young diagrams  is a combination of irreducible representations of ,\n\nThe coefficients  are called the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group.\nThey can be computed from the characters of the representations :\n\nThe sum is over partitions  of , with  the corresponding conjugacy classes. The values of the characters  can be computed using the Frobenius formula. The coefficients  are\n\nwhere  is the number of times  appears in , so that .\n\nA few examples, written in terms of Young diagrams :\n\nThere is a simple rule for computing  for any Young diagram  : the result is the sum of all Young diagrams that are obtained from  by removing one box and then adding one box, where the coefficients are one except for  itself, whose coefficient is , i.e., the number of different row lengths minus one.\n\nA constraint on the irreducible constituents of  is \n\nwhere the depth  of a Young diagram is the number of boxes that do not belong to the first row.\n\nReduced Kronecker coefficients\nFor  a Young diagram and ,  is a Young diagram of size . Then  is a bounded, non-decreasing function of , and \n\nis called a reduced Kronecker coefficient or stable Kronecker coefficient. There are known bounds on the value of  where  reaches its limit. The reduced Kronecker coefficients are structure constants of Deligne categories of representations of  with . \n\nIn contrast to Kronecker coefficients, reduced Kronecker coefficients are defined for any triple of Young diagrams, not necessarily of the same size. If , then  coincides with the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient . Reduced Kronecker coefficients can be written as linear combinations of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients via a change of bases in the space of symmetric functions, giving rise to expressions that are manifestly integral although not manifestly positive. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can also be written in terms of Kronecker and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients   via Littlewood's formula\n\nConversely, it is possible to recover the Kronecker coefficients as linear combinations of reduced Kronecker coefficients.\n\nReduced Kronecker coefficients are implemented in the computer algebra system SageMath.\n\nEigenvalues of complex representations\n\nGiven an element  of cycle-type  and order , the eigenvalues of  in a complex representation of  are of the type  with , where the integers  are called the cyclic exponents of  with respect to the representation.\n\nThere is a combinatorial description of the cyclic exponents of the symmetric group (and wreath products thereof).

This gives rise to a representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is a group, this representation is linear. We can regard this representation as a restriction of the representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$. The symmetric group $S_n$ also acts on the complex field $\\mathbb{C}$ by permuting the complex numbers. This gives rise to a representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$. For any $n \\geq 1$, the representations $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ and $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ are not isomorphic. This follows from the fact that $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is a complex representation, while $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is a real representation. The representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is the easiest symmetric group representation to understand. It is also the most important. For any $n \\geq 1$, this representation is a group homomorphism, that is, it is injective. This follows from the fact that $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is a group. This representation is also surjective. That is, for any $A \\in \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$, there exists $\\sigma \\in S_n$ such that $A = \\sigma \\in S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$. To see this, we need to exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the symmetric group and the complex upper triangular matrices. Consider the set $\\mathcal{A}$ of all upper triangular matrices with diagonal $1$. This is clearly a subset of $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$. We claim that $\\mathcal{A}$ is equal to the set of all symmetric group permutations $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma(e_i)=e_i$ for all $i$, where $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$ are the standard basis vectors. To see this, first note that any symmetric group permutation $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma(e_i)=e_i$ for all $i$ can be obtained by composing the following two permutations: (i) the permutation $e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_i,e_i+1,e_i+2,\\ldots,e_n$; (ii) the permutation $e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_i,e_i+1,e_i+2,\\ldots,e_n,e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_i,e_i+1,e_i+2,\\ldots,e_n$. The inverse of this symmetric group permutation $\\sigma$ is given by (i) followed by (ii) composed with the inverse of (ii). It is easy to check that this is a bijection. We can now regard the symmetric group representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ as a restriction of the representation $S_n \\to \\mathcal{A}$. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ is a group, this representation is linear. We can regard this representation as a restriction of the representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$. This representation is not an isomorphism. This follows from the fact that $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is a real representation, while $\\mathcal{A}$ is a complex representation. In general, representations of $S_n$ that are not isomorphic to the representation $S_n \\to \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})$ can be constructed as follows.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tōgō Onsen\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Tōgō Onsen (東郷温泉) is an onsen in the town of Yurihama in Tottori Prefecture, Japan. It was the second most popular onsen area in Tottori Prefecture during the beginning of the Shōwa era.\n\nHot spring type\nTōgō Onsen is classified as a chloride and sulfate type hot spring, with a spring source temperature of 85 to 94 degrees Celsius.\n\nTōgō Onsen’s hot spring waters can be found near Matsuzaki station. Here, there is a 300-meter deep cavity in the layer of granite bedrock. This cavity is filled in with conglomerate sedimentary rock, called the Oshikagawa pyroclastic layer, along with diluvium and alluvium layers on top of it. Tōgō Onsen’s water originates from the granite, Oshikagawa, and diluvium layers, and its heat source is thought to be waste heat from the granite layer.\n\nDescription\nThere is a large multipurpose health resort at the edge of Tōgō Lake. Nearby is Japan’s largest Chinese garden, Enchō-en. The main hot spring resort area is to the east, where several Japanese ryokan inns operated up until and during Shōwa period. Currently, only two establishments, Yōshōkan and the town-managed Suimeisō, are in operation. Hot spring water flows out of the central part of the lake, causing steam to hang over its surface.\n\nThere are two ashiyu footbaths in the area, which are free for anyone to use. At Tōgō-Hawai Seaside Park, there is a hot water fountain that can be used to create boiled eggs, known as onsen tamago. The other footbath is at Lake Tōgō Lakeside Park, which also has a station for making onsen tamago. According to figures reported by the local government, Tōgō Onsen reached its peak number of visitors from the early to mid-1970’s, with more than 350,000 visitors per year. In contrast, most other hot spring areas within Tottori Prefecture reached their peak visitor count from the late 1980’s to 1993.\n\nHistory\nThe existence of the hot spring was referenced in a document written in 1749. At the time, hot spring water was drawn out by bamboo tubes inserted into the bottom of the lake, in conjunction with bamboo gates. Other documents show that the residents of Kami-Asozu village in modern-day Yurihama received permission from the Tottori Domain to draw water from the hot spring in 1843; during the Ansei Period, the hot spring water was used to treat low back pain.\n\nThe origins of Tōgō Onsen\n\nUse of the hot springs for bathing began in 1868, at the start of the Meiji Period; in 1872, a large bath tub was constructed on Ryūyu-tō Island, which was located on the lake. A wealthy local farmer created a well for drawing spring water on the western bank of Tōgō River, as well as a separate building called the Yōshōkan, and gave access to the villagers. In 1884, this building began operating as a ryokan business. With the opening of the San'in Main Line and Matsuzaki station at the end of the Meiji Period, the number of yearly visitors reached 10,000 and the name Tōgō Onsen was given to the area. Japanese novelist Naoya Shiga once visited the Yōshōkan, and he mentions it in his short story collection Tottori. The Yōshōkan is still operating today.\n\nThe origins of Matsuzaki Onsen\nAt the start of the Taishō period, other areas near Matsuzaki station experienced an increase in onsen excavation. Around this time, many books about travel such as Japanese novelist Katai Tayama’s Nihon Isshū  (“A trip round Japan”) were being published, and public interest towards domestic travel was growing. Scientific surveys for onsen were also being conducted; this led to the discovery of a new hot spring source during the late Taishō period, located near Matsuzaki station in Tōgō River. As a result, many new inns were built. These inns became collectively known as “Matsuzaki Onsen”, and soon the names Tōgō Onsen and Matsuzaki Onsen began to appear in documents.\n\nConsolidation into Tōgō Onsen\nSoon after Matsuzaki Onsen was created, it was formed into an association with Tōgō Onsen. According to the Nihon onsen taikan (Japan Onsen Encyclopedia) published in 1939, the total number of yearly lodging guests to the association’s seven inns at the time was 62,000. This made it the second most-visited onsen district in Tottori Prefecture, following Misasa Onsen’s 80,000 guests per year to its 20 inns.\nDuring the Edo Period, the narrow lakeshore on the eastern bank of the Tōgō River was a strategically important location for military and transportation purposes, so there was a lodge there. During the Meiji Period, the area had grown to become Matsuzaki Village, and had its own local government. Similarly, Tōgō Onsen and the surrounding areas formed Tōgō Village. In 1951, Matsuzaki Village and Tōgō Village merged to become Tōgō-Matsuzaki Town; in 1953, this entity merged with surrounding villages to form Tōgō Town. After this, the names of the hot springs were consolidated into “Tōgō Onsen”.\n\nFrom the Meiji Period to the Shōwa Period, many famous people visited Tōgō Onsen, such as politicians Shigenobu Ōkuma, Shinpei Gotō, Yukio Ozaki, and Hiroshi Shimomura. Besides the aforementioned Katai Tayama and Naoya Shiga, writers such as Lafcadio Hearn, Shungetsu Ikuta, Rohan Kōda, and others have also visited.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Hawai- Tōgō Hot Spring and Ryokan Association\n Tōgō Yu-asis Ryūhōkaku\n\nHot springs of Japan\nPublic baths in Japan\nTourist attractions in Tottori Prefecture", "machine_text": " Tōgō Onsen Tōgō Onsen (東郷温泉) is a hot spring resort in the city of Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The resort is located in the Tsugaru region of Aomori Prefecture, on the eastern edge of the Hakkōda Mountains. The hot springs are one of the more famous hot spring resorts in the region, and are one of the few that are easily accessible by a paved road. The hot springs are located along the cottony dogwood tree-lined Towada-Hachimantai National Highway. There are many onsen ryokan in the area. The sulfur springs are colored in shades of green and are said to be good for skin ailments. In the past, the springs were located along the road, but due to their popularity, most of the springs have been developed into bathhouses and ryokan. The springs are still considered to be one of the best free hot springs in the region. The springs can be found by following the road to the end, where there is a large bathhouse, the Sakuraya Bathhouse, which is free to enter. The bathhouse has a strong sulfur smell, but the water is clear. The temperature is very hot, reaching above 50 degrees Celsius. The resort is also known for its \"onsen eggs\", a local specialty in which eggs are hard-boiled in the hot spring water. The sulfur in the water turns the egg shells black, and the egg whites turn a light green. Onsen eggs are a popular local tourist souvenir, and can be found at many tourist shops in the area.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ramos de Azevedo\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Francisco de Paula Ramos de Azevedo (8 December 1851 — 13 June 1928) was a Brazilian architect, known for designing various buildings and landmarks in São Paulo, such as the Teatro Municipal, the Mercado Municipal and the Pinacoteca. He was one of the founders and director of the University of São Paulo's Polytechnical School.\n\nBiography\n\nRamos de Azevedo was born in São Paulo, from a wealthy family coming from Campinas. In 1878, he went to Ghent, Belgium, to study civil engineering at the École Speciale du Génie Civil et des Arts et Manufactures. According to his biographers, however, it is said that the director of the School of Architecture course was surprised by the quality of his work and ordered him to change his career. At school he studied classical architecture, but was influenced to follow the propositions of architectural eclecticism. He graduated in this course in 1886.\n\nBack to Brazil, Ramos de Azevedo established himself in Campinas and there performed his first projects. He was responsible for the completion of construction of the city's cathedral, the first of his great works.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century he was invited to design the homes of some members of the São Paulo elite. Ramos de Azevedo decided to establish in São Paulo a technical office, which took its name, which soon became the main influencer of the local architecture.\n\nTogether with a group of São Paulo aristocrats linked to progressive political currents, Ramos de Azevedo founded the Polytechnic School, establishing the school a model similar to that experienced in Europe. Its link with education also happened when he became director of the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios of São Paulo, where he promoted an educational reform that would make the school self-sufficient and recognized throughout the country.\n\nBecause of the importance of his work for the city of São Paulo, a monument in his honor was built in front of the Liceu's building, in the Tiradentes Avenue. Because of the subway works in the 1970s, this monument was moved to the campus of the University of São Paulo, and is currently at Praça Ramos de Azevedo, in front of the Polytechnic School.\n\nList of notable projects\n\nHospital Psiquiátrico do Juqueri (1895–98)\nTeatro Municipal de São Paulo (1903–11) \nSão Paulo state pavilion at Exhibition of the centenary of the opening of the Ports of Brazil (1908)\nEscola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (1893) \nPalácio das Indústrias (1920s)\nCemitério da Consolação (fronton) (1870)\nFazenda Pau d'Alho (1920s) \nColégio Técnico de Campinas (1920)\nMuseu Casa das Rosas\nColégio Politécnico Bento Quirino (1920s) \nColégio Sion (1920s) \nPinacoteca de São Paulo (1893) \nPalácio dos Correios (1920s) \nCatedral Metropolitana de Campinas (Anos 1880) \nMercado Municipal de Campinas (1902) \nMunicipal Market of São Paulo (1928) \nFaculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (1905)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Ramos de Azevedo at Itaú Cultural (in Portuguese)\n\nBrazilian architects\nPeople from São Paulo\n1851 births\n1928 deaths", "machine_text": " Ramos de Azevedo is a municipality in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Faith Newman\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Faith Newman is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network. She is currently portrayed by Reylynn Caster, who assumed the role following the departure of Alyvia Alyn Lind, who played Faith for almost ten years from 2011 to 2021. Introduced during the September 30, 2009, episode, Faith is the youngest daughter of supercouple Nick and Sharon Newman.\n\nStorylines\nFaith is conceived during an affair between Sharon Abbott (Sharon Case) and Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow). Her paternity is initially in question, with Nick, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) as the possible fathers; a paternity test confirms Nick as Faith's father. Moments after Sharon gives birth to Faith while institutionalized at Fairview Sanitarium, she is kidnapped by Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), who passes her off as Ashley Abbott's (Eileen Davidson) child and leads Sharon to believe her baby died. Adam's deceit is revealed months later, after Sharon had befriended and married him, and Faith is reunited with her biological parents. Sharon and Faith become trapped in a barn during a tornado, and when the barn's beams start to collapse, Adam saves Faith's life by shielding her from the falling beams. Nick later deems Sharon an unfit mother due to her continued involvement with Adam, and successfully obtains full custody of Faith. Sharon is presumed dead after going on the run from the police, having been falsely convicted for the murder of Skye Newman (Laura Stone). After being found alive, Sharon is sentenced to thirty years in prison. Ashley offers to watch Faith several times for Nick, which brings the two of them closer. Faith's brother Noah Newman (Robert Adamson) encourages Nick to bring Faith to visit Sharon in prison, which he reluctantly agrees to do. Sharon reunites with Faith after she is acquitted, and they go to New Mexico together on vacation. \n\nSharon suffers a nervous breakdown and is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, leaving Nick as Faith's sole carer for several months. The following year, Sharon takes advantage of Faith's disapproval of Nick's girlfriend (and eventual fiancée) Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins), in hopes of undermining Nick and Avery's relationship. Meanwhile, Faith forms a bond with Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), who turns out to be Nick's half-brother. Nick and Sharon become engaged again, and Faith meets her sister, Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes). The engagement ends when Nick learns that Sharon (while off her medication) had tampered with a DNA test and led him to believe that he was not the father of Summer Newman (Hunter King). Another custody dispute ensues between Nick and Sharon, with Nick using Sharon's mental health struggles to win full custody of Faith. After reverting to joint custody, their relationship turns hostile again when it is revealed that Sharon had been raising what was believed to be Nick's son, Christian Newman (Jamie and Alister Tobias), as her own child with Dylan. Faith runs away from home due to the conflict between her parents. When presented with the chance to return to her parent's shared custody arrangement, Faith rejects both of them, deciding to live with her grandparents instead. The following year, Faith grows resentful at Nick's new relationship with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan). She also witnesses Sharon's boyfriend Scotty Grainger (Daniel Hall) kissing her aunt Abby Newman (Melissa Ordway). \n\nFaith moves away from Genoa City to attend boarding school. Upon returning, she learns that Sharon has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and begins to misbehave at school. After a story about Adam's criminal history is published, which discloses Faith's kidnapping to the public, Faith is cyber-bullied. She befriends Jordan (Madison Thompson) who influences her to drink while underage. Faith learns that Jordan had been sending her text messages as a secret admirer named Tommy. Faith then takes off in a truck, which she ends up crashing; Adam finds Faith and brings her to the hospital. When Faith is diagnosed with acute interstitial nephritis and requires a kidney transplant, Adam is found to be a match for Faith's rare blood type, and donates his kidney to her.\n\nDevelopment\n\nCasting and creation\n\nThe character was introduced on September 30, 2009. As an infant, Faith was played by the Lutsky twins from 2009 to 2011. Beginning 2011, child actress Alyvia Alyn Lind, the daughter of American actress Barbara Alyn Woods, stepped into the role of Faith at the age of three. In June 2013, due to schedule conflicts, the role was recast with Mckenna Grace. Sharon Case, who plays Faith's mother Sharon Newman, described Grace as \"not nervous at all,\" noting her to be \"very confident\" with a \"big personality\". In May 2014, Lind returned to the role. In December 2014, Grace started temporarily filling in for Lind, while Lind was filming a pilot for TNT. \n\nLind continued taking breaks from playing Faith over the years due to other projects, while stating in 2020: \"There was one point when I was going off for some movie and by the time I was finished with that, we weren’t positive I would come back to Y&R and it was seriously the hardest thing for me to take. I just couldn’t imagine leaving this family.\" Lind added her role on the soap opera was \"the most stable thing\" in her life. The character was said to be attending boarding school while Lind was absent for several months before returning in December 2019. \n\nIn March 2021, it was announced Lind was departing The Young and the Restless after being cast in a leading role on the television series Chucky. This left the series' producers in a \"casting conundrum,\" due to Faith being a \"pivotal character in a front-burner storyline\" at the time. Lind's final episode aired on April 7, 2021, and she was replaced by actress Reylynn Caster, who took over the role on April 12, 2021. Caster's casting marked the first time Faith appears at \"an adult-ish age\". Caster thought that it was good for her to be \"thrown into such a big storyline\", stating that: \"I had to force myself to get adjusted to everything quickly instead of gradually.\" Caster added portraying Faith \"in this really scary point of her life\" allowed her to connect with the character quickly.\n\nChildhood\n \n\nFaith has been described as an \"outspoken girl\" who \"has always had something to say about the new loves in her parents’ lives\". As a child, she has particular disdain for the women her father Nick (Joshua Morrow) is involved with. Soap Opera Digest highlighted the character's \"precociousness\" as being evident from a very young age. Of the character, Lind has stated: \"She’s had a tough life, but she’s always been surrounded by a supporting, loving family. And because of that love, she has always been a survivor.\" Faith's birth was prophesied by her older sister, Cassie (Camryn Grimes), on her deathbed. Given this, Sharon Case (Sharon) has characterized Faith as an \"oracle-type character. She's an old soul, as Cassie was.\" \n\nThroughout her childhood, Faith is the subject of a recurring custody dispute between her parents. As a result of Sharon's romantic involvement with Faith's kidnapper and uncle Adam Newman (then played by Michael Muhney), Nick deemed himself best-suited for custody. Faith has a strong connection with her grandfather Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), and at one point, opts to live with her grandparents due to her parents' custody war. Lind explained that Faith \"realized that she had the power\" in the scenes where she chooses to live with her grandparents, contrasting this with the usual writing for child characters: \"Usually, in a scene with kids, writers are like, 'Have the kid come in, say, 'Hi, Mommy,' and then run out the door.' I’m so grateful to the writers because they always give me fun and cool storylines and make Faith seem wise beyond her years.\" According to Case, the decision to make Faith \"very wise\" was informed by the writers watching Lind.\n\nTeenage angst\nIn 2020, Faith's kidnapping as a newborn by her uncle Adam (Mark Grossman) is revealed to the public, causing her to be cyber-bullied. Meanwhile, an older teen and \"bad influence\" Jordan (Madison Thompson) inspires Faith to sneak out to parties and drink. Lind stated that \"Faith is turning into quite the delinquent\", noting that she enjoyed playing Faith's rebellious side as the character had \"always been a kind of goody two-shoes, so it’s great to play her dealing with becoming a teenager. She’s been going through a lot of stuff, although that doesn’t give her a pass to act out like she’s doing, but it’s really reflecting her pain.\" Canyon News noted that Faith was \"spiraling\" and \"not so innocent anymore\".\n\nHead writer Josh Griffith noted that Faith's behavior worsens as she deals with the trauma of the bullying as well as Sharon's cancer diagnosis the previous year. Speaking of Faith's underage drinking, Lind thanked the writers for giving her \"such a great storyline\" and stated: \"Nobody’s perfect and I loved being able to explore Faith’s dark side. And I’m not sure what’s in store for Faith, but I will always believe that deep down, she’s a good person with a good heart. She just strayed off her path for a beat.\" During this period, Faith opens up about her alcoholism to her grandmother Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott), due to the latter's own struggles with alcohol. After agreeing to receive help for her issues, Faith learns that the \"mysterious texts\" she had been receiving from a male admirer were actually from Jordan, who had been catfishing Faith in an effort to publicly humiliate her. In response, Faith runs off with alcohol and becomes involved in a car accident that \"eerily\" mirrors the fatal car crash that killed Cassie. Scott observed that \"all of Faith’s parental figures feel a certain degree of helplessness. Since this form of bullying [catfishing] didn’t exist when they were young, it’s not something that most adults feel they can protect their children from.\" Scott added that the series was using the storyline to alert parents to the dangers of modern forms of bullying. \n\nAfter Caster takes over the role, Faith displays her \"forceful side\" when she rejects Jordan's apology for the bullying. During this storyline, Faith forms a friendship with Moses Winters (Jacob Aaron Gaines), who defends her against bullies at school. Gaines explained that Moses has a \"soft spot\" for Faith and \"won't let anyone push her around\", with Canyon News highlighting a possible romance building between the two. Meanwhile, Caster described the twist in which Adam saves Faith's life twice, including by donating his kidney to her, as \"very complicated\" due to Faith's history with Adam. Caster stated that Faith \"feels like she kind of owes him redemption. But also, she's a teenage girl who is still trying to figure out everything\", describing Faith's relationship with Adam as something difficult for her to grasp.\n\nReception\n\nLind received praise for her performance. In its \"Best and Worst of 2014\" issue, Soaps In Depth wrote that the actress is \"good enough to bring to mind Camryn Grimes' early days as Cassie\", while also commending the soap opera for \"sensibly playing the youngster as what she is – a kid.\" For her portrayal, Lind was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2017; at age nine, this made her one of the youngest soap opera actors to be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award. That year, On-Air On-Soaps stated that Lind \"can handle any material given to her\" and that \"her acting chops are well beyond her years.\" Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest praised the \"emotional nuances\" Lind brought to the character, stating that she \"delivered in spades\" as Faith grew up and became more involved in dramatic storylines. Charlie Mason of Soaps.com also praised Lind's portrayal of Faith's \"teenage angst\". In April 2020, as Faith reacted to her mother's cancer diagnosis, Soaps In Depth praised the performances of Lind and Case as \"powerful\" and \"heartwarming\", writing that they \"have always struck the perfect balance in their alter egos' mother-and-child relationship, but as they deal with these dark days, the actresses are shining ever brighter.\" At the 48th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2021, Lind was nominated for Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series. \n\nLind's exit from the series was met with disappointment from fans, given that she had grown up on-screen. Janet Di Lauro of the online magazine Soap Hub praised Caster for \"fitting into Lind's formidable shoes\", stating that she \"immediately grasped the character’s essence, connecting with her plight and problems. She’s never tried to do too much in her scenes, instead making her mark with understated performances that allowed viewers to feel her sorrow and embarrassment over Faith’s reckless acts.\" Di Lauro also spoke positively of Faith's friendship with Moses, finding their banter \"real and believable\". \n\nJim Halterman of TV Insider called it a \"typically juicy soap opera twist\" when Faith needs a kidney transplant and \"the one candidate to help save her life with a kidney donation is none other than Adam\". However, Canyon News criticized this twist and the writers' efforts to \"humanize\" Adam, writing: \"I mean how many times can Adam be touted as the rescuer for Sharon, Nick and Faith Newman notably?\", noting that Adam had already saved Faith twice before.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Young and the Restless characters", "machine_text": " Faith Newman (born Newman; previously Newman Mills; March 2, 1994) is a fictional character from The Bold and the Beautiful.

He received his M.S. in physics in 1970 from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and his Ph.D. in physics in 1975 from the Institute for High Energy Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences. He worked as a research scientist at the Institute for High Energy Physics from 1975 to 1991 and as a professor at the Moscow State University from 1981 to 1991. In 1990, he became a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Since 1998, he has been a professor at the University of Michigan. Kavalyow is known for his work on the theory of the strong interactions and the theory of quantum chromodynamics. He is one of the pioneers of the concept of non-perturbative dynamics of the strong interactions. In the early 1970s, together with Michael Shifman and David Olive, he discovered the mechanism of the formation of quark-antiquark pairs, which became the basis of the quarkonia theory. In the late 1970s, together with John H. Hubbell, III, he predicted the formation of heavy quarkonia (charmonia and bottomonia) and their distinctive structure, which was later confirmed by the experiments. In the early 1980s, together with Valentine P. Landsberg and Michael Aivazis, he proposed the concept of the \"effective field theory\" of the strong interactions, which was later used by many researchers. In the 1990s, together with Michael Aivazis and Vladimir Orlov, he developed the theory of \"colored\" corrections to the strong interactions. In the early 1970s, Kavalyow was one of the founders of the theory of weak interactions and the theory of quantum flavor dynamics. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was one of the pioneers of the theory of the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs boson. In the early 1990s, he proposed the concept of the \"little Higgs boson,\" which was later found by the experiments. Kavalyow is the author or co-author of more than 500 scientific papers, as well as the author of several books, including \"The Higgs Boson Story\" (2013), \"The Standard Model\" (2016), and \"The New Physics: From Higgs to Hawking\" (2018).

The Country Liberal Party government, and its federal counterpart, supported the Yes case. The opposition Labor Party supported the No case.\n\nThe referendum was narrowly defeated, 51.9% to 48.1%. The \"Yes\" case received 44,702 votes, the \"No\" case 48,241. There were 1068 invalid ballots.\n\nThe result was widely interpreted as a personal rebuke to then Chief Minister Shane Stone. Polls suggest that most of the people living in the Northern Territory continue to support statehood for the territory in principle.\n\nThe failed referendum has been seen as the trigger for the demise of the CLP government which had been in power since 1974.\n\nIn February 1999, months after the failed referendum, Stone resigned as Chief Minister before his colleagues had a chance to dump him with the failed referendum being the trigger for his ousting.\n\nHe was replaced by Denis Burke who then led the CLP to defeat in 2001 election marking the end of 27 years of CLP rule.\n\nBackground\n\nThe territory has a legislative assembly. Whilst this assembly exercises roughly the same powers as the governments of the states of Australia, it does so by delegation of powers from the commonwealth government, rather than by any constitutional right.  For several years there has been agitation for full statehood.\n\nUnder the Australian Constitution, the Federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three Senators, rather than the twelve guaranteed to original states.

Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then Chief Minister Shane Stone, it is believed that most Territorians were reluctant to adopt the offer which was made.\n\nA bipartisan NT Legislative Assembly Committee, chaired by former Chief Minister Stephen Hatton, had proposed a draft Constitution and that it should be debated at an elected Constitutional Convention. Shane Stone ignored the latter recommendation, nominating a Convention membership of 53 members at short notice, and then presented to the Convention a draft Constitution that was different from the Committee's recommendation. Stephen Hatton later said \"one of the campaign slogans at the time was, we want statehood, not Stonehood\".\n\nReferences\n\n1998 elections in Australia\n1998 referendums\nReferendums in the Northern Territory\n1990s in the Northern Territory\nOctober 1998 events in Australia", "machine_text": " The 1998 Northern Territory referendum was a referendum held in the Northern Territory on Saturday, 30 November 1998, to determine whether the Northern Territory should become a state of Australia. A majority of the voters voted in favour of the question \"Are you in favour of the Northern Territory becoming a State?\" and the referendum passed. The result was 56.9% in favour (31,928 votes) and 43.1% against (22,232 votes). The Northern Territory was previously administered as part of the Northern Territory (NT) Australia Act 1978, which also provided for the possibility of the Territory becoming a state. The Act was amended in 1994 to provide that if the Territory was to become a state, it would be known as the Northern Territory. The Constitution of Australia did not provide for the creation of new states, and the legal questions surrounding the process were not completely settled. The referendum was the third attempt to make the Northern Territory a state, following earlier referendums in 1967 and 1974, which failed with 52% and 54% of the vote, respectively. The 1998 referendum resulted in a change to the Australian Constitution to allow the Northern Territory to become a state, if they so choose. The referendum also provided for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to become a state, if a majority of its voters so choose. However, unlike the Northern Territory, the ACT did not achieve the required majority, with the vote being 52% in favour and 48% against. The referendum also had other changes to the Constitution, including to provide that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be counted in the census and to allow the Australian Parliament to legislate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the Northern Territory.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 9269318}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Kaira (spider)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Kaira, sometimes called frilled orbweavers, is a mostly neotropical genus of orb-weaver spiders first described by O. Pickard-Cambridge in 1889. It includes sixteen described species that occur from South America up to the southern and eastern USA. It is presumably related to Aculepeira, Amazonepeira and Metepeira.\n\nThey spin small webs from which they hang upside down and attract male moths that fly into a basket formed by their legs. They use a moth pheromone for this, which resembles the one used by the bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora. Though they belong to the same family, the two genera are not closely related, so this is likely an example of convergent evolution.\n\nAll species are pale yellow-white with scattered, small, white, brown and black random spots, or in some species transverse bands. Females have a body length of about . Males are less than half the size of females and less pigmented.\n\nKaira specimens are uncommon in arachnologist collections, and the females of different species are difficult to separate. Females and immatures can be confused with species of the not closely related genus Pozonia.\n\nBehavior\nWhen a fly was put into a jar containing a K. alba, the female dropped from the underside of the lid on what seemed a single thread about  long and hung there until the fly blundered into her. Then she clamped her legs around it and killed it. Instead of constructing orb webs, they construct a small trapezoidal web, containing two triangular zigzags of threads, which is remade every twenty minutes. The spider then hangs upside-down by the fourth leg on the lower and shorter parallel edge of the trapezoid, which is spread by the other legs. When a moth flies into the basket formed by the spider's legs, it is clasped and bitten, and later wrapped in araneid-like fashion. The moth is then hung from a trapeze line between the last legs of the spider, which resumes the hunting posture. As many as eight moths can be caught in this way before the spider starts feeding.\n\nSpecies\n it contains sixteen species:\nKaira alba (Hentz, 1850) – USA, Mexico\nKaira altiventer O.

The Kaira is an octa-rotor MAV designed for autonomous vertical take-off and landing and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 2 kg. Its lightweight landing system makes the Kaira suitable for deployment in remote sensing and military applications. The Kaira has a central metallic body with eight arms, each carrying a rotor. The body and the arms are made of aluminum and magnesium alloys and are covered with a carbon fiber skin. The Kaira is powered by eight electric motors and eight Li-ion battery packs. The total weight of the Kaira is 4.5 kg, excluding the payload. In its normal mode of operation, the Kaira can fly at a height of 1 km and a maximum distance of 4 km. Its landing system can automatically land the Kaira on a pre-defined landing pad. The Kaira can also be remotely controlled to fly in a waypoint navigation mode. The Kaira was developed by a team of faculty and students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, with support from the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, Government of India, and the Indian Space Research Organization.

In the 1920s, he began to work on graphic design,\napplying the principles of De Stijl and constructivism to commercial advertising. Along with Gerard Kiljan and his famous colleague Piet Zwart, he followed ideas pioneered in the Soviet Union by El Lissitzky and Rodchenko, in Poland by Henryk Berlewi and in Germany by Kurt Schwitters.\n\nDuring his employment at  the NV Maatschappij Van Berkel Patent scale company in Rotterdam, Schuitema gained recognition for his original designs of stationery and publicity material, often using only the colors black, red and white and bold sans serif fonts. From 1926 on, he started working with photomontages, becoming one of the pioneers of this technique in the field of industrial design. Schuitema was a member of Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Ambachts- en Nijverheidskunst (V.A.N.K.) the Dutch Association for Craft and Craft Art.\n\nEven though he was a convinced socialist and often designed leftist publications directed at industrial workers, Schuitema also worked for major companies, such as Philips.\n\nPost-war filmmaker\nDuring the final years of World War II, Schuitema, along with Jan Bouman, Lou Lichtveld and Eduard Verschueren, began planning for the post-war art community in the Netherlands. In 1944, the four publish a \"Report on Stimulation, Development and Organization of the Film Industry in the Netherlands\" (Rapport inzake de stimuleering, ontwikkeling en ordening van het Filmwezen in Nederland).\n\nFollowing Dolle Dinsdag (5 September 1944), he officially joined the resistance forces, assuming a leadership role in the National Film and Photo Reportage Service. After the end of the war, Schuitema and his three partners founded the Dutch Cooperative for Film Production (Nederlandse Werkgemeenschap voor Filmproductie,  NWF) in Haarlem and gave the impulse for the formation of the Dutch Film Makers Guild (Beroepsvereniging van Nederlandse Cineasten).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Villanovan culture\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Villanovan culture (c. 900–700 BC), regarded as the earliest phase of the Etruscan civilization, was the earliest Iron Age culture of Italy. It directly followed the Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture which branched off from the Urnfield culture of Central Europe. The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality of Castenaso in the Metropolitan City of Bologna where, between 1853 and 1855, Giovanni Gozzadini found the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which 179 to cremation and 14 to inhumation.\n\nThe Villanovans introduced iron-working to the Italian Peninsula. They practiced cremation and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.\n\nHistory\n\nThe name Villanovan of the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found near Villanova (Castenaso, 12 kilometres south-east of Bologna) in northern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, count Giovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The \"well tomb\" pit graves lined with stones contained funerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis at Verucchio overlooking the Adriatic coastal plain.\n\nThe burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300–750 BC) and Celtic Hallstatt culture that succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed in cinerary urns, specifically in biconical urns and then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known as impasto. A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typical sgraffito decorations of swastikas, meanders, and squares were scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronze fibulae, razors and rings.\n\nPeriodization\nThe Villanovan culture is broadly divided into Villanovan I from c. 960 BC to c. 801 BC and the Villanovan II from c. 800 BC to 720 BC. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along the Amber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass and amber necklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings of bronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture. Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earlier cremation practices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particular Southern Etruria, entered the Orientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development as Villanovan III (750–680 BC)  and Villanovan IV (680–540 BC).\n\nVillanovan chronology within the Etruscan civilization\n\nMetalwork and trade \nThe metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.\n\nDuring the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.\n\nHousing \nBuildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy. Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.\n\nVillanovan settlements \nGenerally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the Adriatic Etruria, in Emilia Romagna (in particular, in Bologna and in Verucchio, near Rimini), in Marche (Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, in Tuscany and Lazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found in Campania, at Capua, at the \"princely tombs\" of Pontecagnano near Salerno, at Capo di Fiume, at Vallo di Diano and at Sala Consilina.\n\nSmall scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements—largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally follows Massimo Pallottino in regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to the Etruscan civilization.\n\nGenetics\nA genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried in Veio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BC and 800 BC. She carried the maternal haplogroup K1a4. and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9% Copper Age ancestry (EEF + WHG) and 27.1% Steppe-related ancestry. There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara near Civitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former.\n\nSee also\nEtruscans\nProto-Villanovan culture\nPrehistoric Italy\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources and further reading\n\n \nGiovanni Gozzadini, La nécropole de Villanova, Fava et Garagnani, Bologna, 1870\nJ.

It takes its name from the site of Villanovan, an ancient village in the Italian province of Emilia-Romagna, near Bologna, where in 1881–82, a number of cemetery sites were discovered, with artifacts characteristic of the culture. The Villanovan culture was a significant influence on the later Etruscan civilization. The Villanovan culture emerged from the earlier Final Bronze Age (1300–1100 BC), as a result of the invasion of the peninsula by the Sea Peoples and the subsequent collapse of several Mycenaean-like centres in southern Italy. The Villanovan culture was part of the Tyrrhenian cultural horizon, which also included the contemporary cultures of the Etruscans, the Celtic Hallstatt culture, and the Greek colonial world of Magna Graecia. The Villanovan culture is distinguished from the preceding and contemporary Italian cultures by a number of characteristics, such as: - Use of cremation - dominance of tombs - good quality pottery - the presence of weapons - the absence of imported luxury goods The characteristic handmade pottery of the Villanovan culture was made from local clays, and often featured a red slip. The remains of the Villanovan culture have been found in many parts of Italy, especially in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League), in the Po Valley, in Campania, in Basilicata, and in Sicily. In the 9th century BC, the Villanovan culture was succeeded by the Etruscan civilization, which developed in the area of Etruria (Etruscan League) and in the Po Valley. In the 6th century BC, the Etruscan civilization was in turn succeeded by the Roman Republic. The Villanovan culture is the basis for the modern Western alphabet, which is based on the Etruscan letters, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western alphabet. The Villanovan culture is also the basis for the modern Western calendar, as the Etruscan civilization developed the first Western calendar.

He toured the United States in 1908 and 1909 and competed in England and Scotland in 1911 and 1913. At his peak he was considered by many to be the finest all-round athlete in the world.\n\nIn August or September 1909 he challenged World Heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson to a sprint, for a cash prize of $1,000. Despite Johnson's willingness the challenge never came off.\n\nIn 1912, he competed for the all-round professional championship against American John A. MacDonald, with Knox winning seven of the 10 events and the world title. He won the all-round world title again in 1914, defeating F.R. Cramb of Scotland in Manchester by winning six of eight events. Knox coached the Canadian track and field team at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm and later became a travelling coach for the Ontario Athletic Commission and a coach at Queen's University. He was also hired to coach the British team at the 1916 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but this never came to fruition due to the First World War.

Knox was born in Shanghai, Republic of China, in 1927. He received his BS in chemistry from the University of Washington in 1949, and his MD from the University of Washington School of Medicine in 1953. He joined the U.S. Public Health Service as a medical officer in 1954, and served as a ship's physician on the USS Benewah during the Vietnam War from 1965 to 1966. In 1970, he joined the National Cancer Institute as a research associate. He became a senior investigator in 1980, and headed the Laboratory of Interferon Research at the National Cancer Institute until his retirement in 2005. Knox was a pioneer in the field of interferon research. Interferons are a group of proteins that are secreted by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. They are known to have important roles in the immune system, and have been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain cancers. Knox's work focused on the identification and characterization of interferons and their receptors, and the mechanisms by which they are produced and regulated. In 1979, Knox discovered the virus that causes Kaposi's Sarcoma, a rare cancer that occurs in AIDS patients. He was the first to show that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma, and his work led to the development of the first diagnostic test for the virus. Knox was a member of the editorial boards of several scientific journals, including the Journal of Interferon Research, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American College of Physicians, and a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the National Academy of Sciences.

It seeks to understand how drugs affect the human body as a single complex biological system. \nInstead of considering the effect of a drug to be the result of one specific drug-protein interaction, systems pharmacology considers the effect of a drug to be the outcome of the network of interactions a drug may have. In 1992, an article on systems medicine and pharmacology was published in China. Networks of interaction may include chemical-protein, protein–protein, genetic, signalling and physiological (at cellular, tissue, organ and whole body levels).

It is a new approach to the old field of molecular pharmacology, which was largely focused on the actions of drugs at the molecular level (e.g., receptor binding). Systems pharmacology integrates molecular information (e.g., protein binding) with information at other levels of biological organization (e.g., cells, tissues, organisms), using both experimental and computational methods. A major component of systems pharmacology is the construction of computational models that can be used to make predictions about new drugs and new therapeutic targets. The models use fundamental principles of physics and chemistry to describe the behavior of molecules, cells, and organisms. These models can be used to make predictions about new drugs and new therapeutic targets. For example, a systems pharmacology model could be used to predict the effects of a new drug on a particular target. The model would use principles of physics and chemistry to describe the behavior of the target, and the effects of the drug on the target. The model could then be used to make predictions about the effects of the drug on the target, and the potential therapeutic applications of the drug. In addition to making predictions, systems pharmacology models can also be used to understand the mechanisms of drug action. For example, a systems pharmacology model could be used to understand how a drug works at the molecular level, or how it works at the level of cells or organisms. The model would use principles of physics and chemistry to describe the behavior of the drug, and how it interacts with the target. Systems pharmacology is a powerful tool for drug discovery and therapeutic target validation. It combines the power of systems biology and computational methods to model how drugs work, and to make predictions about new drugs and new therapeutic targets. Systems pharmacology models can also be used to understand the mechanisms of drug action, and to optimize the design of new drugs.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 38736538}

This intervention was a major factor in the demise of the Balinese kingdom of Klungkung. In the early 19th century, the Netherlands started a war against the archipelago's major power, the Sultan of Mataram. This war, which is known as the Java War, lasted for four years. Although the Dutch won this war, the Sultan of Mataram retained much of his power. After the Java War, the Dutch started to increase their influence over the islands of Bali and Lombok. In 1846, the king of Klungkung, Ida Dalam, asked the Dutch for help. He had been dethroned by his brother, Ida Anak Agung Gede, who had aligned himself with the Sultan of Lombok. The Dutch, however, did not want to get involved in another conflict with the Sultan of Lombok. Instead, they advised the king of Klungkung to seek the help of the king of Karangasem, who was then aligned with the Dutch. In 1847, the king of Karangasem, who was then called Prince Mangku, sent his troops to Klungkung to help the king. The troops were led by an officer called Raden Donadt. Although they were able to remove the king's brother from the palace, the king's brother later returned to the palace with the troops of the Sultan of Lombok. In 1848, the Dutch decided to intervene directly in the conflict. They sent a ship to northern Bali to bombard the palace of Klungkung. The ship was called the Gedeh. The Dutch believed that the king's brother was not a legitimate king, so they decided to try to reinstall the king. The bombardment of the palace caused a lot of damage, but it did not have the effect that the Dutch had hoped. Instead, it caused the people of Klungkung to become even more determined to resist the Dutch. In the end, the Dutch were not able to reinstall the king. However, they were able to take control of the southern part of Klungkung. The king's brother was allowed to remain in the northern part of Klungkung.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 25512637}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Hydraulic fluid\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A hydraulic fluid or hydraulic liquid is the medium by which power is transferred in hydraulic machinery. Common hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil or water. Examples of equipment that might use hydraulic fluids are excavators and backhoes, hydraulic brakes, power steering systems,  automatic transmissions, garbage trucks, aircraft flight control systems, lifts, and industrial machinery.\n\nHydraulic systems like the ones mentioned above will work most efficiently if the hydraulic fluid used has zero compressibility.\n\nFunctions and properties \n\nThe primary function of a hydraulic fluid is to convey power. In use, however, there are other important functions of hydraulic fluid such as protection of the hydraulic machine components. The table below lists the major functions of a hydraulic fluid and the properties of a fluid that affect its ability to perform that function:\n\nComposition\n\nBase stock\nThe original hydraulics fluid, dating back to the time of ancient Egypt, was water. Beginning in the 1920s, mineral oil began to be used more than water as a base stock due to its inherent lubrication properties and ability to be used at temperatures above the boiling point of water. Today most hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil base stocks.\n\nNatural oils such as rapeseed (also called canola oil) are used as base stocks for fluids where biodegradability and renewable sources are considered important.\n\nOther base stocks are used for specialty applications, such as for fire resistance and extreme temperature applications. Some examples include: glycol ethers, organophosphate ester, polyalphaolefin, propylene glycol, and silicone oils.\n\nNaK-77, a eutectic alloy of sodium and potassium, can be used as a hydraulic fluid in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, for temperature ranges of 10 to 1400 °F (-12 to 760 °C). Its bulk modulus at 1000 °F (538 °C) is 310,000 psi (2.14 GPa), higher than of a hydraulic oil at room temperature. Its lubricity is poor, so positive-displacement pumps are unsuitable and centrifugal pumps have to be used. Addition of caesium shifts the useful temperature range to -95 to 1300 °F (−70 to 704 °C). The NaK-77 alloy was tested in hydraulic and fluidic systems for the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile.\n\nOther components\nHydraulic fluids can contain a wide range of chemical compounds, including: oils, butanol, esters (e.g. phthalates, like DEHP, and adipates, like bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), organophosphate (e.g. tributylphosphate), silicones, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, polyalphaolefins (PAO) (e.g. polyisobutenes), corrosion inhibitors (incl acid scavengers), anti-erosion additives, etc.\n\nBiodegradable hydraulic fluids\nEnvironmentally sensitive applications (e.g. farm tractors and marine dredging) may benefit from using biodegradable hydraulic fluids based upon rapeseed (Canola) vegetable oil when there is the risk of an oil spill from a ruptured oil line. Typically these oils are available as ISO 32, ISO 46, and ISO 68 specification oils. ASTM standards ASTM-D-6006, Guide for Assessing Biodegradability of Hydraulic Fluids and ASTM-D-6046, Standard Classification of Hydraulic Fluids for Environmental Impact are relevant.\n\nAnti-wear hydraulic fluids\nAnti-wear (AW) hydraulic oils are made from a petroleum base fluid and commonly contain the anti-wear additive Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). This additive works to protect the hydraulic pump. They come in multiple viscosity grades that have varying applications. For example, AW 46 hydraulic oils can be used to operate the hydraulic systems in off-road equipment such as dump trucks, excavators, and backhoes, while AW 32 hydraulic oils may be more suitable for colder weather applications like in a snow plow's pump.\n\nSafety \nBecause industrial hydraulic systems operate at hundreds to thousands of PSI and temperatures reaching hundreds of degrees Celsius, severe injuries and death can result from component failures and care must always be taken when performing maintenance on hydraulic systems.\n\nFire resistance is a property available with specialized fluids. Water-glycol and polyol-ester are some of these specialized fluids that contain excellent thermal and hydrolitic properties, which aid in fire resistance.\n\nUses\n\nBrake fluid \nBrake fluid is a subtype of hydraulic fluid with high boiling point, both when new (specified by the equilibrium boiling point) and after absorption of water vapor (specified by wet boiling point). Under the heat of braking, both free water and water vapor in a braking system can boil into a compressible vapor, resulting in brake failure. Glycol-ether based fluids are hygroscopic, and absorbed moisture will greatly reduce the boiling point over time. Mineral oil and silicone based fluids are not hygroscopic.\n\nPower steering fluid\nPower steering fluid is a sub type of hydraulic fluid. Most are mineral oil or silicone based fluids, while some use automatic transmission fluid, made from synthetic base oil.  Automatic transmissions use fluids for their lubrication, cooling and hydraulic properties for viscous couplings.\n\nUse of the wrong type of fluid can lead to failure of the power steering pump.\n\nAircraft hydraulic systems \nAs aircraft performance increased in the mid-20th century, the amount of force required to operate mechanical flight controls became excessive, and hydraulic systems were introduced to reduce pilot effort. The hydraulic actuators are controlled by valves; these in turn are operated directly by input from the aircrew (hydro-mechanical) or by computers obeying control laws (fly by wire).\n\nHydraulic power is used for other purposes. It can be stored in accumulators to start an auxiliary power unit (APU) for self-starting the aircraft's main engines. Many aircraft equipped with the M61 family of cannon use hydraulic power to drive the gun system, permitting reliable high rates of fire.\n \nThe hydraulic power itself comes from pumps driven by the engines directly, or by electrically-driven pumps. In modern commercial aircraft these are electrically-driven pumps; should all the engines fail in flight the pilot will deploy a propeller-driven electric generator called a Ram-Air Turbine (RAT) which is concealed under the fuselage. This provides electrical power for the hydraulic pumps and control systems as power is no longer available from the engines. In that system and others, electric pumps can provide both redundancy and the means of operating hydraulic systems without the engines operating, which can be very useful during maintenance.\n\nSpecifications\nMineral oil base:\n Mil-PRF-5606 (originally Mil-H-5606): Mineral base, flammable, fairly low flashpoint, usable from   to , red color, developed in the 1940s\n MIL-PRF-6083: Usable from −54 °C to 135 °C \"where corrosion protection is required and a determination has been made that MIL-PRF-46170 (FRH) hydraulic fluid cannot be used.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Palestinian literature\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Palestinian literature refers to the Arabic language novels, short stories and poems produced by Palestinians. Forming part of the broader genre of Arabic literature, contemporary Palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity. References to the subjects of resistance to occupation, exile, loss, and love and longing for homeland are also common.\n\nHistorical Origins\nPalestinian literature is one of numerous Arabic literatures, but its affiliation is national, rather than territorial. While Egyptian literature is that written in Egypt, Jordanian literature is that written in Jordan etc., and up until the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Palestinian literature was also territory-bound, since the 1948 Palestinian exodus it has become \"a literature written by Palestinians\" irrespective of their place of residence.\n\nOverview\n\nPalestinian Literature spoke to other causes of oppression and discrimination across the world. In his book, one of the foremost leaders of Palestinian literature and the person who coined the term Palestinian Resistance Literature, Ghassan Kanafani says, \"In my stories I give my characters the freedom to express their own positions without reservation\". This sense of international solidarity can also be found in Palestinian poets' work such as in Mahmoud Darwish's poem Cuban Chants, \"And the banner in Cuba.. The rebel raises it in the Aures.. Oh a nation that feels cold\", and in Samih Al-Qasim's poem, Birds Without Wings.\n\nIn the period between the 1948 Palestinian exodus and the 1967 Six-Day War, Palestinian Resistance Literature played a significant role in maintaining the Palestinian identity; forming a bridge between the two periods, which allowed the Palestinian identity to survive especially in the absence of armed resistance. In his book, Palestinian Resistance Literature Under Occupation, Ghassan Kanafani argues, \"Palestinian resistance literature, just like armed resistance, shapes a new circle in the historical series which practically has not been cut throughout the last half century in the Palestinian life”. \n \nSince 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three \"branches\" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the occupied territories, 3) from among the Palestinian diaspora throughout the Middle East.\n\nHannah Amit-Kochavi recognizes only two branches: that written by Palestinians from inside the State of Israel as distinct from that written outside. She also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter. In a 2003 article published in the Studies in the Humanities journal, Steven Salaita posits a fourth branch made up of English language works, particularly those written by Palestinians in the United States, which he defines as \"writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on Palestine.\" However, Maurice Ebileeni argues that a fourth branch referring exclusively to anglophone literary works is not sufficient. Rather, Palestinian displacement both in Israel/Palestine and the diaspora have led to cultural and lingual diversification among Palestinians that exceeds experiences in Arabic- and English-speaking locations. Ebileeni suggest a polylingual branch that entails works by Palestinian authors - or authors of Palestinian descent - written in English as well as Italian, Spanish, Danish, Hebrew and several other languages.\n\nPalestinian literature can be intensely political, as underlined by writers like Salma Khadra Jayyusi and novelist Liana Badr, who have mentioned the need to give expression to the Palestinian \"collective identity\" and the \"just case\" of their struggle. There is also resistance to this school of thought, whereby Palestinian artists have \"rebelled\" against the demand that their art be \"committed\". Poet Mourid Barghouti for example, has often said that \"poetry is not a civil servant, it's not a soldier, it's in nobody's employ.\" Rula Jebreal's novel Miral tells the story of Hind Husseini's effort to establish an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Deir Yassin Massacre, and the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nNovels and short stories\nSusan Abulhawas book Mornings in Jenin tells the story of a Palestinian family lost their homes during the 1948 war. In A Rift in Time author  Raja Shehadeh explored the relationship between the decline of the Ottoman Empire, British colonialism and Palestinian self-identity in a novel about his great-uncle Najib Nassar.\nShort stories in Palestinian literature started with writers like Samira Azam.\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry, using classic pre-Islamic forms, remains an extremely popular art form, often attracting Palestinian audiences in the thousands. Until 20 years ago, local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every Palestinian town.\n\nAfter the 1948 Palestinian exodus, poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism. From among those Palestinians who became Arab citizens of Israel and after the passage of the Citizenship Law of 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Tawfiq Zayyad.\n\nThe work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. The situation changed after Ghassan Kanafani, another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon published an anthology of their work in 1966.\n\nThe work of Nathalie Handal  an award-winning poet, playwright, and writer appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines. She has been translated into twelve languages. She has promoted international literature through translation, research, and the edited The Poetry of Arab Women, an anthology that introduced several Arab women poets to a wider audience in the west.\n\nPalestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland. In a poem about the Israeli bombing of Lebanon, published in the Palestinian literary magazine al-Karmel, Mahmoud Darwish wrote:\nSmoke rises from me, I reach out a hand to collect my limbs scattered from so many bodies, besieged from land and sky and sea and language. The last plane has taken off from Beirut airport and left me in front of the screen to watch\nwith millions of viewers\nthe rest of my death \nAs for my heart, I see it roll, like a pine cone, from Mount Lebanon, to Gaza.\n\nHakawati\nThe art of story telling was for a long time part of the cultural life in Arabic speaking countries of the Middle East. The tradition of “Tales From a Thousand and One Nights” is not an exception. In each small town or village of Palestine, itinerant story tellers called hakawati would visit and tell folk stories they knew, often in teahouses. The tales of the hakawati, once told for all ages, are now sometimes emerging from the Palestinian diaspora as children's books.\n\nSee also\n Palestine Festival of Literature\n Palestinian art\n Palestinian handicrafts\n Palestinian music\n Palestinian National Theatre\n Speak, Bird, Speak Again\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional references\n Alvarado-Larroucau, Carlos, Écritures palestiniennes francophones ; Quête d’identité en espace néocolonial, Paris, Éditions L’Harmattan, coll. « Critiques littéraires », 2009.\n\nExternal links\nReview of the anthology Qissat: Short Stories by Palestinian Women\nGoogle Books Sonia Nimr, Hannah Shaw, Ghada Karmi (2008) “Ghaddar the Ghoul and Other Palestinian Stories”, frances lincoln ltd, \nPalestinian Literature: News and Reviews at IMEU.net\nMornings in Jenin by Susan Abulhawa review\n\n \nLiterature by ethnicity", "machine_text": " Palestinian literature is the literature of the Palestinian people, whether in the Arabic or Hebrew languages.

In this sense, Palestinian literature is a sub-set of Arabic literature. In a more restricted sense, Palestinian literature is in the exclusive domain of the Palestinian Arabic language, and a specific aspect of this literature may be defined as Palestinian Hebrew literature. The concept of Palestinian literature has been evolving since the late 19th century, and the term was not coined until the 20th century. The term Palestinian literature does not include the Jewish Palestinian literature, which is an integral part of Hebrew literature. The traditional literature of Palestine has its roots in the literature of the three monotheistic religions: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. The traditional literature in the Arabic language is closely related to the wider Arab world, while the traditional Hebrew literature is related to the Jewish people and the wider Hebrew literature. The traditional Palestinian literature in these two languages has been influenced by the powerful religious traditions of the three monotheistic religions, as well as by the political and social circumstances of the Palestinian people. The modern Palestinian literature in the Arabic language began to be developed in the 19th century, and was influenced by the changes in the political and social circumstances of the Arab world. The modern Palestinian literature in Hebrew was mainly developed in the 20th century, and was influenced by the changes in the political and social circumstances of the Jewish people and the Hebrew literature. The modern Palestinian literature in these two languages has been developed within the context of the national movement of the Palestinian people, and has been strongly influenced by the political and social circumstances of this movement.

It spent one week on the UK Albums Chart at number 48, a marked contrast to the top 10 debut of their preceding album, The Infotainment Scan. The album's full title is Middle Class Revolt A/K/A The Vapourisation Of Reality. Drummer Karl Burns features for the first time since 1985's This Nation's Saving Grace, having rejoined the band in 1993.\n\nContent\nThe album included two songs previously released as singles, \"Behind the Counter\" (December 1993 – UK no. 75) and \"15 Ways\" (April 1994 – UK no. 65), although different versions of both were included on the album. A further five tracks from the album featured as B-sides across the formats of these singles, and, although most were different versions, this meant that the album only contained seven songs that were new to fans upon its release, three of which were cover versions. In addition, \"Hey! Student\" is a reworked version of \"Hey! Fascist\", which The Fall used to play live in their early days (as shown by its inclusion on Live 1977). The version of \"M5\" included was considered inferior to the version released on the Behind the Counter EP in 1993.\n\nThe album's cover versions were less mainstream than some of their other recent choices: \"War\", originally by Henry Cow and Slapp Happy, \"Shut Up!\", originally by The Monks (whom The Fall had already covered twice on 1990s Extricate) and a bizarre version of \"Junk Man\", originally by The Groundhogs. According to Daryl Easlea's sleeve notes for the 2006 reissue, Mark E. Smith prevailed upon the group to deliver the song from memory and, as a result, was backed by minimal drums, bass, kazoo and some tuneless hollering from Burns. \"Symbol of Mordgan\" is based upon a recording of Scanlon discussing a football match by telephone on John Peel's Saturday afternoon programme.\n\nMiddle Class Revolt is, as Easlea notes, not a uniformly popular album amongst the group's fans. Nevertheless, it houses some popular tracks. Indeed, \"Hey!

Jim Sullivan, for The Boston Globe, stated the album has \"enough caustic barbs and wry witticisms snake through the dense mix to provide cerebral fun for those who like to carp along\", going on to say \"It's nasty, it's gleeful, it's the Fall still twisting the ironic/angry knife.\" Mark Jenkins, in The Washington Post'', described it as \"unusually smooth for an album by these veteran British post-punk eccentrics\" viewing its highlights to be \"its irascible mantras, notably the unusually quick-tempoed \"Hey! Student\" and the dense \"Shut Up!\"\". Stereogum's Robert Ham viewed it as their \"best album in at least five years\".\n\nTrack listing\nThe album was controversial for its writing credits, in which all Fall originals were credited to Mark E. Smith, Craig Scanlon and Steve Hanley, despite some of the tracks having already been credited differently on the preceding single releases. According to drummer Simon Wolstencroft (who claimed to have co-written \"Middle Class Revolt\" and \"City Dweller\"), there was \"a misprint on the credits due to a cock-up at the record label\".\n\nSome CD editions erroneously list \"War\" as track 13, although the actual running order on CD is correct.\n\n2006 edition\nThe album was remastered and reissued by Castle Music as an expanded two-disc set in 2006.

In the early 1970s, the middle class in the United States began to feel squeezed by the rising cost of living and by taxes. At the same time, the middle class was also upset about the decline in the quality of education and the increase in crime. In response to these concerns, a movement of middle-class Americans began to organize politically. The movement, which became known as the Middle Class Revolt, began to press for lower taxes, higher quality education, and lower crime. In the 1980s, the Middle Class Revolt began to gain traction. In 1980, the Republican Party nominated Ronald Reagan for president. Reagan, who was a strong supporter of the Middle Class Revolt, won the election. Reagan's victory helped to popularize the Middle Class Revolt. In the 1990s, the Middle Class Revolt began to falter. In the early 1990s, the economy began to improve, and the middle class began to feel less squeezed. At the same time, the quality of education began to improve, and crime began to decline. As a result, the Middle Class Revolt began to lose momentum. Today, the Middle Class Revolt is still alive, but it is no longer a major force in American politics. However, the ideas and concerns that drove the Middle Class Revolt are still important to many Americans.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4771378}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Lena massacre\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Lena Massacre or Lena Execution (, Lenskiy rasstrel) refers to the shooting of goldfield workers on strike in northeast Siberia near the Lena River on .\n\nThe strike had been provoked by exceptionally harsh working conditions, and when the strike committee was arrested, a large crowd marched in protest. They were fired on by soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army, causing hundreds of casualties. The incident did much to stimulate revolutionary feeling in Russia, and Alexander Kerensky's reporting of it in the Duma brought him to public notice for the first time.\n\nThe owners of the company\nAt the time of the strike 66% of the shares of the Lena Gold Mining Partnership (Lenzoloto) were owned by Lena Goldfields, a company registered in London and traded in London, Paris and St. Petersburg. 70% of Lena Goldfields, or about 46% of Lenzoloto, was in the hands of Russian businessmen and managed by a committee of the Russian investors of the company. 30% of Lena Goldfields, or about 20% of Lenzoloto, was in the hands of British businessmen. The remaining 30% of Lenzoloto was owned by the Gintsburg family (also spelled Günzburg and other variants) and their companions.\n\nBackground\n\nThe incident took place at the goldfields of the Lena Gold Mining Joint Stock Company (Lenzoloto), located along the shores of the Lena River about 28 miles northeast of the town of Bodaybo in northern Irkutsk. The venture produced large profits for its British and Russian shareholders, who included Aleksei Putilov (a director), Count Sergei Witte, and Empress Maria Fyodorovna. Working conditions were exceptionally harsh with miners having to work fifteen to sixteen hours a day. For every thousand workers, there were more than 700 accidents. Part of the meagre salary was often used to pay fines. The other part of it was given in the form of coupons to be used in stores at the mine itself. All this led a spontaneous strike at the Andreyevsky goldfield on March 13. An immediate cause for the strike was distribution of rotten meat at one of these stores.\n\nOn March 17, the workers established their demands: an 8-hour workday, a 30% raise in wages, the elimination of fines, and the improvement of food delivery. None of these demands were agreed to by the administration. With the Central Strike Committee and Central Bureau (P.N. Batashev, G.V. Cherepakhin, R.I. Zelionko, M.I. Lebedev, and others) in charge of the strike, it had extended to all the goldfields, and included over 6,000 workers, by mid-March.\n\nThe massacre\n\nThe tsarist government sent troops from Kirensk to Bodaybo, and on the night of April 17, all members of the strike committee were arrested. The next morning, the workers demanded their immediate release. That afternoon, some 2,500 people marched towards the Nadezhdinsky goldfield to deliver a complaint about the arbitrariness of the authorities to the prosecutor's office. The workers were met by soldiers, who began shooting at the crowd by the order of Captain Treshchenkov,  resulting in hundreds of dead and wounded. The local newspaper Zvezda, among others, reported 270 dead and 250 wounded.\n\nReactions\n\nThe massacre triggered a wave of strikes and protests. Soon afterwards, the administration offered its workers a new contract, which failed to meet their satisfaction. News of the massacre provoked nationwide strikes and protest meetings totalling more than 300,000 participants, with 700 political strikes during the month of April, and 1,000 strikes on 1 May in the St. Petersburg area alone. The strike continued until August 25, when the last of the workers withdrew from the mines and moved elsewhere. Altogether, an estimated 9,000 employees and family members abandoned the goldfields. The number of strikes in Russia had sharply declined from 14,000 in 1905 to just 222 in 1910. Next year it increased to 466 and 1,918 in 1912. Lenin argued that the massacre had 'inflamed the masses with a revolutionary fire'.\n\nThe massacre was protested by the leaders of the Social Democratic leaders and the Socialists Revolutionary leaders who were in Paris at the time of the event. Socialist parties, like the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, used this tragedy and the public outrage it sparked to further promote their political leanings throughout the Empire.\n\nThe massacre also triggered massive walkouts as a form of generalised opposition to the Tsarist political system through the yearly commemoration of the victims of excessive force during the Lena massacre. This commemorative event held deep significance to the public and attracted broad sympathy. The massacre contributed to general upset throughout society, shattering the calm restored in the Empire after the 1905 Revolution. The massacre greatly increased tension and unrest in factories and workshops, where the demand for better pay and conditions were yet to be reached throughout the Empire.\n\nThe Duma also passed a law which introduced insurance benefits, in times of sickness and accident as well as creating worker representatives, two months after the Lena massacre. This law improved the conditions of workers across the Empire.\n\nCommission of investigation\nThe public demanded the government send a commission to the goldfields to investigate the incident. Interior Minister Makarov dismissed the massacre, \"So it was. So it will be.\" The Duma commission on the Lena massacre was headed by Alexander Kerensky. His colourful reports of the incident greatly promoted widespread knowledge of the event, and also advanced his career from a backbencher to a popular leader of the Duma, as well as head of the Provisional Government of 1917. Joseph Stalin declared: \"The Lena shots broke the ice of silence, and the river of popular resentment is flowing again. The ice has broken. It has started!\"\n\nLenin\nIt has been suggested that Vladimir Ilyich Lenin adopted his more popular alias after the river Lena—Lenin—after this event, although he had in fact started using it years earlier, in 1901.\n\nSee also \nList of massacres in Russia\nPatom Highlands\n\nReferences \n\n1912 in the Russian Empire\n1912 labor disputes and strikes\nConflicts in 1912\nMass murder in 1912\nApril 1912 events\nMassacres in the 1910s\nMiners' labor disputes\nPolitics of the Russian Empire\nSociety of the Russian Empire\nMassacres in Russia\nIrkutsk Oblast", "machine_text": " Lena massacre The Lena massacre (Russian: Маскировка Лены) was the mass execution of prisoners by the Soviet Army in the vicinity of the Lena River, during the Soviet–Japanese War on August 13, 1944. The exact number of victims is uncertain; the Russian government has confirmed the death of 936 prisoners. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the number of victims was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. The execution was supervised by Captain Vladimir N. Yezhov, a member of the NKVD. Yezhov was later tried and executed for his role in the massacre. The Lena massacre is the largest known mass execution of Soviet civilians by the Soviet authorities during World War II. In the spring and summer of 1944, the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a major offensive against the Japanese forces in the Soviet Far East. The Soviet offensive, codenamed \"Purge\", was aimed at the liberation of the Pacific ports of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The Soviet troops were to cross the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea to reach the Japanese-occupied territory. The offensive was to be supported by the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet, which was to attack the Japanese from the Sea of Okhotsk. The Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet had suffered heavy losses during the Soviet–German War, and many of its ships had been sunk by the German Navy and the Japanese Navy. In preparation for the offensive, the Soviet authorities began to round up all the prisoners who had been previously convicted of \"anti-Soviet\" crimes. The prisoners were to be executed by the Soviet Army in order to \"purge\" the army of \"unreliable elements\". On August 13, 1944, the Soviet Army executed the prisoners in the area of the village of Rzhavets, in the vicinity of the Lena River, approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the city of Yakutsk. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the prisoners were brought to the site of the execution in two convoys. The convoys were composed of prisoner trucks and covered with tarpaulins. The trucks were driven by the prison's own personnel. Upon arrival at the execution site, the prisoners were forced to dismount and line up in four rows. The prisoners were ordered to undress and hand over their clothes and personal belongings. After that, the prisoners were shot in the back of the head and their bodies were thrown into the Lena River. In the spring of 1945, the Soviet authorities discovered the burial site of the executed prisoners. The burial site was located on a small island in the Lena River, several kilometers from the place of the execution. The island was named after the executed prisoners, and a memorial was erected on the island in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the Russian government launched an investigation into the Lena massacre. In 1994, the Russian authorities confirmed the death of 936 prisoners. According to the participants' confession at the trial, the number of victims was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. In 2004, the Russian government opened a criminal case on the basis of the previous investigation. In 2012, the Russian court found the executors of the Lena massacre guilty of \"the crime of genocide\". In March 2014, the Russian Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict of the Russian court and sent the case back for a new trial. The Russian court opened the new trial in May 2014. The Russian court found the executors of the Lena massacre guilty of \"the crime of genocide\" in July 2014. In February 2015, the Russian Supreme Court sent the case back for a new trial.

Gond completed her high schooling from Manohar Kanya High School, Janwar and is an Adivasi. When Ulrike Reinhard came up with the idea and created the skatepark in the village in 2015, Gond was one of many children who began to learn and practice skateboarding. The students had no formal training and learned from YouTube videos. Due to the rules laid down by Reinhard, the children were not distracted from their studies, gave girls the first priority with the few skateboards available, and did not discriminate on the basis of caste. Gond still faced insults and threats from her fellow villagers, who believed that she should continue with the regressive traditions imposed on the women of the village.\n\nIn 2016, Reinhard helped crowdfund Gond's education in the English language at The Butler Centre for Education in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, about  from Oxford.

The state included the area of the present-day Kendujhar district and most of what is now known as Mayurbhoomi (the northern portion of the present-day Khurda district). The state was bounded to the north by the British Raj-era Keonjhar State, to the south by the princely state of Mayurbhoomi, to the east by the British Raj-era Cuttack District, and to the west by the Western Ghats. The capital of the state was the town of Hindol, which is today a subdivision of the Kendujhar District. The state was ruled by the Tiperah family for three generations. The last ruler of the state, Biraja Narayan Singh Deo, was a signatory to the formation of the Indian Constitution in 1947, and the state became part of Odisha state on 13 March 1948.

John Bannerman always treasured his Highland heritage and was a native Gaelic speaker.  Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy and Glasgow High School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to Balliol College, Oxford and later to Cornell University in the United States.\n\nIn 1931 he married Ray Mundell and they had two sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was the Liberal Democrat MP, Ray Michie (later Baroness Michie of Gallanach). The historian John Bannerman was his son, and Donald Shade Munro, the rugby player and coach was his grandson.\n\nRugby union\n\nSchool and College Rugby\n\nBannerman started playing rugby union while at school, and between 1919–20, he was captain of Glasgow High School's 1st XV.\n\nBannerman was an accomplished sportsman winning a \"rugby blue\" at Oxford\n\nProvincial career\n\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1922 inter-city match.\n\nInternational career\n\nHe won 37 caps for Scotland, playing in all that country's internationals between 1921 and 1929 and was Scotland's most capped player until 1962 when Hugh McLeod surpassed his total. He played in Scotland's first “grand slam” winning team in 1925, securing this achievement by beating England in the opening match of the new Murrayfield Stadium. In 1926 he played in the Scotland team that beat England at Twickenham and France in Paris, a feat that no Scottish team would repeat until 2021, 95 years later.\n\nHe went on to become Glasgow HSFP's most capped player.\n\nAdministrative career\n\nIn 1954–55, Bannerman served as President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\n\nCareer\nIn 1930, Bannerman was appointed as a farm manager on land owned by the Duke of Montrose. In 1952 Bannerman left the Montrose estate to become a farmer in his own interests and also that year became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Festival of Britain.\n\nPolitics\nBannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. From 1942 to 1957 he was a Forestry Commissioner. In 1938 he was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Argyll. When the seat fell vacant in 1940 it was mooted that Bannerman might run as a Liberal National but the negotiations with the Conservatives broke down robbing him of his best chance of entering the House of Commons. He contested Argyll unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election and Inverness in 1950. But in 1954 he was the candidate in an extraordinary by-election at Inverness which some historians have seen as a true turning point in Liberal fortunes in Scotland and perhaps the United Kingdom. From a position where there had been no Liberal candidate in the 1951 election, Bannerman jumped into second place over Labour, coming just 1331 votes behind the Tory winner. This was the best Liberal by-election performance since the war. At the general election of 1955, Bannerman came even closer, losing by just 966 votes. Although his vote share declined in the 1959 general election, the ground had been laid for a successful attack on the seat in the 1964 general election by Russell Johnston, who held the seat until he retired from the Commons in 1997.\n\nBannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1954 to 1964 and Rector of Aberdeen University in 1957. He made other attempts to enter the Commons, including giving Labour a close run at the Paisley by-election of 1961, registering 41.3% of the vote in a seat where there had been no Liberal candidate at the 1959 general election. He tried again without success at Paisley at the 1964 general election but in December 1967 he was made Baron Bannerman of Kildonan, of Kildonan in the County of Sutherland, and so finally entered Parliament.\n\nLife peerage\nBannerman was one of three Liberals to be made life peers in 1967; the others were Tim Beaumont and John Foot. Their appointments were attacked by the Young Liberals as undemocratic. One particular critic was Tony Greaves, then editor of the Young Liberal publication Gunfire, who argued that as the Liberal Party was in favour of a new social and political order, it was quite wrong to participate in the most pathetic feature of the existing order, the House of Lords. (Greaves would become Baron Greaves of Pendle in 2000).\n\nIn his maiden speech in the Lords, Bannerman took up the Scottish cause, referring to the anger of Hamilton where the Scottish National Party had just won a parliamentary by-election; and warning it was the anger of two centuries in which the Scots had been a \"sleeping partner\" in the United Kingdom political scene.\n\nGaelic culture\nIn 1922 he won the prestigious gold medal for solo singing at the Royal National Mòd in Fort William. He was President of An Comunn Gàidhealach, the national Gaelic Society, a position previously held by his father,  from 1949 to 1954.\n\nDeath \nHe died in Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969 aged 67.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Bath, Richard (ed.)

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Johnny Hopp\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "John Leonard Hopp (July 18, 1916 – June 1, 2003) was an American professional baseball player and coach.  Born in Hastings, Nebraska, he was an outfielder and first baseman who appeared in 1,393 Major League Baseball games over 14 seasons (1939–52) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers. He threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as  tall and . He was nicknamed \"Cotney\" as a youth because of his blond (\"cotton-top\") hair.\n\nAs a Cardinal and Yankee, Hopp appeared in five World Series between  and  and was a member of the winning team in four of them.\n\nPlaying and coaching career\nHopp graduated from Hastings High School, attended Hastings College and was signed by the Cardinals in 1936. He apprenticed in their extensive farm system for four seasons, hitting over .300 three times.\n\nCardinals\nHopp made his Cardinal debut on September 18, 1939, and entered the big leagues for good the following season. During his first season as a regular, , Hopp started 75 games in the outfield and another 33 as backup first baseman to slugger Johnny Mize. He batted .303 with 135 hits, including 25 doubles and 11 triples, third in the National League. He also stole 15 bases, fifth-most in the league. Both  and  saw Hopp slump at the plate, but contribute to back-to-back Cardinal pennants. In the 1942 World Series, Hopp started all five games at first base, and although he collected only three singles in 17 at bats to the cause, St. Louis won the world championship over the New York Yankees, four games to one.\n\nThen, in , he had his best overall season. Playing as the Cardinals' everyday center fielder (in the absence of Terry Moore, who was performing World War II military service), Hopp reached career highs in hits (177), runs scored (106), doubles (35), home runs (11) and runs batted in (72); his batting average (.336) was his second-best. The Redbirds won their third consecutive National League championship. In the all-St. Louis 1944 World Series, he again started all six games and played errorless ball as the Cardinals won their second world title in three seasons, overcoming the Browns. Hopp had a relatively quiet Series at the plate, collecting five singles in 17 at bats.\n\nBraves\nThe last wartime season, , saw Hopp become the Cardinals' regular right fielder, and his batting average fell to .289 as St. Louis finished second, three games behind the Chicago Cubs. That off-season, Cardinal manager Billy Southworth moved to the Boston Braves, and with the surplus of major-league talent coming back from wartime service, Boston began purchasing players who had contributed to Southworth's successful Cardinal teams of 1940–45. They obtained Hopp for shortstop Eddie Joost and cash on February 5, 1946. The trade led to Hopp's second-most-productive campaign. Splitting time between first base and center field, he collected 148 hits and batted .333, and stole a career-high 21 bases. Selected to the 1946 National League All-Star team, Hopp started in center field at Fenway Park on July 9 and singled against Bob Feller in two at bats. It would be his only career All-Star appearance.\n\nPirates\nHopp returned to the Braves in , but was platooned in center field with right-handed-hitting Mike McCormick and his average fell to .288. That November, he was swapped to the Pirates for their center fielder, Jim Russell, in a five-player deal. Hopp would be the Pirates' regular center fielder in  and , with the exception of a three-week period in the latter season. On May 18 of that year, he was traded to the Dodgers for outfielder Marv Rackley. He appeared in eight games for Brooklyn, including two starting assignments, but went 0-for-14 at the plate, dropping his average to .174 on the season. Then, on June 7, the trade was canceled and Rackley and Hopp returned to their original clubs. Hopp responded by batting .335 with 106 hits through the rest of the season for the Pirates (raising his final average to .306). His hot streak continued in  when, as the Bucs' starting first baseman, Hopp added another 108 safeties. He was hitting .340 on September 5 when last-place Pittsburgh sent him to the Yankees in a waiver deal.\n\nYankees\nThe Yankees were then embroiled in a pennant scramble with the Detroit Tigers, and Hopp's game-winning pinch hit grand slam against the Browns on September 17 contributed to the Yankees' surge to the American League championship. He went 9-for-27 (.333) as a Yankee during that stretch drive. Allowed to participate in the World Series despite his post-August-31 acquisition, Hopp got into three games and was hitless in two at bats. He hung on in the American League as a part-time player for the next two seasons. In , Hopp was a pinch hitter and the Yankees' third-string first baseman (behind Joe Collins and Mize) and made his final World Series appearance, drawing a walk in his only plate appearance in Game 3.\n\nThe Yankees released Hopp in late May 1952 and he caught on days later with the Tigers, who had fallen all the way from pennant contention in 1950 to last place in . Appearing mostly as a pinch hitter, Hopp batted only .217 for the Tigers and retired as an active player.\n\nCareer summary\nIn his 14 MLB seasons, Hopp collected 1,262 hits, with 216 doubles, 74 triples, 46 home runs and 458 runs batted in. He hit .296 lifetime and stole 128 bases. Defensively, Hopp posted a .986 fielding percentage playing first base and all three outfield positions. Although on the winning side in four of the five World Series he played in, Hopp batted .160 (with eight hits, all singles) with no runs batted in 50 Fall Classic at bats.\n\nHis last big-league manager, Fred Hutchinson, appointed Hopp to his coaching staff with the 1954 Tigers and 1956 Cardinals.\n\nAfter baseball\nHopp then left pro baseball and returned to Hastings, where he worked for Kansas-Nebraska Energy, conducted baseball schools and was a motivational speaker. He was elected to the Lincoln Journal's Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame (1985) and the Nebraska High School Hall of Fame (1997).

His father died from tuberculosis when he was a child. He and his younger brother joined the military and after graduating from the Mikhailovsky Artillery School he was sent to serve in the 33rd artillery brigade of the Kiev Military District.\n\nFrom 1904 he was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's Bolshevik faction and spread revolutionary and anti war propaganda during the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nIn April 1905, he  was sent to an artillery unit that took part in battles with Japanese troops in Manchuria. He resigned as a lieutenant in 1906, and in 1907 by the decision of the Kiev military district court he was deprived of all the rights of a retired officer.\n\nIn 1908 he was arrested for revolutionary activity, and on 24 February 1909 was sentenced by the Kiev District Court to administrative deportation to the Yenisei province. He served exile in the village of Tikhanovo, Belskaya volost, Yenisei district.\n\nIn 1910 he  escaped from exile and emigrated abroad with forged documents. He collaborated with the Bolsheviks. A member of the 9th Congress of the Second International in 1911 and the Poroninsky meetings of the Central Committee of the RSDLP with other party cadres. He was a member of the foreign editorial board of the journal \"Education\". He lived in France and Austria during exile, collaborated with V. I. Lenin and met with Joseph Stalin.\n\nHe broke with the Bolsheviks in 1914, became a Menshevik and maintained defencist positions.\n\nIn 1917 he returned to Russia, joined the Imperial Army, took part in hostilities on the Southwestern Front.\n\nHe was elected on the Menshevik list as a deputy to the Constituent Assembly, and spoke in favor of forming a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks in the elections. At the only meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 5 January 1918, he spoke on the issue of concluding peace, while transparently hinting that the Bolsheviks were selling Russian interests in the war for \"German gold\".\n\nAt the Moscow party conference in May 1918, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Menshevik Party\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, from 1918 to 1921 he served in the Red Army and was a teacher at the School of Senior Instructors.\n\nIn July 1918 he was arrested for anti-Soviet activities and was held in the Butyrka Prison fountil his release in October. He was arrested for the second time in September 1920, and was held in prison for one month.\n\nIn the spring of 1920, when discussing Yuli Martov's report The Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Democracy, Troyanovsky drew attention to \"the need for a more detailed answer to the question\" and about the relationship between bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy\" there are no grounds for it\", and then it should be admitted \"that the only correct path to socialism is the path of Lenin.\"\n\nFrom 1921 he was in the apparatus of the People's Commissariat of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection of the RSFSR, and in 1923 he officially joined the Russian Communist Party (b).\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927 he was chairman of the Board of the Gostorg of the RSFSR and a member of the board of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade of the USSR.\n\nSoviet diplomat \nFrom 14 November 1927 to 24 January 1933 he was the Plenipotentiary Representative of the USSR in Japan.\n\nIn 1933 he was deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR.\n\nFrom 20 November 1933 to 1 October 1938 Troyanovsky served as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the USSR in the United States. The presentation of credentials to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took place not two weeks later which was the usual procedure, but the day after Troyanovsky's arrival in Washington, which was evidence of the desire of the U.S. president to emphasize special respect and attention to the country. Welcoming Troyanovsky, Roosevelt expressed his satisfaction at the appointment to the post of Soviet ambassador to Washington \"a man known for his friendly attitude towards the USA\". The years of Troyanovsky's tenure as plenipotentiary representative of the USSR were years of formation of Soviet-American relations and the first steps towards cooperation in the trade, economic, scientific and cultural fields. Troyanovsky played an important role in the conclusion of the 1935 Soviet-American trade agreement, which was renewed annually in subsequent years. Roosevelt once joked at one of the receptions in the White House: \"If Mr. Troyanovsky says, looking at the moon, that this is the sun, I personally, gentlemen, will believe him...\".\n\nHe had direct access to Stalin, to whom he reported on the strengths of American life that were considered to be adopted by the USSR.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Nitration\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "In organic chemistry, nitration is a general class of chemical processes for the introduction of a nitro group into an organic compound. The term also is applied incorrectly to the different process of forming nitrate esters between alcohols and nitric acid (as occurs in the synthesis of nitroglycerin). The difference between the resulting molecular structures of nitro compounds and nitrates is that the nitrogen atom in nitro compounds is directly bonded to a non-oxygen atom (typically carbon or another nitrogen atom), whereas in nitrate esters (also called organic nitrates), the nitrogen is bonded to an oxygen atom that in turn usually is bonded to a carbon atom (nitrito group).\n\nThere are many major industrial applications of nitration in the strict sense; the most important by volume are for the production of nitroaromatic compounds such as nitrobenzene. Nitration reactions are notably used for the production of explosives, for example the conversion of guanidine to nitroguanidine and the conversion of toluene to trinitrotoluene (TNT). However, they are of wide importance as chemical intermediates and precursors. Millions of tons of nitroaromatics are produced annually.\n\nAromatic nitration\nTypical nitration syntheses apply so-called \"mixed acid\", a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acids. This mixture produces the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the active species in aromatic nitration. This active ingredient, which can be isolated in the case of nitronium tetrafluoroborate, also effects nitration without the need for the mixed acid. In mixed-acid syntheses sulfuric acid is not consumed and hence acts as a catalyst as well as an absorbent for water.  In the case of nitration of benzene, the reaction is conducted at a warm temperature, not exceeding 50 °C.  The process is one example of electrophilic aromatic substitution, which involves the attack by the electron-rich benzene ring:\n\nAlternative mechanisms have also been proposed, including one involving single electron transfer (SET).\n\nScope\nSelectivity can be a challenge in nitrations because as a rule more than one compound may result but only one is desired, so alternative products act as contaminants or are simply wasted. Accordingly, it is desirable to design syntheses with suitable selectivity; for example, by controlling the reaction conditions, fluorenone can be selectively trinitrated or tetranitrated.\n\nThe substituents on aromatic rings affect the rate of this electrophilic aromatic substitution. Deactivating groups such as other nitro groups have an electron-withdrawing effect. Such groups deactivate (slow) the reaction and directs the electrophilic nitronium ion to attack the aromatic meta position. Deactivating meta-directing substituents include sulfonyl, cyano groups, keto, esters, and carboxylates. Nitration can be accelerated by activating groups such as amino, hydroxy and methyl groups also amides and ethers resulting in para and ortho isomers.\n\nThe direct nitration of aniline with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, according to one source, results in a 50/50 mixture of para- and meta-nitroaniline isomers. In this reaction the fast-reacting and activating aniline (ArNH2) exists in equilibrium with the more abundant but less reactive (deactivated) anilinium ion (ArNH3+), which may explain this reaction product distribution. According to another source, a more controlled nitration of aniline starts with the formation of acetanilide by reaction with acetic anhydride followed by the actual nitration. Because the amide is a regular activating group the products formed are the para and ortho isomers. Heating the reaction mixture is sufficient to hydrolyze the amide back to the nitrated aniline.\n\nIn the Wolffenstein–Böters reaction, benzene reacts with nitric acid and mercury(II) nitrate to give picric acid.\n\nIpso nitration\nWith aryl chlorides, triflates and nonaflates ipso substitution can take place as well in so-called ipso nitration. The phrase was first used by Perrin and Skinner in 1971 in an investigation into chloroanisole nitration  In one protocol, 4-chloro-n-butylbenzene is reacted with sodium nitrite in t-butanol in the presence of  0.5 mol% Pd2(dba)3, a biarylphosphine ligand and a phase-transfer catalyst to 4-nitro-n-butylbenzene.\n\nSee also \n Menke nitration\n Zincke nitration\n Reactive nitrogen species\n\nReferences \n\nNitration reactions\nSubstitution reactions", "machine_text": " Nitration Nitration is the process of adding nitro groups to a molecule. The most common method is to treat a nucleophilic organic compound, such as aniline or cyclohexane, with nitric acid (HNO3). The attack of the nucleophile on the nitronium ion results in the addition of a nitro group to the organic molecule. Nitration can also be accomplished using other nitronium sources, such as nitromethane, nitroethane, and nitrous oxide. Because the nitronium ion is relatively weakly basic, its concentration in these mixtures is very low. The low concentration and the presence of other functional groups that may react with the nitronium ion makes the use of these nitronium sources difficult for nitration of complex organic molecules. The mechanism of nitration is based on the formation of a nitronium ion from nitric acid. The nitronium ion is a good leaving group and is able to replace the leaving group in the organic molecule. In the case of a nucleophilic organic compound, the leaving group is often a halide, such as chloride or bromide. The replacement of the leaving group by the nitronium ion results in the addition of the nitro group to the organic molecule. In the case of an electrophilic organic compound, the leaving group is often a carboxylate, such as acetate or propionate. The replacement of the leaving group by the nitronium ion results in the addition of the nitro group to the organic molecule. The addition of the nitro group to an organic molecule often results in a change in the properties of the molecule. In many cases, the nitro group increases the acidity of the molecule. This is because the nitro group is a strong acidic group. In addition, the nitro group can also change the reactivity of the molecule. In many cases, the nitro group can increase the electrophilic character of the molecule. This can make the molecule more reactive to electrophilic reagents, such as acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. The nitration of organic molecules is a common reaction in organic chemistry. It is used to make a variety of different organic molecules, including amino acids, explosives, and dyes.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 692867}

Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where \"decisions\" will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game.\n\nThe game incorporates many new and returning elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. \"Hunter Sense\" returns, and now upon finding evidence, the player creates a flashback in the form of a black-and-white moving image of the animal's last known location and what that animal was doing. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player, such as animals now having some of the most improved and most realistic AI in any game, meaning they could easily see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can now randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, so the player's \"killer instinct\" slow-motion mode activates, turning the player towards the animal to shoot before it lands a hit. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations) to avoid females, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals are calm and can't detect you, medium-pitched beeps indicate that animals are starting to detect your presence, and high-pitched beeps tell the player that animals have clearly spotted the player and they are about to run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force that could disturb the animals appears and the player must kill the target in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain number of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons.\n\nThe game also features multiplayer where players can create or customize their own map from a template (based on campaign or gallery) or from scratch. Players can place trees, foliage, water, terrain formations, and animals found in the game or create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends with online connectivity. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped bolt-action hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, target, which you can use to practice your marksmanship by shooting wood cutouts of animal targets, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game was released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller.\n\nStory\nTwenty-five-year-old John Sharp, a rookie big game hunter, is invited to participate in the Cabela's 2012 International Safari hosted by John Hathcock, a high-ranking member of the Order of Orion, an elite club of world-class big game hunters from all over the world. The player starts in Montana, Sharp's homeland, where he hunts red deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, and hunt an elk before wolves scare it away. The next day a wounded mountain lion terrorizes the area, and Sharp must kill it. The player heads to Mexico, where he hunts whitetail, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer. After taking shelter in an arroyo during a sandstorm, Sharp finds boot tracks, confident that someone trespassed into his zone. Just as he's approaching a bison herd, a rifle fires and misses, scaring them off. It's revealed Matisse fired, trying to make Sharp miss his chance. The two argue, but Hathcock shames them.\n\nThen the player goes to Hathcock's private ranch in Texas, hunting white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, wild boar, bison, and moose. The radio gets a distress call from Freidkin, with Hathcock telling Sharp to check it out. Sharp finds that Freidkin's stand was knocked over by a startled bison, making him fall 70 feet down into a gorge. Sharp must then defend him from meat-craving boars until medical assistance arrives. Freidkin is taken to a hospital, where his left leg is amputated, making him drop out. The player goes to Namibia, where he hunts blackbuck, impala, zebra, wildebeest, greater kudu, White rhino and Cape buffalo. Sharp comes across lion tracks, confirming that a hunting pride is scouring the area. Sharp hears as Cassidy alerts everyone that he and his kill are surrounded by lions. As Cassidy starts to panic, Sharp instructs him to abandon his trophy and jump into a nearby ravine. There are several roars and a scream as several birds are flushed from the trees. Sharp runs to the site, finding nothing but Cassidy's rifle and pack with smears of blood. Sharp sees the male lion in the distance, and must dispatch the lionesses. He's then ambushed by the lion, and as he's about to kill Sharp a shot fires, and the lion pauses and falls to his side. Sharp sits up and sees Matisse, revealing he shot the lion for himself, saving his life. Authorities scour the area, but Cassidy's body is never found.\n\nThe player and Matisse finally go to Kodiak Island in Alaska, the final location as an approaching Arctic blizzard threatens the cancel the tournament. Meanwhile, a man-eating grizzly bear named Bloody Ben has been terrorizing the island for the last decade, and poses a huge threat to the hunters, spectators, and game animals in the area. The player hunts red deer, Sitka deer, elk, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In the midst of the blizzard, Sharp finally finds Ben's tracks, and just as he's about to shoot, a man jumps in front of his scope, revealed to be Matisse. He aggravates the bear by shooting twice, but is mauled. Sharp runs to Matisse, badly injured and passed out. Sharp is then startled by the bear, and jumps to the ground for his rifle as Bloody Ben closes in for the kill. Sharp kills Ben after shooting him 6 times in his vitals. Matisse wakes up, only to see Sharp looking at him with a confident smirk and Bloody Ben dead behind him. Matisse admits defeat to Sharp and apologizes for everything he's done. Sharp then sells Ben's skin to the Order, and he uses the money to go to Hawaii the next summer. The game ends.\n\nTrivia \nThe Cape buffalo is misidentified as a water buffalo, and the trophy score one has four horns in the photo.\nThe golden eagle is the only small game animal that will give you a penalty if shot at.\nThis game is the first appearance of the gray wolf, bison, wild boar, zebra and wildebeest in the Big Game Hunter series.\nThis is the only Cabela's game to feature the UTD.\nThis is the last Big Game Hunter series game released on the Wii.\nAll international versions of the game were localized in Activision's Dublin office.\n\n2011 video games\nCabela's video games\nHunting video games\nVideo games developed in Slovakia\nPlayStation 3 games\nWii games\nXbox 360 games\nVideo games set in Africa\nVideo games set in North America", "machine_text": " Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 is a hunting video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and is the latest installment in the Big Game Hunter series.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Used to Love (Martin Garrix and Dean Lewis song)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "\"Used to Love\" is a song by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and Australian singer Dean Lewis. It was released on 31 October 2019, through Garrix's Netherlands-based record label Stmpd Rcrds, and exclusively licensed to Epic Amsterdam, a division of Sony Music. The remixes pack was released on 20 December 2019 and an acoustic version on 14 February 2020.\n\nThe song was nominated for Most Performed Australian Work and Most Performed Dance Work at the APRA Music Awards of 2021\n\nBackground \nIn May 2019, when Garrix injured his ankle, his doctors ordered him to take two weeks off before resuming his tour.\nAfter his surgery, his friend and co-producer Albin Nedler visited him at the hospital. At that time the DJ confessed to him that he was writing the song from afar with Dean Lewis. A few days later, the singer came to Amsterdam, Netherlands to finish writing it and start recording it. When he arrived on 17 June, Garrix and Lewis shared their meeting with their fans by posting a photo of themselves on Instagram. It showed them in a short boat hanging out by the water canals in Amsterdam and was accompanied by the comment \"I live for days like this!\" left by Garrix. In the studio, Lewis played the role of singer and guitarist. He had just finished a long tour that injured his voice, which led him to save it for the second day of recordings and start by recording his guitar parts. He later claimed that the chorus of \"Used to Love\" is one of the highest vocal lines and that the single is one of the most challenging ones he has worked on. When he recorded his vocals he was led to make several attempts to get the right vocal balance and the right notes without forcing his voice. During the following months, both artists were busy creating new music in Garrix's studio based in Amsterdam. Then, from 7 to 8 September was taking place Garrix's fifth anniversary of Lollapalooza Berlin. It was at this time that the DJ officially revealed that the song was set to be released at the end of October. To accompany his announcement, he added, \"This track was made during my break while I was recovering from my ankle injury. Dean and I are super excited to share it with the world!\" On 25 October, he posted via his social media the cover of the song, unveiling its release date. After the release, Dean Lewis talked about his collaboration, saying:\n\nGarrix felt it was amazing to make the song with Lewis, who he considers as \"a good friend and an exciting talent\". He added that the singer wrote deeply personal lyrics accompanied by a timeless style of music during the development of the track.\n\nCritical reception \nKatie Bain of Billboard wrote that Garrix and Lewis paid homage to American singer Bruce Springsteen with the lyrics \"we had Springsteen playing so loud\" in their track. She felt the song swelling and compelling \"in the same style as many of Springsteen's biggest and most grandiose hits\", noting that \"Lewis' soaring vocals add to the effect\" and that \"all these elements making yet another bonafide smash from the EDM hitmaker\". Writing for Dancing Astronaut, Farrell Sweeney noted the presence of \"an energy-building violin line and acoustic elements\" resulting from a song \"vocal-led by Lewis's impassioned vocals, while Garrix foregoes a heavy electronic emphasis, trading it in for a subtle production backdrop accented with acoustics\". Mike Wass of Idolator deemed the song \"an emotional banger\" and \"a duo's genre-blurring bop\", containing Dean Lewis vocals \"over piano keys and strummed guitar\". Writing for Your EDM, Matthew Meadow said that the track is \"usual Garrix fare, with some quaint vocal chops in the drop and a non-intrusive melody\". According to him, the singer voice \"never really stands out from the production, which itself never really reaches any sort of crescendo\". He also spotted similarities with Martin Garrix previous songs, such as \"No Sleep\" or \"There for You\", but noted that \"Used to Love\" showed off \"a more mellow side to his sound, rather than the firework-inducing main stage bangers most people know him for\". In an article written later he remarked that releasing the single on Halloween day was \"a bit of an odd choice for such an uplifting song as this\". Phil Scilippa of EDM.com noted that the song \"retains an optimistic vibe, while the lyrics themselves are quite nostalgic and sad\". He called the single \"a future bass inspired sound\" endowed with \"an uplifting vivacity\" thanks to \"Lewis' piano parts and vocals\" which \"are the cherry on top\" and giving to the song \"a bright and summery feeling\".\n\nMusic video \nThe official music video of the song was released at the same day through Martin Garrix's YouTube channel. It shows Lewis with his piano, while Garrix plays the guitar.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCredits and personnel \nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\n Martin Garrix  – production, composition, lyrics, guitar, master engineering, mix engineering\n Albin Nedler – co-production, composition, lyrics, backing vocals\n Dean Lewis – lead vocals, composition, lyrics, guitar\n Kristoffer Fogelmark – composition, lyrics\n Eelco Bakker – drums\n Tom Myers – drums\n Alex Bennison – guitar\n Rob Bekhuis – vocal engineering\n Frank van Essen – strings, string arrangement\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2019 singles\n2019 songs\nMartin Garrix songs\nDean Lewis songs\nFuture bass songs\nSongs written by Martin Garrix\nSongs written by Dean Lewis\nSongs written by Kristoffer Fogelmark\nStmpd Rcrds singles\nSongs written by Albin Nedler", "machine_text": " Used to Love (Martin Garrix and Dean Lewis song) \"Used to Love\" is a song by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and Australian singer Dean Lewis. The song was released on 17 June 2022 as the sixth single from Garrix's fourth studio album, Energy. \"Used to Love\" is a future house song written by Garrix, Lewis, James Arthur, Tom Martin, and Tony Mack. The track is built around Arthur's vocals, which were recorded for a previous, unfinished collaboration. Mack and Martin received a songwriting credit after Garrix and Lewis used the same lyrics and melody. The song is additionally produced by Garrix, Lewis, and Mack. \"Used to Love\" was released via Garrix's Dutch record label Stmpd Rcrds, which is under exclusive license to Sony Music Entertainment.

The two had been looking to work on a track together for some time, and after Garrix played Lewis his previous work with James Arthur, the latter agreed to collaborate. According to Garrix, the track was completed in a single session. \"Used to Love\" is built around a vocal sample from an unfinished Arthur track, which was never released. The song's instrumental is based on a riff that Garrix played on his piano, and features additional production and arrangement from Tony Mack. The track's title was inspired by a line from Arthur's lyrics, which mention a \"love that used to be\". ## Music video The music video for \"Used to Love\" was released on 17 June 2022, the same day as the song.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Wengernalp Railway\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Wengernalp Railway (, WAB) is a  long rack railway line in Switzerland. It runs from Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald via Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, making it the world's longest continuous rack and pinion railway. The name refers to the alpine meadow of Wengernalp, above Wengen.\n\nThe line is normally operated in two sections, with trains from either direction terminating at Kleine Scheidegg. At the latter station, most passengers transfer to the Jungfrau Railway for the continuation of the journey to the highest railway station in Europe at Jungfraujoch. There are generally no roads to Wengen/Mürren, and the train is the main access.\n\nThe line is owned by the Wengernalpbahn AG, a subsidiary of the Jungfraubahn Holding AG, a holding company that also owns the Jungfraubahn and Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen–Mürren, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn. Through that holding company it is part of the Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1875, the first plans for a railway on the route later taken by the Wengernalp line were drawn up, but the high projected costs meant that the concession expired. Fifteen years later, in 1890, Leo Heer-Bétrix gained a new 80-year concession to build and operate the railway. The Wengernalpbahn was founded.\n\nConstruction work commenced in 1891, and the following year the first steam locomotive reached Wengen on 18 April and Kleine Scheidegg on 10 August. The full length of the line, from Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald, opened on 20 June 1893 as a summer only service.\n\nThe electrification of the line between Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg was completed on 3 June 1909 using 1500 V DC, with electric locomotives positioned, for safety reasons, at the lower end of the trains. The section between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg followed on 24 June 1910. Steam operation ceased in 1912.\n\nOn 7 July 1910, a new route, longer but less steep, was opened between Lauterbrunnen to Wengen. The older route was retained for nearly a hundred more years, being finally decommissioned and dismantled in 2009 because of the steep gradient of 25% and concern over geological stability on parts of the route.\n\nIn 1913, winter operations commenced between Lauterbrunnen to Kleine Scheidegg, followed by year round operations over the same section in 1925. Winter operations between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg started in 1934, followed by year round operations in 1960.\n\nIn 1942, the headquarters of the railway moved from Zurich to Interlaken. In 1947, the first motorcoaches were purchased. The following year the partly underground turning triangle at Kleine Scheidegg was constructed.\n\nIn 1990, an avalanche shelter was built on the Lauterbrunnen side of the operation, whilst in 1995 Wengen station was rebuilt to include a freight delivery terminal. In 2005, Wengernalp station platforms were extended from 127 m to 181 m usable length. In 2011, a new double track loop was opened between Wengen and Allmend, allowing the introduction of a clock-face timetable between Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg.\n\nOperations \n\nThe line is built to 800 mm gauge ( gauge), and uses the Riggenbach rack system, as modified by Arnold Pauli. Modern stock uses Strub rack system.\n\nNowadays, most passenger trains are made up of railcars, the powered car still being positioned at the lower end of the train, and so train compositions do not usually cross Kleine Scheidegg to travel directly from Lauterbrunnen over to Grindelwald. However, a triangular junction specially built into the mountainside at Kleine Scheidegg allows the train to be turned if necessary so that it can also be used on the other side of the col. The newest of these trains reach 28 km/h on the steepest stretch.\n\nAt peak periods, additional trains can be put into operation at short intervals ahead of the scheduled train, allowing capacity to be optimised according to demand. This demands an extremely flexible organisation procedure and enormous care and attention with regard to dispatching trains. Since most of the line is single track, the extra trains display a green disk with a diagonal white line on the front to indicate to station staff and signal operators that there is a train following in the same direction\n\nThe busiest stretch of railway runs from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen as this is also used to transport goods to traffic-free Wengen.\n\nThe railway operates two workshops at Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald Grund.\n\nStations \nThe line serves the following stations:\n Lauterbrunnen\n Wengwald\n Wengen\n Allmend\n Wengernalp\n Kleine Scheidegg\n Alpiglen\n Brandegg\n Grindelwald Grund\n Grindelwald\n\nTimetables \nA regular interval timetable is operated between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg with trains running every half-hour morning and afternoon, except between late October and mid December when the service is hourly. Journey time is 33 minutes up and 39 minutes down.\n\nBetween Lauterbrunnen and Wengen, trains run all year every half-hour until early evening, followed by an hourly service. During mornings and afternoons they continue to Kleine Scheidegg, again half-hourly except between late October and mid December when the service is hourly. Journey time is 43 minutes up and 50 minutes down.\n\nBefore December 2011, the Lauterbrunnen - Wengen - Kleine Scheidegg service was formed of 5 trains running at irregular intervals in every 2-hour period. Journey times varied between 44 and 51 minutes up and 54 and 60 minutes down.\nFollowing the construction of the new loop between Wengen and Allmend, the number of trains in each direction has been reduced from 5 to 4 in each 2-hour period, but departure and journey times have been standardised.\n\nBetween December and March, extra trains are run on some evenings between Grindelwald and Alpiglen to carry passengers to the floodlit Eiger Run sledging course.\n\nRolling stock\n\nLocomotives\n\nRailcars \nThe earliest railcars still in service, numbers 101 and 102 ( BDhe 4/4, built by SLM/BBC ) date from 1947, No.102 being refurbished 1985. Of the other 14 cars of this class, No's. 104 and 106–118, built between 1954 and 1964, which still survive, ten have been refurbished (all except 104 / 7 / 9 / 10) since 2000. No. 114 was refurbished along with 102 in 1985 but was returned to works in 2002 to be brought up to the newer specifications.\n\nIn 1970 a new class of railcar ( BDhe 4/4 ) was introduced, numbered 119 to 124, built by a consortium of SIG, SLM, SAAS and BBC. These were refurbished in 1998.

It runs from Lauterbrunnen to a station at the foot of the Wengen Alps, and was opened in 1890. The line runs for 5.33 km, and has a total of 33 stops. The Wengernalp Railway is the only rack and pinion railway in Switzerland, and was the first electric railway to be built in the country. The line was constructed to provide a link between the village of Wengen and the Lauterbrunnen valley. The line was designed by Robert Gerwig, and was built by the Wengernalp Railway Company, which was formed in 1886. The company was taken over by the Wengen AG in 1922, and the line was then sold to the Jungfraubahn AG in 1963. The Wengernalp Railway uses a Fell rack system, and is powered by a 1,000 volt DC electricity supply. The line has two sections of track, which are connected by a rack section. The first section runs for 2.55 km, and the second for 2.78 km. The gradient of the line is 1 in 2.5, and the maximum speed is 10 km/h. The Wengernalp Railway is operated by the Wengen AG, and is integrated into the Bernese Oberland Transport Network. The line is served by trains running between Lauterbrunnen and Wengen, and by trains running between Grindelwald and Wengen. The line also provides a connection to the Jungfrau Railway at the Kleine Scheidegg station.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 224252}

It is a kind of controlled vocabulary for describing the way in which a document is constructed, rather than what it says. DSD is a very simple idea, but is powerful when used in document management, automatic processing, and searching. The basic idea is to describe the nesting of blocks in the document, and the properties of the blocks. A document is considered to be a set of blocks that are nested within each other. The block structure can be represented by a tree. Each block in the tree may have an associated set of properties. The outermost block of a document is called the root block. A root block may have an unlimited number of child blocks, which are called sub-blocks. Sub-blocks may in turn have an unlimited number of child blocks. This nesting of blocks may continue to an arbitrary depth. Each block in the document can be assigned a set of properties. For example, a block could be labeled as \"heading\", \"paragraph\", or \"table\". Some of these properties may be inherited from parent blocks. A set of properties can be combined to form a block type. A block type defines a set of properties and their values, and this type can then be assigned to one or more blocks in the document.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1545534}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Larry Eustachy\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Larry Robert Eustachy (born December 1, 1955) is an American college basketball coach, most recently the head coach of the Colorado State Rams  He was previously the head coach at Idaho      and  \n\nEustachy was the AP Coach of the Year in 2000 after leading Iowa State to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament.\n\nCoaching career\n\nIdaho\nAt age 34, Eustachy became a head coach at Idaho in April 1990, succeeding Kermit Davis, who left the Palouse for Texas A&M after consecutive Big Sky titles and NCAA tournament appearances. He had been an assistant in Moscow for a season (1986–87) under Tim Floyd, and Eustachy's first-year salary as head coach was $52,500. In his third year, he led the Vandals to the regular season championship in 1993, but they lost the tourney title game at home. Idaho was not selected for the NIT, and Eustachy departed a few days later.\n\nUtah State\nEustachy took over the reins in Logan in March 1993, and had a very successful five-year stretch at Utah State; his teams won the Big West regular season three times and won the conference tournament in 1998. The Aggies were seeded thirteenth in the West region of the NCAA tournament, and fell to Maryland in the first round at Sacramento.\n\nIowa State\nEustachy was named head coach at Iowa State in late July 1998, after Tim Floyd left for the NBA's Chicago Bulls. Following a lackluster first season, the Cyclones had their best season in school history in 2000. They won a school record 32 games and came within one game of the Final Four, and Eustachy was named AP Coach of the Year. After consecutive Big 12 Conference titles in 2001, he signed a contract extension that, with incentives, made him the highest-paid state employee in Iowa.\n\nSuspension and resignation\nOn April 28, 2003, The Des Moines Register carried pictures of Eustachy kissing several young women and holding a beer at a party near the University of Missouri's campus just hours after the Tigers defeated his Cyclones on Tuesday, January 21. The Register also reported that Eustachy had been seen at a fraternity party at Kansas State hours after his team lost to the Wildcats. On April 30, athletic director Bruce Van De Velde suspended Eustachy with pay and recommended that he be fired for violating a morals clause in his contract. Eustachy held a press conference in which he apologized for his behavior and admitted he had recently begun rehab treatment for alcoholism. He initially indicated he would contest the suspension, but announced his resignation on May 5.\n\nDuring the scandal, the Register reported that Iowa State documents showed that the NCAA cited Eustachy for rules violations related to paying players, including Jackson Vroman, for making free throws.\n\nSouthern Mississippi\nOn March 25, 2004, after a year out of coaching, Eustachy was hired as head coach at Southern Miss. In 2008, he took a leave of absence on January 9 to be with his ailing mother. Following the 2008–09 season, he returned his $25,000 bonus from the university, saying that after a disappointing season, he did not feel as though he had earned it.\n\nIn 2011, Southern Miss went 21–10 and 9–7 in Conference USA play.  The team failed to receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament and turned down invites to the CBI and CIT.\n\nOn February 25, 2012, Eustachy recorded his 400th career victory.\n\nColorado State\nOn April 12, 2012, Eustachy left Southern Miss and was introduced as the 19th head basketball coach in Colorado State history, after Tim Miles left for Nebraska of the Big Ten Conference. Eustachy inherited a senior-laden roster that featured four returning starters and Minnesota-transfer Colton Iverson. The Rams were coming off a 20–12 season in which they made the NCAA Tournament and lost to Murray State in the second round. CSU greatly improved in rebounding and defensively, leading to a historic season for the program. CSU cracked the top 25 rankings for the first time since 1954 during the season. At 11–5 the Rams finished second in the Mountain West, their highest finish in program history. For the second straight year, the Rams earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, this time as a No. 8 seed against Missouri. The Rams defeated the Tigers 84–72 to give Eustachy his first NCAA Tournament win since the Elite Eight run at Iowa State. It was CSU's first Tournament win since 1989 and a program record 26th win. CSU lost in the third round to top-seeded Louisville, ending the season 26–9.\n\nIn August 2013, Eustachy signed a new contract to become the highest-paid coach in the Mountain West Conference. He has a base salary of $910,000 per year and will increase by two percent each following season, along with bonuses on top of it.\n\nIn 2017, Eustachy recorded his 500th career victory on January 7. On March 5, he was named Mountain West Conference Coach of the year, after leading a CSU team with only seven available players to a second place conference finish in the MWC.\n\nIn February 2017, The Coloradoan revealed that a 2014 Colorado State internal investigation recommended Eustachy's firing due to creating a culture of fear and intimidation by emotionally and verbally abusing his players and staff. However, Colorado State retained Eustachy and required him to attend anger management sessions, apologize to his team, and follow a zero-tolerance policy for directing profane language towards others or throwing or hitting objects, for which violations would result in termination for cause.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, Colorado State placed Eustachy on administrative leave and promoted associate head coach Steve Barnes to interim head coach pending the completion of another inquiry into Eustachy's behavior. Colorado State confirmed the existence of that second investigation three days earlier on January 31; Eustachy resigned on February 26.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Southern Miss profile\n \n Sports-Reference.com – Larry Eustachy\n\n1955 births\nLiving people\nAmerican men's basketball coaches\nAmerican men's basketball players\nBasketball coaches from California\nBasketball players from California\nBall State Cardinals men's basketball coaches\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach alumni\nCitrus Owls men's basketball coaches\nCitrus Owls men's basketball players\nCollege basketball controversies in the United States\nCollege men's basketball head coaches in the United States\nColorado State Rams men's basketball coaches\nIdaho Vandals men's basketball coaches\nIowa State Cyclones men's basketball coaches\nMississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball coaches\nSportspeople from Alameda, California\nPeople from Arcadia, California\nSouthern Miss Golden Eagles basketball coaches\nUtah State Aggies men's basketball coaches\nUtah Utes men's basketball coaches", "machine_text": " Larry Eustachy (born August 8, 1961) is an American college basketball coach and a former player.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Ron Gardenhire\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Ronald Clyde Gardenhire (born October 24, 1957) is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played as a shortstop for the New York Mets from 1981 through 1985. After another year playing in the minor leagues, he served as a manager in the Minnesota Twins farm system for three years, then as a coach for the Twins from 1991 through 2001, and then as the Twins' manager from 2002 through 2014, winning the American League Manager of the Year Award in 2010. He then coached for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2017 and managed of the Detroit Tigers from 2018 through most of 2020, when he retired from baseball.\n\nEarly life\nRon Gardenhire was born to a military family at the U.S. Army base in Butzbach, West Germany. While growing up, he expected to join the military, but his passion for baseball was also encouraged by his father.  The family later settled in Oklahoma where he attended Okmulgee High School and college at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nPlaying career\nThe New York Mets drafted Gardenhire in the sixth round of the 1979 amateur draft. He played for the Mets for five seasons, from 1981 to 1985. During his playing career, Gardenhire played shortstop, second base, and third base. He was plagued by injuries, especially to his hamstring. Only twice did he play in more than 70 games in a season, in 1982 and 1984. Following the 1986 season he was traded to the Minnesota Twins, where he played one season for their Triple-A affiliate before retiring as a player.\n\nGardenhire stood six feet (183 cm) tall, and weighed 175 (79 kg) pounds during most of his baseball playing career.\n\nManagerial career\n\nMinor leagues\nFor three years after he retired as a player (1988–90), Gardenhire was a manager in the Minnesota farm system, leading teams in the Class A Midwest League and Class AA Southern League to one second- and two first-place finishes.\n\nMinnesota Twins\nOn January 4, 2002, Gardenhire was named manager of the Twins, replacing Tom Kelly, who had won two World Series titles with the Twins. In contrast to Kelly's relatively calm, Bud Grant-like coaching style, Gardenhire was a very active and aggressive manager, frequently exiting the dugout to argue with umpires, leading some to joke that \"Gardy\" got ejected more times in a season than Kelly did in his entire career. In his 13 seasons managing the Twins, Gardenhire was ejected 73 times. An early 2006 television commercial for the Twins pokes fun at this, showing Gardenhire arguing with an office worker planning to go home after work rather than go to the Twins game.\n\nHeading into Gardenhire's first season as team manager, the Twins had not been to the postseason since their World Series championship in 1991, and had barely escaped being dissolved entirely by a contraction plan that was aborted by a court ruling which binded the team to their lease with the Metrodome. Under Gardenhire, the Twins had a turnaround season in 2002 as they won the American League Central division and made it to the 2002 American League Championship Series.\n\nIn thirteen seasons as the Twins' manager, Gardenhire's team had a losing record five times (2007, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), and won the division six times (the Twins lost a one-game playoff to the Chicago White Sox to determine the division champion at the end of the 2008 season). Despite all of the team's regular season success under Gardenhire, the Twins advanced to the American League Championship Series only once – his first season, in 2002 – and did not reach the World Series. In Gardenhire's tenure as the manager of the Twins, the team posted a playoff record of 6 wins and 21 losses. He was the first manager in major league history to take a team to the playoffs six times in a tenure and never make it to the World Series (Bob Melvin joined him in 2020), and he is one of just five managers with at least four playoff appearances to never appear in one.\n\nGardenhire won the American League Manager of the Year Award in 2010 and finished as runner-up for the award in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009 while leading the Twins. He finished third in the voting in 2002, his first season as manager. Gardenhire's five runner-up finishes are tied with Tony La Russa, who won the award outright an additional four times. In 2009, he received the Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, Gardenhire signed a contract extension that kept him as the Twins' manager through the 2011 season. On November 18, 2010, the Twins announced a two-year contract extension through 2013. In October 2012, after two consecutive 90 plus loss seasons, Gardenhire was not given a contract extension past the 2013 season. On September 30, 2013, despite having another 90 plus loss season for the third year in a row, Gardenhire was given a two-year extension, through 2015. He had 998 career wins at the end of the 2013 season.\n\nGardenhire earned his 1,000th managerial victory on April 5, 2014 with a 7-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field. He became the 60th manager in major league history to top one thousand wins. Gardenhire is only the tenth manager to accomplish this feat with only one team, joining the Twins' previous manager, Tom Kelly, on that list.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, Gardenhire was fired after 13 seasons as Twins manager and 27 years in the Twins organization. The last four years of Gardenhire's tenure were the worst in Twins' history. This included 383 losses and a record of 78-148 from August 1 to the end of the season. His overall regular season record was 1,068–1,039 and his playoff record was 6–21.\n\nDetroit Tigers\nOn October 20, 2017, it was announced that Gardenhire had signed a three-year contract to take the helm of the Detroit Tigers beginning in the 2018 season. He succeeded Brad Ausmus, who posted a 314–332 record in four seasons.\n\nIn his first game as the Tigers' manager, Gardenhire was ejected after what initially appeared to be a walk-off win in the 10th inning over the Pittsburgh Pirates was overturned on video review. The Tigers lost the game to the Pirates, 13-10, in 13 innings.\n\nOn September 19, 2020, Gardenhire announced his retirement as a manager due to health concerns.\n\nManagerial record\n\nCoaching career\n\nIn 1991, Gardenhire became the Twins' third base coach and held that post for 11 full seasons, including the team's 1991 World Series championship.\n\nGardenhire began the 2017 season as the bench coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks.  However, after the first seven games of the season, he left the team on a leave of absence for prostate cancer surgery. He was replaced by Jerry Narron, who took over as interim bench coach. After a five-week absence, Gardenhire rejoined the Diamondbacks in May.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGardenhire is married to Carol (née Kissling). The Gardenhires have three children: son Toby, and daughters Tiffany and Tara.\n\nToby Gardenhire was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 41st round of the 2005 MLB Draft, spent most of his time as a utility player, and rose as high as the AAA Rochester Red Wings, before retiring as a player. Like his father, Toby was known more for his glove than his bat. After hitting .247 in 103 games at Rochester in 2011, Toby posted a career line of .232/.291/.274 with six home runs in 533 minor league games while seeing playing time at all nine defensive positions including  innings as a pitcher.\n\nAfter a stint as the head coach for the University of Wisconsin-Stout baseball team he joined the Twins system, first with the Cedar Rapids Kernels in the Twins farm system.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Major League Baseball managers by wins\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRon Gardenhire at Ultimate Mets Database\nRetrosheet\nVenezuelan Professional Baseball League\nGardenhire bio at the Detroit Tigers' official website\n\n1957 births\nLiving people\nAmerican expatriates in West Germany\nArizona Diamondbacks coaches\nBaseball coaches from Oklahoma\nBaseball players from Oklahoma\nDetroit Tigers managers\nJackson Mets players\nLeones del Caracas players\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Venezuela\nLynchburg Mets players\nMajor League Baseball bench coaches\nMajor League Baseball players from Germany\nMajor League Baseball shortstops\nMajor League Baseball third base coaches\nManager of the Year Award winners\nMinnesota Twins coaches\nMinnesota Twins managers\nMinor league baseball managers\nNew York Mets players\nParis Dragons baseball players\nPeople from Butzbach\nPortland Beavers players\nTexas Longhorns baseball players\nTidewater Tides players", "machine_text": " Ron Gardenhire (born November 8, 1957) is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and manager.

He is the longest-tenured manager in Twins history. The Twins named Gardenhire their manager for the 2002 season, following a successful three-year run as the manager of their Triple-A team, the Edmonton Trappers. The Twins had finished in last place in the American League (AL) in 2001, their fourth straight year in the basement. The 2002 team, with few promising young players left from the glory days of the 1990s, surprised everyone by winning the AL Central Division, posting a 94–67 record. The Twins then beat the AL wild card winner, the Oakland Athletics, in the Division Series (DS), but lost to the eventual World Series champion, the Anaheim Angels, in the Championship Series (CS). The Twins finished in second place in the AL Central in 2003, despite having a winning record (83–79). In 2004, they again won the AL Central, with a 92–70 record, then beat the New York Yankees in the AL DS. However, they lost to the Cardinals in the CS, after holding a 3–1 series lead. In 2005, the Twins finished second in the AL Central, with a 80–82 record. The 2006 team finished in third place, with a 74–88 record. In 2007, the Twins finished in fourth place, with a 66–95 record. The Twins finished in second place in the AL Central in 2008, with a 84–77 record.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Adityavarman (Chalukya dynasty)\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Adityavarman (r. c. 643–645 CE) was a king of the Chalukya dynasty of Vatapi in southern India. He was a son of Pulakeshin II, who was defeated and probably killed when the Pallavas invaded and captured the Chalukya capital Vatapi. The immediate history of the dynasty after Pulakeshin's death is not clear, but inscriptions of Adityavarman and his son suggest that Adityavarman ruled a weakened Chalukya kingdom for a short period, before his younger brother Vikramaditya I defeated the Pallavas and restored the Chalukya power.\n\nBackground \n\nAdityavarman was one of the sons of the Chalukya emperor Pulakeshin II. In 642–643 CE, the Pallavas, who were the southern neighbours of the Chalukyas, invaded and captured the Chalukya capital Vatapi. Pulakeshin was probably killed in this conflict.\n\nThe history of the Chalukya dynasty over the next decade, when Pulakeshin's other son Vikramaditya I ascended the throne in c. 655, is not clear. It cannot be said with certainty if the Chalukya empire was divided among the various sons of Pulakeshin, or if his successor(s) ruled from other headquarter(s) while the Pallavas occupied Vatapi. Despite this uncertainty, Adityavarman's existence and his rule as the Chalukya king is attested by his Kurnool (Karnul) grant inscription, his son's Nelakunda grant inscription, Someshvara III's Vikramankabhyudaya, and Sarvajnatma's Samkshepa-Shariraka.\n\nThe Kurnool inscription does not mention Adityavarman's order of birth among Pulakeshin's sons, and does not mention Vikramaditya.\n\nThe 1009 CE Kantheru grant inscription of the later Chalukyas of Kalyani, who claimed descent from the Chalukyas of Badami, names Adityavarman as a son of Nedamari and a grandson of Pulakeshin II. However, this late account contains several inaccuracies, and cannot be considered as reliable.\n\nReign \n\nVikramankabhyudaya of the 12th century king Someshvara III, whose dynasty claimed descent from the Chalukyas of Vatapi, states that Adityavarman succeeded his father Pulakeshin.\n\nAccording to the Kurnool and Nelakunda inscriptions, Adityavarman bore the regnal titles Shri-prithvi-vallabha, Maharajadhiraja, and Parameshvara (\"Supreme Lord\").\n\nThe Kurnool inscription boasts that he possessed the \"supreme rule over the whole circuit of earth which had been overcome by the strength of his arm and prowess\".\n\nThe Kurnool grant inscription is dated to Adityavarman's first regnal year: historian D. P. Dikshit assumes that he may have ruled during c. 643–645 CE, spending most of his time trying to regain the former Chalukya territory from the Pallavas and other enemies. Historian D. C. Sircar theorized that Vikramaditya I and Adityavarman ruled different parts of the Pulakeshin's former empire simultaneously.\n\nIdentification as Vikramditya I \n\nHistorian T. V. Mahalingam theorized that Adityavarman was simply a former name of Vikramaditya I. His theory is based on the following arguments:\n\n Adityavarman's Kurnool inscription and Vikramaditya's Gadval inscription feature similar phraseology.\n Adityavarman's Kurnool inscription states that he made the grant for \"the merit of his mother and father and himself\". Such a statement is found in Vikramaditya's Kurnool inscriptions as well, but is uncommon in the inscriptions of other Chalukya kings. The Navsari inscription of Vikramaditya's younger brother Jayasimha also mentions that Vikramaditya \"meditated on the feet of his mother and father\": such an expression is not found in other Chalukya records.\n The Chalukya inscriptions issued after the restoration of the Chalukya power mention that Vikramaditya acquired the title Parameshvara (\"Supreme Lord\") by subjugating the hostile kings. Adityavarman also bore the title Parameshvara.\n\nHistorian D. P. Dikshit disputes this identification based on the following arguments:\n\n The similarity between the inscriptions of the succeeding kings can be explained by the fact that such records were drafted by state officials on the lines of the previous records.\n The grant inscriptions only furnish a genealogy of the king, not a chronology of succession. This explains why Adityavarman's records do not mention Vikramaditya, and vice versa.\n The records of the later Chalukyas of Kalyani, although unreliable, mention Adityavarman. Had Adityavarman not been a distinct, sovereign king, he would have been forgotten by the time of the later Chalukyas.\n The Nelakunda inscription of Adityavarman's son Abhinavaditya suggests that both men were sovereign rulers, and that Abhinavadiya succeeded Adityavarman.\n\nSuccessor \n\nThe Nelakunda inscription of Adityavarman's son Abhinavaditya gives both men the imperial title Parameshvara, which suggests that Abhinavaditya succeeded his father as the Chalukya sovereign.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n\nEarly Chalukyas", "machine_text": " Adityavarman was a Chalukya king, who ruled in the early 6th century. He was the son of king Kirttivarman and queen Bhadrechi. According to the Chronicle of the Chalukya Kings, Adityavarman ruled for a very short period, as his predecessor, his father Kirttivarman, was a very old man at the time of his death. Adityavarman was succeeded by his brother, Mangalesa. The relationship of Adityavarman with his predecessors and successors is uncertain. The Bayyaram tank inscription, issued during the reign of his son Mangalesa, describes Adityavarman as a \"son of the daughter of the king of Vatsagulma\". The Vatsagulma kings were the ancestors of the Chalukyas, but Adityavarman was not the direct heir of the Vatsagulma family. The same inscription describes Mangalesa as a \"son of the daughter of the king of Ellam\". The identity of Ellam is uncertain, but it is possible that Mangalesa was a son of a king of the Western Ganga family, who had married a daughter of the Vatsagulma king. The Peddavaduguru inscription, issued during the reign of Adityavarman's grandson Mangalesha, states that Mangalesa's mother was a Vatsagulma princess. It is possible that Mangalesa's mother was Adityavarman's sister, rather than his wife. If this interpretation is correct, then Adityavarman married into the Vatsagulma family, and Mangalesa married into the Western Ganga family. The Peddavaduguru inscription further states that Adityavarman was the son of Kirttivarman, and that his grandfather was Avinita, who was the son of a king named Jayasena. The identification of Avinita is uncertain, but he could have been a brother of the Vatsagulma king.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 59426574}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Integral linearity\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A measurement system consists of a sensor, to input the physical parameter that is of interest, and an output to a medium that is suitable for reading by the system that needs to know the value of the parameter. (This could be a device to convert the temperature of the surrounding air or water into the visually readable height of a column of mercury in a small tube, for example; but the conversion could also be made to an electronic encoding of the parameter, for reading by a computer system.)\n\nThe integral linearity is then a measure of the fidelity of the conversion that is performed by the measuring system. It is the relation of the output to the input over a range expressed as a percentage of the full-scale measurements.  Integral linearity is a measure of the device's deviation from ideal linear behaviour.\n\nThe most common denotation of integral linearity is independent linearity.\n\nIn the context of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), independent linearity is fitted to minimize the deviation with respect to the ideal behaviour with no constraints. Other types of integral linearity place constraints on the symmetry or end points of the linear fit with respect to the actual data.\n\nIn the case of position sensors, two general types exist. Differences between the two regarding independent linearity essentially relate to the type of mechanical interface - linear or rotary. For rotary position sensors, as a shaft (or in the case of magnetic sensors, a magnet) is turned over a defined mechanical range in a direction causing an increasing response, an output voltage changes from a minimum to maximum value. The variation from an ideal linear relationship as this device is changed from minimum to maximum range end-points is the independent linearity error. It is measured in a practical sense as deviation of output voltage as a percentage of input voltage with the maximum value as the range is traversed, usually being referred to in a device's specifications. The same description holds for linear position sensors except that a straight rod (or magnet) is moved along the length of the sensor or as it extends from the end of a linear position sensor.\n\nNotes\n\n \nMeasurement", "machine_text": " Integral linearity In electronics, integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of a circuit with respect to the integral of its input signal. A linear circuit is one in which the output is a linear function of the input. This means that the output is directly proportional to the input, with the proportionality constant being the gain of the circuit. circuits are the simplest type of linear circuit. In an amplifier, the output is an amplified version of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. A circuit with a gain of 10 will have an output voltage that is 10 times the input voltage. Integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of the circuit with respect to the integral of the input. An amplifier with good integral linearity will have an output voltage that is equal to the integral of the input voltage, with the gain being the ratio of the integral of the output voltage to the integral of the input voltage. For example, an amplifier with a gain of 10 will have an output voltage that is the integral of the input voltage, multiplied by 10. Good integral linearity is important in many types of circuits, including amplifiers, integrators, and differentiators. In these circuits, the output is a linear function of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output to the input. The gain is not constant, but is a function of the input signal. In order to have good integral linearity, the gain must be a linear function of the input signal. There are many ways to measure the integral linearity of a circuit. One way is to measure the gain of the circuit, and then use this gain to calculate the integral of the output voltage. The integral of the output voltage can then be compared to the integral of the input voltage to see if they are equal. Another way to measure the integral linearity of a circuit is to use a sinusoidal input signal. The output of the circuit will be a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency as the input signal, but with a different amplitude and phase. The integral of the output signal can then be compared to the integral of the input signal to see if they are equal. In general, integral linearity is a measure of the linearity of a circuit with respect to the integral of its input signal. A circuit with good integral linearity will have an output that is equal to the integral of the input, with the gain being the ratio of the output to the input. Good integral linearity is important in many types of circuits, including amplifiers, integrators, and differentiators.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 4819510}

It is a multipurpose hall where concerts, sporting events, festivals and fairs are organized. The arena was built for sport, especially track cycling, but there is now little sport there, an exception being the Diamond Games tennis.\n\nAccording to Billboard Magazine, the Sportpaleis is the second most visited event hall in the world, second only to Madison Square Garden. The Sportpaleis is known for performances by both Dutch-speaking and international artists. It also hosts the Nekka-Nacht, the Proximus Diamond Games tennis tournament for women and Pop Poll De Luxe, organised by the magazine HUMO.\n\nThe main building is 88 metres wide and 132 metres long and has a roof spanning 11.600 m². Under the stands, there is a wooden cycling track 250 meters long and 8 meters wide. The arena is elliptical and has two floors.\n\nNext to the Sportpaleis is its sister venue the Lotto Arena, a hall that can accommodate 8,000 spectators.\n\nHistory\n\nBuilding started on 11 January 1932. It lasted 21 months: on 11 September 1933, the building was completed, the largest indoor arena in Europe. The Sportpaleis was built by the Apostel-Mampaey family from Boom. They were internationally renowned velodrome builders from 1907 up until the Second World War. The velodrome builders of Boom were very much in demand. They built tracks in Gentbrugge (1911), Wilrijk ‘Garden City’ (1916), Nice and Marseille (1920), Ostend (1921-1946), Brussel-Heizel (1932) and Oudenaarde (1933). The famous ‘Kuipke’ in Ghent (1922) and the even more famous Sportpaleis in Deurne (1933). In 2008, a book \"De velodroombouwers Apostel-Mampaey\" was published.\n\nOn 29 September 1956, road cycling world champion Stan Ockers died a few days after a crash in his 116th performance at the track. The UCI Track Cycling World Championships was held at the Sportpaleis in 1969 and 2001.\n\nOn 19 November 1988, Roy Orbison gave his last performance in Europe at the Sportpaleis.\n\nJanet Jackson was scheduled to perform during her All for You Tour on 29 November 2001, but the show was cancelled along with the rest of her European tour because of possible terrorist threats. The same happened on her 2016 Unbreakable World Tour, but because of scheduling conflicts.\n\nAmerican R&B singer Beyoncé performed at the Sportpaleis as part of her The Beyoncé Experience Tour on 19 May 2007. She returned on 7 May 2009 for her I Am... World Tour and on 14 & 15 May 2013, as part of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, where she sold 33,000 tickets in just an hour. The first show on 14 May 2013 was cancelled three hours before the show and rescheduled to 31 May 2013. She subsequently beat her own record by selling 40,000 tickets in under one hour for two 2014 concerts at the venue.\n\nDutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation celebrated their 15th anniversary with a special show entitled \"Elements\" at the Sportpaleis. They were accompanied by the renowned Il Novecentro Orchestra and some special guests. The concert was held on November 13, 2012, and was sold out. Part of the concert was later released in the live album Let Us Burn – Elements & Hydra Live in Concert.\n\nOn 31 January 2015, the Antwerp Giants beat the attendance record to a basketball game in Belgium.

Only Madison Square Garden in New York had more.\n\nThe arena can hold 23,001 people after expansions in 2012 and 2013.\n\nTransport connections \n\nThe Sportpaleis lies at the R. Grégoirplein square at the crossing of two large traffic axes, the Bisschoppenhoflaan/Schijnpoortweg, having an east–west orientation, and the Burgemeester Gabriel Theunisbrug, going north over the Albert Canal. In its immediate proximity also lies the Deurne highway ramp of the R1 ring road, as well as the Singel urban ring road. Also nearby lie 3 car parks operated by the Sportpaleis, and two more car parks, of a nearby Gamma shop and the Antwerp slaughterhouse, are also available when large events are held. Even so, traffic near the Sportpaleis can get extremely dense when such events are held, leading to large traffic jams and causing nuisance with the inhabitants of the neighborhood.\n\nThe Sportpaleis is also well connected to the Antwerp public transport system. Underground, next to the Sportpaleis, lies Sport premetro station, which is serviced by tram routes 2, 3 and 6, running between either Luchtbal or Merksem to the north and the city centre and the western or southern parts of the city in the other direction, via the Antwerp premetro network. Above ground also lies the terminus of tram route 12, following an above ground trajectory toward the city centre and Zuid neighborhood to the south. In addition to these, tram route 5 also has a stop called \"Sportpaleis\" near the premetro exit at the Ten Eekhovelei to the south of the complex. The route runs between Deurne and Wijnegem to the east and the city centre and Linkeroever to the west. Finally, it is also serviced by bus lines 19 and 413.\n\nSee also\n List of tennis stadiums by capacity\n List of indoor arenas in Belgium\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n  \n\nIndoor arenas in Belgium\nTennis venues in Belgium\nVelodromes in Belgium\nSports venues in Antwerp (province)\nSport in Antwerp\nCulture in Antwerp\nBuildings and structures in Antwerp\nGymnastics venues", "machine_text": " The Sportpaleis is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the Forest District of Brussels, Belgium.

It has a standing room capacity of 21,000 and a seating capacity of 18,368. The Sportpaleis is part of the Sportpaleis Group, which also includes the Forest National concert venue and the former Sportpaleis jury headquarters in the Radio Building. The Sportpaleis was built in less than three years, and officially opened on 20 November 1970 with a match between the Belgium national football team and their Italian counterparts. The arena was built to serve as the home ground of the Belgium national team, and to provide a modern replacement for the aging Heysel Stadium. However, due to its relatively small size and the introduction of the 5-a-side football tournament in 1970, the Sportpaleis never hosted a major international tournament. The only major international competition to be held at the Sportpaleis was the final of the 1980 European Cup, which was won by Nottingham Forest against Hamburg. The Sportpaleis is also used for other large-scale events, such as concerts and shows. It has hosted several major international artists, such as the Bee Gees, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and Madonna. In 2006, the Sportpaleis was renovated and expanded to a capacity of 21,000. The renovation included the construction of a new entrance hall, a new box office, and a new restaurant. In 2008, the Sportpaleis was designated as a protected monument. In 2013, the Sportpaleis was once again renovated and expanded to a capacity of 21,300.

At the other edge, the MPLS header is removed and the original Ethernet frame is transmitted to the destination. This is called multiprotocol encapsulation because the MPLS network can also handle other protocols such as ATM, Frame Relay, and High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"GNU Compiler Collection\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most projects related to GNU and the Linux kernel. With roughly 15 million lines of code in 2019, GCC is one of the biggest free programs in existence. It has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.\n\nWhen it was first released in 1987 by Richard Stallman, GCC 1.0 was named the GNU C Compiler since it only handled the C programming language. It was extended to compile C++ in December of that year. Front ends were later developed for Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D and Go, among others. The OpenMP and OpenACC specifications are also supported in the C and C++ compilers.\n\nGCC has been ported to more platforms and instruction set architectures than any other compiler, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for many embedded systems, including ARM-based and Power ISA-based chips.\n\nAs well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern Unix-like computer operating systems, including most Linux distributions. Most BSD family operating systems also switched to GCC shortly after its release, although since then, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Apple macOS have moved to the Clang compiler, largely due to licensing reasons. GCC can also compile code for Windows, Android, iOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and DOS.\n\nHistory \nIn late 1983, in an effort to bootstrap the GNU operating system, Richard Stallman asked Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the Free University Compiler Kit) for permission to use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum advised him that the compiler was not free, and that only the university was free, Stallman decided to work on a different compiler. His initial plan was to rewrite an existing compiler from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from Pastel to C with some help from Len Tower and others. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but then realized that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64 KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch. None of the Pastel compiler code ended up in GCC, though Stallman did use the C front end he had written.\n\nGCC was first released March 22, 1987, available by FTP from MIT. Stallman was listed as the author but cited others for their contributions, including Jack Davidson and Christopher Fraser for the idea of using RTL as an intermediate language, Paul Rubin for writing most of the preprocessor, and Leonard Tower for \"parts of the parser, RTL generator, RTL definitions, and of the Vax machine description.\" Described as the \"first free software hit\" by Peter H. Salus, the GNU compiler arrived just at the time when Sun Microsystems was unbundling its development tools from its operating system, selling them separately at a higher combined price than the previous bundle, which led many of Sun's users to buy or download GCC instead of the vendor's tools. While Stallman considered GNU Emacs as his main project, by 1990, GCC supported thirteen computer architectures, was outperforming several vendor compilers, and was used commercially by several companies.\n\nEGCS fork \nAs GCC was licensed under the GPL, programmers wanting to work in other directions—particularly those writing interfaces for languages other than C—were free to develop their own fork of the compiler, provided they meet the GPL's terms, including its requirements to distribute source code. Multiple forks proved inefficient and unwieldy, however, and the difficulty in getting work accepted by the official GCC project was greatly frustrating for many, as the project favored stability over new features. The FSF kept such close control on what was added to the official version of GCC 2.x (developed since 1992) that GCC was used as one example of the \"cathedral\" development model in Eric S. Raymond's essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar.\n\nIn 1997, a group of developers formed the Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System (EGCS) to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The basis of the merger was a development snapshot of GCC (taken around the 2.7.2 and later followed up to 2.8.1 release). Mergers included g77 (Fortran), PGCC (P5 Pentium-optimized GCC), many C++ improvements, and many new architectures and operating system variants.\n\nWhile both projects followed each other's changes closely, EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, blessed EGCS as the official version of GCC, and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999. With the release of GCC 2.95 in July 1999 the two projects were once again united. GCC has since been maintained by a varied group of programmers from around the world under the direction of a steering committee.\n\nGCC 3 (2002) removed a front-end for CHILL due to a lack of maintenance.\n\nBefore version 4.0 the Fortran front end was g77, which only supported FORTRAN 77, but later was dropped in favor of the new GNU Fortran front end that supports Fortran 95 and large parts of Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 as well.\n\nAs of version 4.8, GCC is implemented in C++.\n\nSupport for Cilk Plus existed from GCC 5 to GCC 7.\n\nGCC has been ported to a wide variety of instruction set architectures, and is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary software. GCC is also available for many embedded systems, including Symbian (called gcce), ARM-based, and Power ISA-based chips. The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms, including video game consoles such as the PlayStation 2, Cell SPE of PlayStation 3, and Dreamcast. It has been ported to more kinds of processors and operating systems than any other compiler.\n\nSupported languages \n, the recent 11.1 release of GCC includes front ends for C (gcc), C++ (g++), Objective-C, Fortran (gfortran), Ada (GNAT), Go (gccgo) and D (gdc, since 9.1) programming languages, with the OpenMP and OpenACC parallel language extensions being supported since GCC 5.1. Versions prior to GCC 7 also supported Java (gcj), allowing compilation of Java to native machine code.\n\nRegarding language version support for C++ and C, since GCC 11.1 the default target is gnu++17, a superset of C++17, and gnu11, a superset of C11, with strict standard support also available. GCC also provides experimental support for C++20 and upcoming C++23.\n\nThird-party front ends exist for many languages, such as Pascal (gpc), Modula-2, Modula-3, and VHDL (GHDL). A few experimental branches exist to support additional languages, such as the GCC UPC compiler for Unified Parallel C or Rust.\n\nDesign \n\nGCC's external interface follows Unix conventions. Users invoke a language-specific driver program (gcc for C, g++ for C++, etc.), which interprets command arguments, calls the actual compiler, runs the assembler on the output, and then optionally runs the linker to produce a complete executable binary.\n\nEach of the language compilers is a separate program that reads source code and outputs machine code. All have a common internal structure. A per-language front end parses the source code in that language and produces an abstract syntax tree (\"tree\" for short).\n\nThese are, if necessary, converted to the middle end's input representation, called GENERIC form; the middle end then gradually transforms the program towards its final form. Compiler optimizations and static code analysis techniques (such as FORTIFY_SOURCE, a compiler directive that attempts to discover some buffer overflows) are applied to the code. These work on multiple representations, mostly the architecture-independent GIMPLE representation and the architecture-dependent RTL representation. Finally, machine code is produced using architecture-specific pattern matching originally based on an algorithm of Jack Davidson and Chris Fraser.\n\nGCC was written primarily in C except for parts of the Ada front end. The distribution includes the standard libraries for Ada and C++ whose code is mostly written in those languages. On some platforms, the distribution also includes a low-level runtime library, libgcc, written in a combination of machine-independent C and processor-specific machine code, designed primarily to handle arithmetic operations that the target processor cannot perform directly.\n\nGCC uses many additional tools in its build, many of which are installed by default by many Unix and Linux distributions (but which, normally, aren't present in Windows installations), including Perl, Flex, Bison, and other common tools. In addition, it currently requires three additional libraries to be present in order to build: GMP, MPC, and MPFR.\n\nIn May 2010, the GCC steering committee decided to allow use of a C++ compiler to compile GCC. The compiler was intended to be written mostly in C plus a subset of features from C++. In particular, this was decided so that GCC's developers could use the destructors and generics features of C++.\n\nIn August 2012, the GCC steering committee announced that GCC now uses C++ as its implementation language. This means that to build GCC from sources, a C++ compiler is required that understands ISO/IEC C++03 standard.\n\nOn May 18, 2020, GCC moved away from ISO/IEC C++03 standard to ISO/IEC C++11 standard (i.e. needed to compile, bootstrap, the compiler itself; by default it however compiles later versions of C++).\n\nFront ends \n\nEach front end uses a parser to produce the abstract syntax tree of a given source file. Due to the syntax tree abstraction, source files of any of the different supported languages can be processed by the same back end. GCC started out using LALR parsers generated with Bison, but gradually switched to hand-written recursive-descent parsers for C++ in 2004, and for C and Objective-C in 2006. As of 2021 all front ends use hand-written recursive-descent parsers.\n\nUntil GCC 4.0 the tree representation of the program was not fully independent of the processor being targeted. The meaning of a tree was somewhat different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified with the introduction of GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are lowered to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++, and Java front ends produce GENERIC directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.\n\nIn either case, the so-called \"gimplifier\" then converts this more complex form into the simpler SSA-based GIMPLE form that is the common language for a large number of powerful language- and architecture-independent global (function scope) optimizations.\n\nGENERIC and GIMPLE \nGENERIC is an intermediate representation language used as a \"middle end\" while compiling source code into executable binaries. A subset, called GIMPLE, is targeted by all the front ends of GCC.\n\nThe middle stage of GCC does all of the code analysis and optimization, working independently of both the compiled language and the target architecture, starting from the GENERIC representation and expanding it to register transfer language (RTL). The GENERIC representation contains only the subset of the imperative programming constructs optimized by the middle end.\n\nIn transforming the source code to GIMPLE, complex expressions are split into a three-address code using temporary variables. This representation was inspired by the SIMPLE representation proposed in the McCAT compiler by Laurie J. Hendren for simplifying the analysis and optimization of imperative programs.\n\nOptimization \nOptimization can occur during any phase of compilation; however, the bulk of optimizations are performed after the syntax and semantic analysis of the front end and before the code generation of the back end; thus a common, even though somewhat contradictory, name for this part of the compiler is the \"middle end.\"\n\nThe exact set of GCC optimizations varies from release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as loop optimization, jump threading, common subexpression elimination, instruction scheduling, and so forth. The RTL optimizations are of less importance with the addition of global SSA-based optimizations on GIMPLE trees, as RTL optimizations have a much more limited scope, and have less high-level information.\n\nSome of these optimizations performed at this level include dead code elimination, partial redundancy elimination, global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation, and scalar replacement of aggregates. Array dependence based optimizations such as automatic vectorization and automatic parallelization are also performed. Profile-guided optimization is also possible.\n\nBack end \n\nThe GCC's back end is partly specified by preprocessor macros and functions specific to a target architecture, for instance to define its endianness, word size, and calling conventions. The front part of the back end uses these to help decide RTL generation, so although GCC's RTL is nominally processor-independent, the initial sequence of abstract instructions is already adapted to the target. At any moment, the actual RTL instructions forming the program representation have to comply with the machine description of the target architecture.\n\nThe machine description file contains RTL patterns, along with operand constraints, and code snippets to output the final assembly. The constraints indicate that a particular RTL pattern might only apply (for example) to certain hardware registers, or (for example) allow immediate operand offsets of only a limited size (e.g. 12, 16, 24, ... bit offsets, etc.). During RTL generation, the constraints for the given target architecture are checked. In order to issue a given snippet of RTL, it must match one (or more) of the RTL patterns in the machine description file, and satisfy the constraints for that pattern; otherwise, it would be impossible to convert the final RTL into machine code.\n\nTowards the end of compilation, valid RTL is reduced to a strict form in which each instruction refers to real machine registers and a pattern from the target's machine description file. Forming strict RTL is a complicated task; an important step is register allocation, where real hardware registers are chosen to replace the initially assigned pseudo-registers. This is followed by a \"reloading\" phase; any pseudo-registers that were not assigned a real hardware register are 'spilled' to the stack, and RTL to perform this spilling is generated. Likewise, offsets that are too large to fit into an actual instruction must be broken up and replaced by RTL sequences that will obey the offset constraints.\n\nIn the final phase, the machine code is built by calling a small snippet of code, associated with each pattern, to generate the real instructions from the target's instruction set, using the final registers, offsets, and addresses chosen during the reload phase. The assembly-generation snippet may be just a string, in which case a simple string substitution of the registers, offsets, and/or addresses into the string is performed. The assembly-generation snippet may also be a short block of C code, performing some additional work, but ultimately returning a string containing the valid assembly code.\n\nC++ Standard Library (libstdc++) \nThe GCC project includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library called libstdc++, licensed under the GPLv3 License with an exception to link closed source application when sources are built with GCC.\nThe current version is 11.\n\nOther features \nSome features of GCC include:\n\n Link-time optimization\n Link-time optimization optimizes across object file boundaries to directly improve the linked binary. Link-time optimization relies on an intermediate file containing the serialization of some Gimple representation included in the object file. The file is generated alongside the object file during source compilation. Each source compilation generates a separate object file and link-time helper file. When the object files are linked, the compiler is executed again and uses the helper files to optimize code across the separately compiled object files.\n Plugins\n Plugins extend the GCC compiler directly. Plugins allow a stock compiler to be tailored to specific needs by external code loaded as plugins. For example, plugins can add, replace, or even remove middle-end passes operating on Gimple representations. Several GCC plugins have already been published, notably:\n The Python plugin, which links against libpython, and allows one to invoke arbitrary Python scripts from inside the compiler. The aim is to allow GCC plugins to be written in Python.\n The MELT plugin provides a high-level Lisp-like language to extend GCC.\n The support of plugins was once a contentious issue in 2007.\n C++ transactional memory\n The C++ language has an active proposal for transactional memory. It can be enabled in GCC 6 and newer when compiling with -fgnu-tm.\n Unicode identifiers\n Although the C++ language requires support for non-ASCII Unicode characters in identifiers, the feature has only been supported since GCC 10. As with the existing handling of string literals, the source file is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. The feature is optional in C, but has been made available too since this change.\n C extensions\n GNU C extends the C programming language with several non-standard-features, including nested functions and typeof expressions.\n\nArchitectures \n\nGCC target processor families as of version 11.1 include:\n\n AArch64\n Alpha\n ARM\n AVR\n Blackfin\n eBPF\n Epiphany (GCC 4.8)\n H8/300\n HC12\n IA-32 (x86)\n IA-64 (Intel Itanium)\n MIPS\n Motorola 68000\n MSP430\n Nvidia GPU\n Nvidia PTX\n PA-RISC\n PDP-11\n PowerPC\n R8C / M16C / M32C\n RISC-V\n SPARC\n SuperH\n System/390 / zSeries\n VAX\n x86-64\n\nLesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included:\n\n 68HC11\n A29K\n C6x\n CR16\n D30V\n DSP16xx\n ETRAX CRIS\n FR-30\n FR-V\n IBM ROMP\n Intel i960\n IP2000\n M32R\n MCORE\n MIL-STD-1750A\n MMIX\n MN10200\n MN10300\n Motorola 88000\n NS32K\n RL78\n Stormy16\n V850\n Xtensa\n\nAdditional processors have been supported by GCC versions maintained separately from the FSF version:\n\n Cortus APS3\n ARC\n AVR32\n C166 and C167\n D10V\n EISC\n eSi-RISC\n Hexagon\n LatticeMico32\n LatticeMico8\n MeP\n MicroBlaze\n Motorola 6809\n MRISC32\n MSP430\n NEC SX architecture\n Nios II and Nios\n OpenRISC\n PDP-10\n PIC24/dsPIC\n PIC32\n Propeller\n Saturn (HP48XGCC)\n System/370\n TIGCC (m68k variant)\n TMS9900\n TriCore\n Z8000\n ZPU\n\nThe GCJ Java compiler can target either a native machine language architecture or the Java virtual machine's Java bytecode.

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for a number of languages, mainly C, C++, and Fortran, and back ends for a number of different target architectures, including the Intel x86, PowerPC, AMD64, and SPARC families, the ARM architecture, the DEC Alpha architecture, the Motorola 68000 family, and the IBM System/370. The GCC project was started in the spring of 1991 by Richard Stallman (rms@gnu.org) and David Taylor (dt@gnu.org) to create a portable compiler for the C language. The main force behind the project was the urge to give programmers freedom to control their own computing, and to help the development of free software based on the C language. A portable C compiler had already been developed at the Free Software Foundation by Larry Wall and other people. That compiler, called GCC, was not completely compatible with the C language as specified in the 1989 ISO C standard, and it had a number of deficiencies and bugs. The new GCC was developed from scratch, but the name was chosen to preserve the association with the original GCC project. The GCC compiler generates an intermediate representation (IR) from the input C/C++/Fortran source code. The IR is a simple register-based representation that is designed to be efficiently executed by a wide variety of different target architectures. The GCC project includes a number of different target backends that are responsible for generating optimized object code for a specific architecture from the intermediate representation. The object code generated by GCC is not in a form that can be executed directly by the CPU. Rather, it must be further processed by a linker program to resolve references to globally defined objects and functions, resolve jumps to undefined addresses, and obtain the necessary run-time support for the target architecture. Such support includes a C standard library, a C++ standard library, and a Fortran runtime support library. The GCC project includes a number of different front ends for different languages. The front end is responsible for generating the intermediate representation from the input source code. Front ends exist for C, C++, Fortran, Ada, and other languages. Front ends can also be modified to generate a unique intermediate representation, which can then be processed by any of the available target backends. The GCC project is hosted by the Free Software Foundation, which provides support and administrative services for the project. GCC is free software, and can be distributed and modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. The GCC project is one of the largest and most successful free software projects. A number of commercial vendors make money by providing value-added products and services related to GCC, including support, tuning, and enhanced versions. For example, several companies sell proprietary compiler front ends that are based on GCC, and a number of vendors sell GCC-based embedded toolchains for various embedded architectures.

It is made up of three relatively large fields, Ku, Maloob, and Zaap, which are located to the immediate northwest of the Cantarell field. The field lies in  of water.\n\nKu-Maloob-Zaap is located offshore in the Bay of Campeche, off the coast of Tabasco,  from Ciudad del Carmen. It was discovered by PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, in 1979. It covers an area of , and includes five fields: Ku, Maloob, Zaap, Bacab, Lum and Zazil-Ha. \nThe Ku, Maloob, and Zaap fields produce from the Kimmeridgian, Lower Paleocene-Upper Cretaceous, and Middle Eocene reservoirs. Total reserves of the field have been put at 4.9 billion barrels.\n\nProduction history\nThe Ku field was discovered in 1980, the Maloob field in 1984 and Zaap in 1991. First oil from the Ku field was produced in 1981.\n\nThe KMZ development included drilling 82 wells, four of which are nitrogen injectors and installation of 17 oil platforms: seven drilling, four production, four accommodation, one telecommunication and one processing.  There are 42 oil pipelines of  to transport the oil produced. It was expected that by 2011, production would reach  of oil and  of natural gas.\n\nThis target was met by November 2009 when oil production reached . The field produced  crude oil in 2010. Production rose to  in November 2015. This new rate of production and the decline in production at the Cantarell Field made Ku-Maloob-Zaap Mexico's most productive oil field.\n\nKMZ is among the company’s most profitable producing assets, according to Welligence Energy Analytics. Pemex reported average production costs of $10.37/boe at KMZ as of end-2019.\n\nOn 2 July 2021, Mexico's state-owned oil company PEMEX suffered an undersea gas pipeline rupture in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap field. The leak and subsequent fire lasted for five hours.\n\nProduction decline\nProduction in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap fields has entered a declining phase. Production declined to  in July 2019. Subsequently production plunged to  in July 2020. The uncertainty created by Covid-19 contributed to the decline in production.\n\nTo maintain production in the Ku Maloob Zaap field, PEMEX has adopted techniques such as management of production limits and nitrogen injection.\n\nSee also\n\n List of oil fields\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nProyecto Ku-Maloob-Zaap, en la Sonda de Campeche\n\nOil fields in Mexico\nPemex\nGulf Coast of Mexico\nPetroleum industry in the Gulf of Mexico\nGeography of Campeche", "machine_text": " Ku-Maloob-Zaap is a Maldivian folktale about a man who captures and marries a female spirit. The folktale has several versions. The earliest version was collected by British explorer Henry Moore aboard the HMS Dryad, which was stationed in the Maldives from 1886 to 1889. Moore published his version in The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891. The story is set in the island of Meedhoo in Raa Atoll, Maldives. The protagonist, a young man named Nulhaam, lives with his sister and brother-in-law. Nulhaam's sister is very kind to him, while his brother-in-law is a cruel and evil man, who beats Nulhaam and forces him to do household chores. One day, Nulhaam goes fishing in a canoe. He paddles to the north of the island, to a place where no one has ever caught any fish. Nulhaam casts his net, and pulls out a golden fish. The fish tells Nulhaam that it is the only one of its kind, and if it is killed all the other fish will become golden as well. Nulhaam releases the fish, but it swims away saying that one day it will come back to help him. After Nulhaam returns to the island, his brother-in-law asks him what he has caught. Nulhaam says that he has caught a golden fish, but the brother-in-law does not believe him and beats him for lying. The next day, the brother-in-law goes fishing and catches nothing, even though many fish are swimming in the area. He asks Nulhaam what he has caught, and Nulhaam says that he has caught a golden fish. The brother-in-law does not believe him and beats him again. On the third day, the brother-in-law goes fishing again and catches nothing. He asks Nulhaam what he has caught, and Nulhaam says that he has caught a golden fish. The brother-in-law believes him and asks Nulhaam to show him where he has been fishing. Nulhaam takes the brother-in-law to the north of the island, where he had caught the fish. The brother-in-law tells Nulhaam to catch the fish again, and Nulhaam catches the same fish. This time, the brother-in-law does not beat Nulhaam, but he takes the fish to the king and tells him that Nulhaam has caught a golden fish.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Screw\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "A screw and a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below) are similar types of fastener typically made of metal and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in a matching part. \n\nScrews are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and  prevents pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; materials commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.\n\nExplanation\nA screw is a combination of simple machines: it is, in essence, an inclined plane wrapped around a central shaft, but the inclined plane (thread) also comes to a sharp edge around the outside, which acts a wedge as it pushes into the fastened material, and the shaft and helix also form a wedge at the point. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, called a female thread (internal thread), often in the form of a nut object with an internal thread.  Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted.  The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.\n\nA screw will usually have a head on one end that allows it to be turned with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include a screwdrivers and a wrench. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions. A carriage bolt has a domed head that is not designed to be driven.  A set screw may have a head the same size or smaller than the outer diameter of the screws thread; a set screw without a head is sometimes called a grub screw. A J-bolt has a J-shaped head that is sunk into concrete to serve as an anchor bolt. \n\nThe cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the pitch.\n\nMost screws and bolts are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.\n\nDifferentiation between bolt and screw\n\nThere is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of \"screws\", nuts would not be expected to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows:\n\nThis distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for screw and bolt.\n\nThe issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with Machinery's Handbook distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:\n\nWood screws \nEarly wood screws were made by hand, with a series of files, chisels, and other cutting tools, and these can be spotted easily by noting the irregular spacing and shape of the threads, as well as file marks remaining on the head of the screw and in the area between threads. Many of these screws had a blunt end, completely lacking the sharp tapered point on nearly all modern wood screws. Eventually, lathes were used to manufacture wood screws, with the earliest patent being recorded in 1760 in England. During the 1850s, swaging tools were developed to provide a more uniform and consistent thread. Screws made with these tools have rounded valleys with sharp and rough threads. Some wood screws were made with cutting dies as early as the late 1700s (possibly even before 1678 when the book content was first published in parts).\n\nOnce screw turning machines were in common use, most commercially available wood screws were produced with this method. These cut wood screws are almost invariably tapered, and even when the tapered shank is not obvious, they can be discerned because the threads do not extend past the diameter of the shank. Such screws are best installed after drilling a pilot hole with a tapered drill bit. The majority of modern wood screws, except for those made of brass, are formed on thread rolling machines. These screws have a constant diameter, threads with a larger diameter than the shank, and are stronger because the rolling process does not cut the grain of the metal.\n\nMachine screws \nASME standards specify a variety of \"Machine Screws\" in diameters ranging up to .  These fasteners are often used as bolts with nuts, but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts).  They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction.  In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.\n\nHex cap screws \nASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws whose size range is  in diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts.  Machinery's Handbook refers parenthetically to these fasteners as \"Finished Hex Bolts\". Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document Distinguishing Bolts from Screws, the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 \"Fastener Quality Act\" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the \"Finished Hex Bolts\" and renamed them the \"Hex Cap Screw\"—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.\n\nLug bolts and head bolts \nThese terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction they would be screws.  Here common terms are at variance with Machinery's Handbook distinction.\n\nLag screw \n\nLag screws (US) or coach screws (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also referred to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. The head is typically an external hex. Metric hex-headed lag screws are covered by DIN 571. Inch square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 4 to 20 mm or #10 to 1.25  in (4.83 to 31.75 mm), and lengths from 16 to 200 mm or  or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).\n\nThe materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag screws are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and for other heavy carpentry applications.  The attributive modifier lag came from an early principal use of such fasteners: the fastening of lags such as barrel staves and other similar parts.\n\nThese fasteners are \"screws\" according to the Machinery's Handbook criteria, and the obsolescent term \"lag bolt\" has been replaced by \"lag screw\" in the Handbook. However, to many tradesmen, they are \"bolts\", because they are large, with hex or square heads.\n\nUnited States government standards \nThe federal government of the United States made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw, because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms \"coarse\" and \"fine\" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to \"high-quality\" or \"low-quality\", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).\n\nHistorical issue \nOld USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to consider this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that \"a bolt by definition takes a nut\". Using a coach \"bolt\" as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The carriage bolt passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.\n\nControlled vocabulary versus natural language \nThe distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.\n\nThe word bolt is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.\n\nIn common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called \"bolts\" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called \"screws\". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.\n\nOther distinctions\nBolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction.  And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them.  However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.\n\nA possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to.  This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.  On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.\n\nTypes of screws and bolts\n\nThreaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are generally designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.\n\nFasteners with a tapered shank\n\nFasteners with a non-tapered shank\n\nFasteners with built in washers\nA fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.\n\nOther threaded fasteners\n\nSuperbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner \nA superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer.  Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced.  Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.\n\nBone screws\n\nThe field of screws and other hardware for internal fixation within the body is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves some of the highest technology for fasteners, as well as some of the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary screw drive types (some not seen outside of these applications).\n\nList of abbreviations for types of screws\n\nThese abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, knowing that \"FH\" means \"flat head\", it may be possible to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing \"FH\".\n\nThese abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.\n\nThe extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.\n\nMaterials\n\nScrews and bolts are usually made of steel. \nWhere great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.\n\nGalvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. \nSome types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.\n\nOften a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.\n\nSelection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.\n\nMechanical classifications\nThe numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8 (500) = 400 MPa.\n\nUltimate tensile strength is the tensile stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.\n\nMild steel bolts have property class 4.6, which is 400 MPa ultimate strength and 0.6*400=240 MPa yield strength. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8, which is 800 MPa ultimate strength and 0.8*800=640 MPa yield strength or above.\n\nThe same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.\n\nMetric \n\nThe international standards for metric externally threaded fasteners are ISO 898-1 for property classes produced from carbon steels and ISO 3506-1 for property classes produced from corrosion resistant steels.\n\nInch \nThere are many standards governing the material and mechanical properties of imperial sized externally threaded fasteners.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from carbon steels are ASTM A193, ASTM A307, ASTM A354, ASTM F3125, and SAE J429.  Some of the most common consensus standards for grades produced from corrosion resistant steels are ASTM F593 & ASTM A193.\n\nScrew head shapes\n\n  A low disc with a rounded, high outer edge with large surface area.\n Button or  Cylindrical with a rounded top.\n  A dome-shaped head used for decoration.\n Mushroom or  Lower-profile dome designed to prevent tampering.\n Countersunk or  Conical, with flat outer face and tapering inner face allowing it to sink into the material. The angle of the screw is measured as the aperture of the cone.\n Oval or  A decorative screw head with a countersunk bottom and rounded top. Also known as \"raised countersunk\" in the UK.\n  Similar to countersunk, but there is a smooth progression from the shank to the angle of the head, similar to the bell of a bugle.\n  Disc with cylindrical outer edge, height approximately half the head diameter.\n  Cylindrical, but with a slightly convex top surface. Height to diameter ratio is larger than cheese head.\n  A flanged head can be any of the above head styles (except the countersunk styles) with the addition of an integrated flange at the base of the head. This eliminates the need for a flat washer.\n\nSome varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.\n\ns \n\nModern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.\n\nTools\n\nThe hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and torque-limiting screwdrivers are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a spanner (UK usage) or wrench (US usage), while a nut setter is used with a power screw driver.\n\nThread standards\n\nThere are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.\n\nISO metric screw thread\n\nThe basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimetres (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25 mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. \"M8×1\" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).\n\nThe nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1 mm, is made by threading a 6 mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm).\n\nMetric hexagon bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in International Standards ISO 4014, ISO 4017, and ISO 4032. The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximum width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):\n\nIn addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:\n\nBear in mind that these are just examples and the width across flats is different for structural bolts, flanged bolts, and also varies by standards organization.\n\nWhitworth\n\nThe first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.\n\nThe most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4\" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8\" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with \"thread adapters\" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4\" UNC bolts fit 1/4\" BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60° and 55° respectively.\n\nBritish Association screw thread\n\nBritish Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as \"2BA\", \"4BA\" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order—it may be suspected—to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 \"Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A.\"\n\nWhile not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6 mm diameter and 1 mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch  mm (0.65 mm) and diameter  mm (3.62 mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.\n\nBA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.\n\nBA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result, many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.\n\nUnified Thread Standard\n\nThe Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes  inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16.  The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + (0.013 × number).  For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + (0.013 × 4) = 0.060 + 0.052 = 0.112 inches in diameter.  There are also screw sizes smaller than \"0\" (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought – seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of \"ought\" size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by 0.013 and subtract from 0.060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is .060 – (3 x .013) = 0.060 - 0.039 = .021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.\n\nManufacture\n\nThere are three steps in manufacturing a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.\n\nThe blanks are then polished again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via thread rolling; however, some are cut. The workpiece is then tumble finished with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing. For most screws, a coating, such as electroplating with zinc (galvanizing) or applying black oxide, is applied to prevent corrosion.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile a recent hypothesis attributes the Archimedes' screw to Sennacherib, King of Assyria, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the Hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a Greek invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath Archimedes.  Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.\n\nEarlier, the screw had been described by the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum (428–350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.\n\nRybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called \"turnscrews\" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, tournevis) have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners had become commodified, as detailed below.\n\nThere were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and \"clinch bolts\" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.\n\nThe metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws (meaning screws made of metal to be used in wood) in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).\n\nThe first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735–1800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he  invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.\n\nThese developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. Standardization of threadforms began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.\n\nIn 1821, the first screw factory in the United States was built by Hardman Philips on Moshannon Creek, near Philipsburg for the manufacture of blunt metal screws. An expert in screw manufacture, Thomas Lever was brought over from England to run the factory. The mill was run by steam and water power, and the fuel used was hardwood charcoal. The screws were made from wire prepared by “rolling and wire drawing apparatus” from iron manufactured at a nearby forge. The screw mill was not a commercial success. It eventually failed due to competition from the lower cost, gimlet-pointed screw and ceased operations in 1836. \n\nThe American development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and  served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was popularized by American Henry F. Phillips.\n\nThreadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.\n\nPrecision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution. They are key components of micrometers and lathes.\n\nOther fastening methods\nAlternative fastening methods are:\n\n nails\n rivets\n pins (dowel pins, taper pins, roll pins, spring pins, cotter pins)\n pinned shafts (keyed shafts, woodruff keys, gibb-headed key)\n screw bolt, pin bolt or cotter bolt, and clench bolt- as used in clinker boat building\n welding\n soldering\n brazing\n joinery (mortise & tenon, dovetailing, box joints, lap joints)\n gluing\n taping\n clinch fastening\n\nSee also\n\n Bolted joint\n Dowel\n Fastener\n Gender of connectors and fasteners\n Syndesmotic screw\n Tap and die\n Die head\n Thread angle\n Threaded fastener\n Threaded insert\n Threaded rod (e.g. studs, allthread)\n Threading\n Thread-locking compound\n Thread pitch gauge\n Wall plug\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n How the World Got Screwed\n NASA-RP-1228 Fastener Design Manual\n Imperial/Metric fastening sizes comparison\n \"Hold Everything\", February 1946, ''Popular Science\" article section on screws and screw fastener  technology developed during World War Two\n How to feed screws and dowels\n\nMetalworking\n \nWoodworking\nArticles containing video clips", "machine_text": " Screw (orman-dane) A screw is a type of fastener, in some ways similar to a bolt, typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, called a male thread. Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. Screws are used in many applications, such as to fasten metal parts together and to fasten metal to wood. In these applications, screws have largely replaced nails, where nails are still used. The largest user of screws is the residential housing industry, where screws are used both to fasten wood to wood and to fasten metal to wood. The basic design of a screw can be divided into four parts: the head, the neck, the body, and the tip. The head is the part of the screw that is used to turn it. The head can be a variety of shapes, such as a button or a cross. In some applications, such as with a screw driver, the head can be a standard shape so that a variety of different screws can be turned with the same tool. The neck is the unthreaded part of the screw that is directly below the head. It is typically used to attach the head to the body. The body is the part of the screw that is threaded for most of its length. The body typically has a constant diameter, although some screws, such as lag screws, have a tapered body. The tip is the end of the screw that is opposite the head. The tip is typically pointed to allow the screw to be started in a surface. There are many different types of screws, all designed for different applications. Common types of screws include: Wood screws: used to fasten wood to wood and wood to metal Metal screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood Self-tapping screws: used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole, sometimes called sheet metal screws Thread-forming screws: used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood, also called thread-rolling screws Lag screws: used to fasten wood to wood Security screws: used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened In addition, there are many variants of the basic screw design, including: Screws with a variety of head designs Screws with a variety of body designs Screws with a variety of tip designs Screws used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood are sometimes called metal screws. Metal screws are similar to wood screws, except that the shaft is threaded for most of its length. Metal screws can be used with nuts or screwed directly into a threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Machine screws are similar to metal screws, except that they are designed to be used with a nut or threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. Self-tapping screws are used to fasten metal to metal without the need for a pilot hole. They are sometimes called sheet metal screws. Thread-forming screws are used to fasten metal to metal and metal to wood. They are also called thread-rolling screws. Screws used to fasten wood to wood are sometimes called wood screws. Wood screws are similar to metal screws, except that the shaft is not threaded for most of its length. Wood screws are designed to be used with a pilot hole. Lag screws are similar to wood screws, except that they have a much thicker shaft and a blunt tip. They are used to fasten wood to wood. Security screws are designed to be used to fasten a device so that it can not be easily unfastened. Security screws are typically used to fasten a license plate to a car or to fasten the cover of a computer port. A screw is used to fasten things together by turning it in the direction that causes the screw to dig in and wedge into a material. The screw is typically inserted into a pre-drilled hole, and as the screw is turned, the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that allows it to hold. The first use of screws to fasten metal is believed to have been in the 15th century, in the Visby ship. Screws were used to hold pieces of wood together in the 17th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to wood in the 18th century. Screws were used to fasten metal to metal in the 19th century.

It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s. \n\nThe name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.\n\nThe area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.\n\nFarmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nUnincorporated communities in Alachua County, Florida\nUnincorporated communities in Florida", "machine_text": " Arredondo, Florida Arredondo is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Johns County, Florida, United States, located on the northern side of State Road 210 between I-295 and US 1. The population was 1,523 at the 2010 census. Arredondo is located in the Jacksonville metropolitan area. The name \"Arredondo\" is a corruption of the Spanish name \"Aredondo\", which means \"along the river\". This area was first settled by the Spanish in the early 18th century. A redoubt was constructed south of the mouth of the Arredondo River (renamed the St. Johns River in the 19th century) in 1736 to protect the river approach to St. Augustine, the capital of Spanish Florida. The redoubt was named Fort Arredondo after Don Arredondo, the Spanish governor of Florida from 1734 to 1737. The fort was attacked by British forces led by General Oglethorpe in the Battle of Fort Arredondo, a victory for the British. The fort was destroyed by British forces in 1739 during their retreat from the area after the Battle of St. Augustine. The area was resettled by the Spanish in the late 18th century, and a community was established at the site of the former fort. A small village was located at the intersection of the Arredondo River and the St. Johns River, near the present-day San Marco neighborhood in Jacksonville. The area was purchased by the Florida East Coast Railway in the early 20th century for the construction of the railroad. The community of Arredondo was located near the present-day Arredondo Railroad Overpass. The railroad was constructed south of the St. Johns River in the early 1920s, and the community of Arredondo was gradually abandoned. The railroad was acquired by the Florida East Coast Railway in 1961. The population of Arredondo was 1,995 at the 2000 census. The median age was 32 years.

It appears to be an early temple from soon after 900 AD, and the presence of other temples indicates that it was an important site at that time. The surviving central shrine holds an image of dancing Shiva; all the Yogini images are, uniquely, similarly shown dancing.\n\nTemple\n\nThe Chausath Yogini Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century in Ranipur-Jharial, in an isolated position some miles from the towns of Titilagarh and Kantabanjhi in Balangir district, Odisha, is a circular, hypaethral, 64-yogini temple made of sandstone, some 50 feet in diameter. 62 of the yogini images survive. The site, on an outcrop of rock, must have been important, given the presence of a large temple built of brick and several small temples of stone. The primary entrance is an opening in the circular wall towards the east; unlike at the Hirapur yogini temple, there was once a further opening towards the south, now filled in.\n\nRanipur-Jharial was the first of the Yogini temples to be discovered; it was described by Major-General John Campbell in 1853.\n\nShrine to Shiva and Chamunda\n\nAt the centre of the temple is the original shrine with four pillars, holding an image of Nateshwar, Shiva as Lord of Dance. The Shiva images is three-faced and eight-armed, and is depicted with urdhva linga, an erection. Elephant-headed Ganesh and the bull Nandi are shown in the image's base. The similar-sized image of the goddess Chamunda in the temple may once have been housed with Shiva in the central shrine.\n\nYogini images\n\nThe Ranipur Jharial Yoginis are made, like the temple walls, of a low-quality coarse sandstone, which has weathered poorly; they were once finely-carved. Uniquely, all the Yogini images are depicted poised about to dance, in the karana pose of Indian classical dance; Vidya Dehejia explains that the posture is taken up at the start of each group of movements. Like the Hirapur temple, but unlike other Yogini temples, there are no Matrikas, mother goddesses, among the Yoginis. 14 of the Yoginis are animal-headed; among them can be seen goddesses with the heads of a cat, an elephant, a snake, a horse, a buffalo, an antelope, and seemingly also of a leopard and a sow. The leopard-headed goddess is holding up a human corpse, suggestive of the corpse rituals (shava sadhana) of the Yogini cult. The absence of haloes or attendant figures as at later Yogini temples suggests that this temple was built relatively early.\n\nThe 19th century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham described two further Yogini images. One, uniquely, had the attributes of the Sun-god, Surya; she had two arms, a lotus flower in each hand, and seven horses. The other (now surviving only from the knees down) was dancing on a reclining male; she had 6 or 8 arms, and was depicted pulling her mouth open wide; she held a skull-cup, a kettle-drum, and a sword.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n  \n\nHindu temples in Odisha\nBalangir district\n9th-century_Hindu_temples\nArchaeological monuments in Odisha\nShakti temples", "machine_text": " Chausath Yogini Temple, Ranipur Jharial The Chausath Yogini Temple, also known as the Chausath Mata Temple, is a Hindu temple located in the village of Ranipur Jharial, in the state of Bihar, India, on the bank of the Son River.

A variation of the dish called blinde vink is made by wrapping ground veal in a thin veal cutlet. Slavinken and blinde vinken are usually prepared and bought at the butchery or the supermarket; a standard slavink, before cooking, weighs around 100 grams. The bacon is \"glued\" to the filling with transglutaminase, an enzyme that bonds proteins (and is usually extracted from animal blood).\n\nThe slavink was first created by Butcher Jaap Boerwinkel in Amersfoort, and subsequently given its name by butcher Spoelder in Laren, which won him an award, the \"Golden Butcher's Ring.\" Originally, the filling of a slavink was made from smoked sausage. The term \"slavink\" loosely translates to Lettucefinch. The term is probably an abbreviation of slagersvink, that is, a \"finch\" prepared by the butcher (\"slager\").\n\nThe slavink often emblematizes traditional Dutch cuisine, as in the book De taal van de verpleging, a Dutch-language guide for non-native nurses working in the Netherlands, and is especially favored by the older generations.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nDutch cuisine\nDutch words and phrases\nPork dishes\nBacon dishes", "machine_text": " Slavink is a name used by several artists, including: 1.

His later years were devoted to the production of animated cartoons in Canada. After firing Shamus Culhane from the animator's supervising director job on Rocket Robin Hood, director Ralph Bakshi and background artist Johnnie Vita were brought to Toronto, not knowing that Krantz and producer Al Guest were in the middle of a lawsuit.\n\nFailing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. Bakshi's animation studio, Bakshi Productions, took over Rocket Robin Hood and another Krantz-produced series, Spider-Man, beginning Krantz' working relationship with Bakshi.\n\nBy 1968, Krantz was producing live-action shows (such as the Canadian supernatural series Strange Paradise). Krantz agreed to produce Bakshi's animated film Heavy Traffic, but told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. Bakshi later pitched a film adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip Fritz the Cat, and Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. Krantz later acquired the film rights through Crumb's then-wife, Dana, who had Crumb's power of attorney and signed the contract. Fritz the Cat was released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Krantz began coproducing Heavy Traffic with Samuel Z. Arkoff, but Krantz had not compensated Bakshi for his work on Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, \"The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's just a lot of noise.\" Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. When Bakshi attempted to work with Albert S. Ruddy on another film, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio and called several directors, including Chuck Jones, in search of a replacement. Arkoff threatened to withdraw his financial backing unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, which Krantz did a week later.\n\nAfter 1974, live-action motion pictures dominated Krantz' filmography. He wrote two novels, including Laurel Canyon (Pocket Books, 1979, paperback original), which was a best-seller.\n\nPersonal life\nKrantz married magazine writer Judith Tarcher on February 19, 1954. In the mid-1970s, as Judith Krantz, she began her career as a best-selling novelist. Judith's first book, Scruples, was published in 1978, and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\nThe couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas. Tony is a film and television writer, director and producer.\n\nHis sister-in-law is puppeteer and ventriloquist Shari Lewis, who is famous for performing Lamb Chop.

The series starred Francesca Annis as Julia, a former MI5 agent who has been forced into retirement due to her age and a back injury. To make ends meet, Julia takes a job as a dinner lady at a local school, and is also offered a small flat by her old friend and colleague George (Nia Roberts). Although Julia is keen to start a new life, she is unable to shake off her previous career as a spy, and finds herself drawn into a world of intrigue and danger when she discovers that George's flat is actually a front for a local spy cell, and that her friends are not all who they seem. The series was originally conceived as a vehicle for Francesca Annis, who had previously appeared in another BBC spy drama, The New Avengers, in the mid-1970s. The New Avengers had been a success in Britain, but had not been particularly well-received by the American networks, who had therefore refused to consider any spin-off series featuring the character of Cathy Gale. This left British writer David Collison (who had also written for The New Avengers) to develop a new concept for a thriller series, which eventually became Someone to Watch Over Me. The series was initially produced by independent company Spooksville, but after the first series was completed, the BBC took over production. The series was shot on location in London, with many scenes being filmed around the city's Docklands area. Someone to Watch Over Me was not a major critical success, but it did gain a small cult following, and the first series was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Antares\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Antares (pronounced  ), designated α Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii), is on average the fifteenth-brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a slow irregular variable star that ranges in brightness from apparent magnitude +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as \"the heart of the scorpion\", Antares is flanked by σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii near the center of the constellation.\n\nClassified as spectral type M1.5Iab-Ib, Antares is a red supergiant, a large evolved massive star and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye.  Its exact size remains uncertain, but if placed at the center of the Solar System, it would reach to somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its mass is calculated to be around 12 times that of the Sun.\n\nAntares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association, the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, located at the rim of the Upper Scorpius part illuminating the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex in its foreground. Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the association, which contains thousands of stars with a mean age of 11 million years, about  from Earth.\n\nAntares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, but it is actually a binary star, with its two components called α Scorpii A and α Scorpii B.  The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot main sequence star of magnitude 5.5.\n\nNomenclature\n\nα Scorpii (Latinised to Alpha Scorpii) is the star's Bayer designation. Antares has the Flamsteed designation 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the Bright Star Catalogue and HD 148478 in the Henry Draper Catalogue. As a prominent infrared source, it appears in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Sky Survey Atlas catalogue as IRAS 16262–2619. It is also catalogued as a double star WDS J16294-2626 and CCDM J16294-2626.  Antares is a variable star and is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate variable star designation.\n\nIts traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek , meaning \"rival to-Ares\" (\"opponent to-Mars\"), due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars. The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early Mesopotamian astronomers which is considered an outdated speculation because the name of this star in Mesopotamian astronomy has always been \"heart of Scorpon\" and it was associated with Goddess Lisi(n). Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after Antar, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems Mu'allaqat. However, the name \"Antares\" is already proven in the Greek culture, e.g. in Ptolemy's Almagest and Tetrabiblos. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Antares for the star α Scorpii A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nObservation \nAntares is visible all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at opposition to the Sun. Antares then rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator.\n\nFor two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky from mid-northern latitudes, because it is near conjunction with the Sun. In higher northern latitudes, Antares is only visible low in the south in summertime. Higher than 64° northern latitude, the star does not rise at all.\n\nAntares is easier to see from the southern hemisphere due to its southerly declination. In the whole of Antarctica, the star is circumpolar as the whole continent is above 64° S latitude.\n\nHistory \nRadial velocity variations were observed in the spectrum of Antares in the early 20th century and attempts were made to derive spectroscopic orbits.  It became apparent that the small variations could not be due to orbital motion, and were actually caused by pulsation of the star's atmosphere.  Even in 1928, it was calculated that the size of the star must vary by about 20%.\n\nAntares was first reported to have a companion star by Johann Tobias Bürg during an occultation on April 13, 1819, although this was not widely accepted and dismissed as a possible atmospheric effect.  It was then observed by Scottish astronomer James William Grant FRSE while in India on 23 July 1844. It was rediscovered by Ormsby M. Mitchel in 1846, and measured by William Rutter Dawes in April 1847.\n\nIn 1952, Antares was reported to vary in brightness.  A photographic magnitude range from 3.00 to 3.16 was described.  The brightness has been monitored by the American Association of Variable Star Observers since 1945, and it has been classified as an LC slow irregular variable star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies between extremes of +0.6 and +1.6, although usually near magnitude +1.0. There is no obvious periodicity, but statistical analyses have suggested periods of 1,733 days or  days. No separate long secondary period has been detected, although it has been suggested that primary periods longer than a thousand days are analogous to long secondary periods.\n\nResearch published in 2018 demonstrated that Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal people from South Australia observed the variability of Antares and incorporated it into their oral traditions as Waiyungari (meaning 'red man').\n\nOccultations and conjunctions \n\nAntares is 4.57 degrees south of the ecliptic, one of four first magnitude stars within 6° of the ecliptic (the others are Spica, Regulus and Aldebaran), so it can be occulted by the Moon. The occultation of 31 July 2009 was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares. Lunar occultations of Antares are fairly common, depending on the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar nodes. The last cycle ended in 2010 and the next begins in 2023. Shown at right is a video of a reappearance event, clearly showing events for both components.\n\nAntares can also be occulted by the planets, e.g. Venus, but these events are rare. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will be November 17, 2400. Other planets have been calculated not to have occulted Antares over the last millennium, nor will they in the next millennium, as most planets stay near the ecliptic and pass north of Antares. Venus will be extremely near Antares on October 19, 2117 and every eight years thereafter through to October 29, 2157 it will pass south of the star.\n\nIllumination of Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex \nAntares illuminates foreground parts of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The illuminated cloud is sometimes referred to as the Antares Nebula or is otherwise identified as VdB 107, Ced 132, DG 141, LBN 1107 and Magakian 668.\n\nStellar system\nα Scorpii is a double star that is thought to form a binary system. The best calculated orbit for the stars is still considered to be unreliable.  It describes an almost circular orbit seen nearly edge-on, with a period of 1,218 years and a semi-major axis of about .  Other recent estimates of the period have ranged from 880 years for a calculated orbit, to 2,562 years for a simple Kepler's Law estimate.\n\nEarly measurements of the pair found them to be about  apart in 1847–49, or  apart in 1848.  More modern observations consistently give separations around . The variations in the separation are often interpreted as evidence of orbital motion, but are more likely to be simply observational inaccuracies with very little true relative motion between the two components.\n\nThe pair have a projected separation of about 529 astronomical units (AU) (≈ 80 billion km) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the distance between them. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is over  beyond the primary (more than 110 billion km).\n\nAntares\n\nAntares is a red supergiant star with a stellar classification of M1.5Iab-Ib, and is indicated to be a spectral standard for that class. Due to the nature of the star, the derived parallax measurements have large errors, so that the true distance of Antares is approximately  from the Sun.\n\nThe brightness of Antares at visual wavelengths is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the true bolometric luminosity is around 100,000 times that of the Sun. There is a large margin of error assigned to values for the bolometric luminosity, typically 30% or more. There is also considerable variation between values published by different authors, for example  and  published in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe mass of the star has been calculated to be about , or . Comparison of the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest a progenitor mass of  and an age of 12 million years (MYr), or an initial mass of  and an age of 11 to 15 MYr. Massive stars like Antares are expected to explode as supernovae.\n\nLike most cool supergiants, Antares's size has much uncertainty due to the tenuous and translucent nature of the extended outer regions of the star. Defining an effective temperature is difficult due to spectral lines being generated at different depths in the atmosphere, and linear measurements produce different results depending on the wavelength observed. In addition, Antares appears to pulsate, varying its radius by 19%. It also varies in temperature by 150 K, lagging 70 days behind radial velocity changes which are likely to be caused by the pulsations.\n\nThe diameter of Antares can be measured most accurately using interferometry or observing lunar occultations events. An apparent diameter from occultations 41.3 ± 0.1 milliarcseconds has been published. Interferometry allows synthesis of a view of the stellar disc, which is then represented as a limb-darkened disk surrounded by an extended atmosphere. The diameter of the limb-darkened disk was measured as  in 2009 and  in 2010. The linear radius of the star can be calculated from its angular diameter and distance. However, the distance to Antares is not known with the same accuracy as modern measurements of its diameter.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite's trigonometric parallax of  leads to a radius of about . Older radii estimates exceeding  were derived from older measurements of the diameter, but those measurements are likely to have been affected by asymmetry of the atmosphere and the narrow range of infrared wavelengths observed; Antares has an extended shell which radiates strongly at those particular wavelengths. Despite its large size compared to the Sun, Antares is dwarfed by even larger red supergiants, such as VY Canis Majoris or VV Cephei A and Mu Cephei.\n\nAntares, like the similarly sized red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion, will almost certainly explode as a supernova, possibly in the next ten thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.\n\nAntares B\nAntares B is a magnitude 5.5 blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares.  It is assumed to be a relatively normal early-B main sequence star with a mass around , a temperature around , and a radius of about .\n\nAntares B is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over . It is often described as green, but this is probably either a contrast effect, or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar occultations while Antares is hidden by the Moon.  Antares B appears a profound blue or bluish-green color, in contrast to the orange-red Antares.\n\nEtymology and mythology\n\nIn the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, \"the Breast of the Scorpion\". In MUL.APIN, which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and denotes the breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara. Later names that translate as \"the Heart of Scorpion\" include  from the Arabic قَلْبُ ٱلْعَقْرَبِ . This had been directly translated from the Ancient Greek  .  was a calque of the Greek name rendered in Latin.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Antares may have been known by various names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri (\"the Lord of the Seed\"), Kak-shisa (\"the Creator of Prosperity\"), Dar Lugal (\"The King\"), Masu Sar (\"the Hero and the King\"), and Kakkab Bir (\"the Vermilion Star\"). In ancient Egypt, Antares represented the scorpion goddess Serket (and was the symbol of Isis in the pyramidal ceremonies). It was called tms n hntt \"the red one of the prow\".  \n\nIn Persia Antares was known as Satevis, one of the four \"royal stars\". In India, it with σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii were Jyeshthā (the eldest or biggest, probably attributing its huge size), one of the nakshatra (Hindu lunar mansions).\n\nThe ancient Chinese called Antares 心宿二 (Xīnxiù'èr, \"second star of the Heart\"), because it was the second star of the mansion Xin (心). It was the national star of the Shang Dynasty, and it was sometimes referred to as () because of its reddish appearance.\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand call Antares Rēhua, and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rēhua is father of Puanga/Puaka (Rigel), an important star in the calculation of the Māori calendar. The Wotjobaluk Koori people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as Djuit, son of Marpean-kurrk (Arcturus); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (Balayang) as the brother of Bunjil (Altair).\n\nIn culture \n\nAntares appears in the flag of Brazil, which displays 27 stars, each representing a federated unit of Brazil. Antares represents the state of Piauí.\n\nIn Saint Seiya, the popular 1986 manga, the character Milo represents the Scorpius constellation and uses moves and attacks named after its stars - being Antares the strongest one.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Best Ever Image of a Star’s Surface and Atmosphere - First map of motion of material on a star other than the Sun\n\nM-type supergiants\nB-type main-sequence stars\nBinary stars\nSlow irregular variables\nUpper Scorpius\n\nScorpius (constellation)\nAstronomical events in the near future\nScorpii, Alpha\nCD-26 11359\nScorpii, 21\n148478 9\n080763\n6134\nStars with proper names\nTIC objects", "machine_text": " Antares Antares is the brightest star in the constellation of Scorpius.

The name Antares is derived from the Greek α̊ νταρες α̊ (antares), which means \"rival of Mars\", as it was the star that was thought to most closely rival Mars in brightness. In ancient Greece, Antares was sometimes called Huh, meaning \"the star\". Antares is a red supergiant of spectral type M1 III. It has a mass of approximately 700 times that of the Sun. Its radius is approximately 800 times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is about 3,500 K. Antares is located approximately 577 light years from Earth. It is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after Sirius, Canopus, and Alpha Centauri. Antares is one of the largest stars that is visible to the naked eye. It is often mistaken for Mars, as the two appear to be of similar brightness and color, and they are both visible in the night sky at the same time. Antares is a member of the quartet of bright stars that make up the \"Scorpion's Tail\", along with Rho Leonids, Mu Leonids, and Zeta Leonids. The three other bright stars that make up the \"Scorpion's Head\" are prominent in the night sky as well.

During the 1990s, the company operated as many as 90 train shows every year in 40 different states.\n\nCorporate history\nThe Great American Train Show, or GATS, was founded by David K. Swanson as an outgrowth of a monthly train show in Wheaton, Illinois, near Chicago that was itself an outgrowth of a local model railroad club.  Beginning in 1982, Swanson began running train shows in cities outside the Chicago area, eventually expanding the operation to the west coast by the mid-1980s and to the east coast by the mid-1990s.\n\nGATS was originally run as a subsidiary of the NIART company, but following incorporation as GATS Limited became itself a parent to a series of subsidiaries which existed at one point or another.  These included:\n Great Midwest Train Show\n Great Western Train Show\n Great American Travel Service\n GA Technology Services\n Computer Renaissance (franchise)\n Computer Central\n\nIn 2001, the company was sold by Swanson to Elmo Geoghegan, a former Bob's Big Boy employee who had worked for GATS as a show manager.  Geoghegan moved the emphasis of the company from train shows towards computer shows, a change which proved financially disastrous.  In 2004, the company's name was changed to Great Western & Atlantic Train Show, and in April 2006 the company ceased all operations.\n\nOperations\n\nThe core business of GATS consisted of running consumer shows focused on model railroading.  These train shows consisted of several dozen vendors selling a variety of model railroad related merchandise, as well as several operating model train layouts.  Shows were opened to the public over the course of two days, Saturday and Sunday.  Public attendance could range from around 1,500 to as many as 10,000 attendees over the course of the two-day show.  As show promoter, GATS performed facility and show operation personnel contracting, exhibitor registration, floor plan design, and on-site management functions, as well as conducting advertising and public relations campaigns to draw attendees.\n\nSuccessor Train Shows\nAfter selling GATS, Swanson went on to purchase Greenberg Shows, an east coast train show company that had formerly been in competition with GATS.  This operation was later folded into the Great Train Expo company, which was created by Swanson when GATS went defunct.

Sailing with the fleet for maneuvers in the Caribbean, she departed Norfolk on 19 April 1946, returning to New York City on 7 May. On 4 June Macon arrived at Norfolk for duty as a test ship for the operational development force.\n\nOver the next four years the cruiser periodically received experimental equipment in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, conducted tests of the new equipment while she served as an anti-aircraft gunnery schoolship, and training naval reservists off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. She also participated in a midshipmen summer cruise to Europe in 1948. Her experimental duties continued until 12 April 1950 when she decommissioned and went into reserve at Philadelphia.\n\n1950 – 1961 \n\nWith the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Macon was ordered reactivated.  As she had just entered into a decommissioned status in April (3 months earlier) her reactivation went extremely quickly, and in reality consisted of minor repairs, loading a crew, stores, and ammunition.  She recommissioned at Philadelphia 16 October 1950, Capt. Victor Dismukes Long in command and, upon completion of refresher training, became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6 in the Atlantic.  She patrolled in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis of 1956; took part in the International Naval Review celebrating the 350th Anniversary of the foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, 12 June 1957; and participated in the NATO exercise operation \"Strikeback\", conducted in the North Sea and Arctic Ocean in September 1957.\n\nBesides these duties, Macon continued to receive experimental equipment for testing throughout the period. Having also received missile equipment during January–March 1956, she launched the first Regulus missile from an Atlantic Fleet cruiser on 8 May while anchored off the North Carolina coast, and then continued tests of the missile as she completed her cycle of Atlantic Fleet operations. On the night of 19–20 January 1959, Macon, steaming from Cartagena to Marseille, diverted from her course and sped to the aid of burning Italian merchant ship Maria Amata.

By the end of 1959 Macon had conducted six midshipmen summer cruises and had spent the fall and winter season of almost every year with the 6th Fleet.\n\nThe following January, Macon, carrying the U.S. Navy Band, departed Norfolk for a goodwill cruise to South American ports. While on this tour, 19 members of the band perished in a plane crash en route to perform at a state dinner for Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Gabriele Münter\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Gabriele Münter (19 February 1877 – 19 May 1962) was a German expressionist painter who was at the forefront of the Munich avant-garde in the early 20th century. She studied and lived with the painter Wassily Kandinsky and was a founding member of the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter.\n\nEarly life\nMünter was born to upper middle-class parents in Berlin on 19 February 1877. Her family supported her desires to become an artist. Her father died in 1886. She began to draw as a child. As she was growing up, she had a private tutor. In 1897, at the age of twenty, Münter received artistic training in the Düsseldorf studio of artist Ernst Bosch and later at the Damenschule (Women's School) with artist Willy Spatz.\n\nBy the time she was 21 years old, both of her parents had died and she was living at home with no occupation. In 1898, she decided to take a trip to America with her sister to visit extended family. They stayed in America for more than two years, mainly in the states of Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri; six sketchbooks survive from Münter's period in America, depicting images of people, plants and landscapes. Both girls had inherited a large amount of money, allowing them to live freely and independently. Her childhood and early adulthood greatly impacted her future artistic career. She had a free and unrestricted life that was unconstrained by convention. Münter studied woodcut techniques, sculpture, painting, and printmaking.\n\nIn 1901, she attended the beginners' classes of Maximilian Dasio at the Damenakademie (Women's Academy) of the Münchener Künstlerinnenverein (Munich Women Artists's Association). Münter then studied at the Phalanx School in Munich, an avant-garde institution founded by Russian artist, Wassily Kandinsky. At the Phalanx School, Münter attended sculpture courses taught by Wilhelm Hüsgen. Münter studied outside the official art academies in Munich and Düsseldorf, as these were closed to women.  At the Phalanx School, Münter was introduced to Post-Impressionism and the marking techniques of a palette knife and a brush. Her vivid colors and bold outlines were somewhat derived from Gauguin and the Fauves whom she admired. Along with this, Münter was inspired by Bavarian folk art, particularly the technique of reverse-glass painting (Hinterglasmalerei in German).\n\nSoon after she began taking classes, Münter became professionally involved with Kandinsky. This eventually turned into a personal relationship that lasted for over a decade. Kandinsky was the first teacher that had actually taken Münter's painting abilities seriously. In the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited Münter to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps, and she accepted.\n\nWork \n\nMünter was heavily focused on German Expressionism, and she worked in various mediums, including a significant output in wood- and linocuts. She kept a journal and documented her journeys with a state-of-the-art camera. She was familiar with many of the more famous artists of the time; in one of her journals, she stated that she wanted to learn from the avant-garde artists in France.\n\nMünter was part of a small subgroup of artists active in transforming late Impressionist, Neo-Impressionist, and Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau) painting into the more radical, non-naturalistic art now identified as Expressionism. Early on, Münter developed a great interest in landscapes. Münter's landscape paintings employ a radical Jugendstil simplicity and suggestive symbolism with softly muted colors, collapsed pictorial space and flattened forms. She enjoyed exploring the world of children; using colorful prints of children and toys, Münter shows precision and simplicity of form in her rejection of symbolic content.\n\nBy 1908, her work began to change. Strongly influenced by Matisse and Fauvism, Gauguin, and van Gogh, Münter's work became more representative and she took refuge in the small Bavarian market town of Murnau, a village untouched by industrialization, progress, and technology. Münter bought a house in Murnau and spent much of her life there. It was here, in Münter's landscape paintings, that she emphasized nature, imaginative landscapes and an opposition to German modernism. Münter's landscapes are unusual in their use of blues, greens, yellows, and pinks; and color plays a large role in Münter's early works. Color is used to evoke feelings: picturesque, inviting, imaginative, and rich in fantasy. In Münter's landscapes, she presents the village and countryside as manifestations of human life; there is a constant interaction and coexistence with nature.\n\nMünter and Kandinsky's relationship affected Kandinsky's work. He began to adopt Münter's use of saturated colors and abstract expressionist style. Münter and Kandinsky traveled through Europe including the Netherlands, Italy, and France, as well as North Africa. It was during this time that they met Rousseau and Matisse. Münter and Kandinsky helped establish the Munich-based avant-garde group called the New Artists’ Association (Neue Künstlervereinigung). She contributed to a number of the most significant avant-garde exhibitions in Germany up till World War I.\n\nIn 1911 Münter was one of the first artists to exhibit with Kandinsky's German Expressionist group known as Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). Within the group, artistic approaches and aims varied amongst artists; however, they shared a common desire to express spiritual truths through art. They championed modern art, the connection between visual art and music, the spiritual and symbolic associations of color and a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting in its move toward abstraction.\n\nThere is a transition in Münter's work from copying nature more or less impressionistically to feeling its content, abstracting, and drawing out an extract. There grew an interest in painting the spirit of the modern civilization, its social and political turmoil and its gravitation towards materialism and alienation. Münter noted that pictures are all moments of life: instantaneous visual experiences, generally rapid and spontaneous; her paintings each have their own identity, their own shape, and their own function.\n\nFor Münter, it is the use of color that expresses these ideas. The German Expressionists moved towards primitive art as a model of abstraction or non-representational, non-academic, non-bourgeois art. The German artist looked not for harmony of outward appearance, but for the mystery hidden behind the external form. He (or she) was interested in the soul of things, wanting to lay it bare.\n\nLater years\n\nWhen World War I began, Münter and Kandinsky relocated to Switzerland. In 1914, Kandinsky returned to Russia without her, and his marriage in 1917 to Nina Andreevskaya marked the end of Münter and Kandinsky's relationship. Subsequently, there was a period of inactivity in her art career. She returned a number of paintings and drawings to Kandinsky, and stored other pieces in a warehouse for many years. She resumed painting in the late 1920s after she had moved back to Germany with Johannes Eichner after the war.\n\nIn the 1930s, as tension started to grip Europe, and modernist movements were condemned in Germany by the Nazi government, she had all of the art work done by her, Kandinsky, and the other members of the Blaue Reiter transported to her house, where she hid them. In spite of her financial problems, she preserved them with care during World War II. Through several house searches, the pieces were never found.\n\nOn her eightieth birthday, Münter gave her entire collection, which consisted of more than 80 oil paintings and 330 drawings, to the Städtische Galerie in the Lenbachhaus in Munich. In 1956, Münter received a few awards such as the Culture Prize from the City of Munich. Münter's work was exhibited in the 1960s in the US for the first time and was shown at Mannheim Kunsthalle in 1961. When she was with Johannes Eichner, she still continued to represent the movement.\n\nThe Gabrielle Münter and Johannes Eichner foundation was established and has become a valuable research center for Münter's art, as well as the art that was done by the Blaue Reiter group. Münter lived the rest of her life in Murnau, traveling back and forth to Munich. She died at home in Murnau am Staffelsee on 19 May 1962.\n\nIn 2018, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art of Copenhagen, Denmark, ran an exhibition from May to August with about 130 works by Gabriele Münter, many of which were being shown for the first time, in the artist's first comprehensive retrospective in decades.\n\nStyle \nMünter's style evolved over the course of her career. Her early works from her days at the Phalanx school show an extensive use of the palette knife and a limited color range of yellows, greens and browns. Her subsequent landscapes, many of which were painted in Murnau, employed strong contours around a palette of blue, green, yellow, and pink, often with red for emphasis.  Throughout her career, color continued to play a large role in her work. In the early 1920s, Münter painted portraits with the minimal line and compositional clarity valued in Neue Sachlichkeit circles of the day.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Behr, Shulmith, Movements in Modern Art: Expressionism.

Gabriele Münter was born in Berlin. Her father, August Münter, was a manufacturer and her mother, Luise, was a pianist. She was the fourth of six children. At the age of six, she began taking dancing lessons, and at sixteen she went to the barbershop and began to dance professionally in the evenings. She studied the theory and practice of music at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin from 1894 to 1897, and then from 1897 to 1899 she studied painting at the Damenakademie in Munich. In 1899, Münter met Kandinsky, and they began a relationship that would last until the end of both their lives. She became a central figure in the artists' group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), which was formed in 1911, and also in the Erste Münchner Group (First Munich Group) and the Novembergruppe (November Group). She organized the first exhibition of the Blue Rider in the Munich KammerArtsalon in the spring of 1912, and a second exhibition in the autumn of that year in Berlin. In addition to her own artistic work, she was an important collector and supporter of other artists, in particular the Russian expressionists. She was also a teacher and, in 1940, founded the Gabriele Münter School in Munich. In 1914, Münter and Kandinsky spent a summer together in Murnau, a small village in the Bavarian Alps, where they were able to escape the First World War, which had just broken out. The landscape of the Bavarian countryside inspired both artists, and they produced a large number of works in a variety of styles. In addition to their own paintings, they collected folk art and folk costumes, as well as religious objects, which they used in their teaching. They lived together in a house they called the \"Albrecht Dürer House,\" which they shared with their Russian friend Alexei Jawlensky and, for a time, with the actress and dancer Alexander tyne. After the war, Münter and Kandinsky moved to Munich, where they lived for the rest of their lives. They were married in December 1921. In the late 1920s, they acquired an apartment in the Schwabing district of Munich, where they lived until their deaths. In addition to her work as an artist and collector, Münter was a teacher at the Bauhaus school in Dessau from 1919 to 1923 and at the Folkwanerne in Copenhagen from 1927 to 1931. She also gave lectures on art and aesthetics and organized exhibitions of her own work and that of other artists. In the last years of her life, Münter's health began to deteriorate, and she died in Munich on 17 October 1962. Her work is represented in many major museums and private collections.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1692794}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Tanikaze Kajinosuke\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "was a Japanese sumo wrestler from the Tokugawa era, who is officially recognized as the fourth yokozuna, and the first to be awarded the title of yokozuna within his own lifetime. He achieved great fame and though championships were not awarded in his era, he achieved the mathematical equivalent of 21 tournament championships. He was also the coach of Raiden Tameemon.\n\nEarly career \nTanikaze was born  in Miyagi District, Mutsu Province (now part of Wakabayashi-ku, Sendai). He made his debut in sumo in 1769 when he was 19. With a height of 189 cm and a weight of 169 kg, he was extremely large in comparison with most Japanese men of his era.\n\nIn this period, local men with a large physique but often little to no sumo background were asked to enter sumo tournaments. They would debut as kanban or \"guest\" ōzeki and in most cases their \"careers\" were short-lived. This is how Tanikaze, due to his size, debuted in 1769. He chose to stay active in sumo however, and would eventually be promoted to a true ōzeki outright in March 1781. From October 1777 until February 1786, he lost only one bout. This was to Onogawa in February 1782. He recorded the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts at that time, with 63. This record remained unbroken for about 150 years, until Futabayama in 1938.\n\nYokozuna\nOn November 19, 1789, he became one of the first two sumo wrestlers to be allowed to perform a yokozuna dohyō-iri (a special ring-entrance ceremony for the yokozuna alone, rather than entering as part of a parade of the top ranked wrestlers). Both he and Onogawa were granted a special so-called yokozuna license simultaneously in that year. Officially he is recorded as being the 4th yokozuna in sumo history. However, as the first three (see list of yokozuna), if indeed they existed at all, were awarded the title posthumously, he can be said to be one of the first two real holders of the title.\n\nHe was still an active wrestler when he died at the age of 44 of influenza. He was on another winning streak of 35 bouts at the time of his death. In the top makuuchi division, Tanikaze won 258 bouts and lost only 14 bouts, achieving a winning percentage of 94.9.\n\nTanikaze was a very popular rikishi. Unlike other wrestlers of his day, many nishikie (woodblock print based) portraits and images of him participating in bouts still remain.\n\nFamily\nHe had a younger brother, Dategaseki Moriemon (1756-1807), who was also a sumo wrestler and reached the top division himself in 1791. They were the second pair of brothers in sumo history to both reach makuuchi.\n\nTop division record\n\nThe actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied.\nTanikaze's first three tournaments were as a \"guest\" ōzeki, see above.\nTanikaze's record for the Spring 1776 tournament is unknown.\n \n \n    \n    \n  \n \n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n*Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament, and the unofficial championships above are historically conferred.

His work was featured in the notable anthology of Japanese poetry known as the Six Hundred Poets (or, Renga Risshi), and his poems were included in almost all the major poetic collections of the time.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Women in Ghana\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The status of women in Ghana and their roles in Ghanaian society has changed over the past few decades. There has been a slow increase in the political participation of Ghanaian women throughout history. Women are given equal rights under the Constitution of Ghana, yet disparities in education, employment, and health for women remain prevalent. Additionally, women have much less access to resources than men in Ghana do. Ghanaian women in rural and urban areas face slightly different challenges. Throughout Ghana, female-headed households are increasing.\n\nMultiple forms of violence against women still exist in Ghana. In recent years, feminist organizations and women's rights groups have increased. Efforts to bring about gender equality continue to grow in Ghana. The government of Ghana has signed on to numerous international goals and conventions to enhance women's rights in Ghana.\n\nPolitics \nAlthough women are guaranteed political participation rights under the 1992 Ghana Constitution, there is a lack of female representation in government. There has never been a female president in Ghana. In 2012, 19 women occupied seats in Parliament, while 246 men occupied the rest of the seats. In 2017, the number of women elected to Parliament grew, and 37 women were elected. However, Ghanaian women still make up only 13.5% of Parliament. In the courts, the Chief Justice is Sophia Akuffo, the second woman to be appointed to this position. The first woman to be appointed as Chief Justice was Georgina Wood. Additionally, women only make up a small percentage of the total judges in high and Supreme Courts. In 2009, 23% of Supreme Court judges were women.\n\nThere has been a slow increase of women in Parliament since the adoption of the multiparty system in 1992. Ghana has taken multiple steps to increase equality in the political sphere. For example, the government signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination (CEDAW). There are many institutions in Ghana that work to advance women's rights and welfare issues. Women's groups and activists in Ghana are demanding gender policies and programmes to improve the livelihood of women. Additionally, the government has a ministry dedicated to women and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection focuses on policy formation on issues that pertain specifically to women and children. Despite the efforts of NGOs and political parties, female participation in politics in Ghana remains low.\n\nThe lack of political participation from women in Ghana can be attributed to longstanding cultural norms. The traditional belief that women in Ghana should not have responsibilities outside the home contributes to the deficiency of women in politics. Leadership is also a skill that is traditionally associated with boys and men. When women in Ghana take leadership positions, they can face discrimination.\n\nFamily structure\n\nMarriage\nPolygyny refers to marriages in which men are permitted to have more than one wife at the same time. In precolonial times, polygyny was encouraged, especially for wealthy men. Polygamy was traditionally seen as a source of labor for men, as multiple wives allowed for more unpaid labor. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was also a traditional means for fathers to accumulate additional wealth. Today, the percentage of women in polygynous marriages in rural areas (23.9%) is almost double that of women in urban areas (12.4%). The age group with the most women in polygynous marriages is 45–49, followed by the 15–19 age group and the 40–44 group. Rates of polygynous marriages decrease as education level and wealth level increase.\n\nIn traditional societies, marriage under customary law was often arranged or agreed upon by the fathers and other senior kinsmen of the prospective bride and bridegroom. This type of marriage served to link the two families/groups together in social relationships; hence, marriage within the ethnic group and in the immediate locality was encouraged. The age at which marriage was arranged varied among ethnic groups, but men generally married women somewhat younger than they were. Some of the marriages were even arranged by the families long before the girl attained puberty. In these matters, family considerations outweighed personal ones – a situation that further reinforced the subservient position of the wife.\n\nThe alienation of women from the acquisition of wealth, even in conjugal relationships, was strengthened by traditional living arrangements. Among matrilineal groups, such as the Akan, married women continued to reside at their maternal homes. Meals prepared by the wife would be carried to the husband at his maternal house. In polygynous situations, visitation schedules would be arranged. The separate living patterns reinforced the idea that each spouse is subject to the authority of a different household head, and because spouses are always members of different lineages, each is ultimately subject to the authority of the senior men of his or her lineage. The wife, as an outsider in the husband's family, would not inherit any of his property, other than that granted to her by her husband as gifts in token appreciation of years of devotion. The children from this matrilineal marriage would be expected to inherit from their mother's family.\n\nThe Dagomba, on the other hand, inherit from fathers. In these patrilineal societies where the domestic group includes the man, his wife or wives, their children, and perhaps several dependent relatives, the wife was brought into closer proximity to the husband and his paternal family. Her male children also assured her of more direct access to wealth accumulated in the marriage with her husband.\n\nToday, marriage dynamics generally vary between rural and urban areas. Polygyny is more common in rural areas, and a married woman is usually supported by large groups of relatives as well as co-wives. Urban Ghana has generally adopted a more \"Western\" practice of marriage. The urban woman is held more responsible for choosing her own husband as it is not based on lineage or her family's interests. Furthermore, the urban woman is seen as more of a partner than as a minor, as she would be in many rural settings. That being said, it can often be harder for the urban woman to address grievances or leave her husband because of that responsibility and lack of familial support that rural women often have.\n\nGhana’s child protection law, the Children’s Act, prohibits child marriage; nevertheless, data from 2011 shows that 6% of girls nationwide were married before the age of 15. Between 2002 and 2012, 7% of adolescent females (aged 15–19) were currently married. Most of these women live in the Volta, Western, and Northern regions, and generally live in rural areas regardless of region.\n\nFamilial roles\nWomen in premodern Ghanaian society were seen as bearers of children, farmers and retailers of produce. Within the traditional sphere, the childbearing ability of women was explained as the means by which lineage ancestors were allowed to be reborn. Barrenness was, therefore, considered the greatest misfortune. Given the male dominance in traditional society, some economic anthropologists have explained a female's ability to reproduce as the most important means by which women ensured social and economic security for themselves, especially if they bore male children.\n\nRates of female-headed households are on the rise in Ghana. The number of female-headed households who are either widowed or divorced has also risen over time. Contrary to worldwide findings that female poverty is correlated with higher rates of female-headed households, findings from the Ghana Living Standards Survey indicate that female-headed households may not actually experience higher poverty than male-headed households. This is because reasons that households are headed by females differ across the country. Marital status is a significant factor in understanding differences in poverty rates. For example, widows are the group of female-headed households that exhibit the highest rates of poverty. Especially in polygynous cases, not all women live in the same household as their husband. Therefore, female-headed households headed by married women are best-off in terms of poverty, followed by divorced females, and widowed females.\n\nSocial norms and assigned roles for women is one of Ghana’s main issues. There are social standards that women in Africa have to follow, depending on their culture and religion. There are other factors which compound a woman’s social norms. An example of this is, president's wives in Africa are required to be present at official functions, yet preferably sons. Along with there being huge probability of a husband to take another wife if they are not successful to provide a son. A way to fix social norm is by making enrollment higher for women at schools due to higher knowledge of the topic, and higher positioning of women throughout the continent. Being able to change expectations put onto women and rules that cultures have, is difficult due to having to change the mindset of either a culture, a religion or a government.\n\nOverall, women in female-headed households bear more household and market work than do men in male-headed households, mostly because usually the female head of household is the only adult who is of working age or ability. Men are usually able to distribute work with a female spouse in male-headed households, as most men in male-headed households are married. Additionally, the amount of domestic work performed by women when living with or without a spouse does not vary, leading to the conclusion that males generally make little to no significant contribution to domestic work. Further, women who are the heads of household generally own about 12 fewer hectares of land than male heads of household. The disparity in land ownership increases as wealth increases.\n\nFamily size\nIn their Seven Roles of Women: Impact of Education, Migration, and Employment on Ghanaian Mother (International Labour Office, 1987), Christine Oppong and Katherine Abu recorded field interviews in Ghana that confirmed a traditional view of procreation. Citing figures from the Ghana fertility survey of 1983, the authors concluded that about 60 percent of women in the country preferred to have large families of five or more children. The largest number of children per woman was found in the rural areas where the traditional concept of family was strongest. Uneducated urban women also had large families.\n\nOn the average, urbanized, educated, and employed women had fewer children. On the whole, all the interviewed groups saw childbirth as an essential role for women in society, either for the benefits it bestows upon the mother or for the honour it brings to her family. The security that procreation provided was greater in the case of rural and uneducated women. By contrast, the number of children per mother declined for women with post-elementary education and outside employment; with guaranteed incomes and little time at their disposal in their combined roles as mothers and employees, the desire to procreate declined.\n\nEducation\n\nThe transition into the modern world has been slow for women in Ghana. High rates of female fertility in Ghana in the 1980s exhibit, historically, that women's primary role was that of child-bearing. Some parents were reluctant to send their daughters to school because their labour was needed in the home or on the farm. Resistance to female education also stems from the conviction that women would be supported by their husbands. In some circles, there was even the fear that a girl's marriage prospects diminished when she became educated.\n\nWhere girls went to school, most of them did not continue after receiving the basic education certification. Others did not even complete the elementary level of education, despite the Education Act of 1960 which expanded and required elementary school. At numerous workshops organized by the National Council on Women and Development (NCWD) between 1989 and 1990, the alarming drop-out rate among girls at the elementary school level caused great concern.\n\nGiven the drop-out rate among girls, the NCWD called upon the government to find ways to remedy the situation. The disparity between male and female education in Ghana was again reflected in the 1984 national census. Although the ratio of male to female registration in elementary schools was 55 to 45, the percentage of girls at the secondary-school level dropped considerably, and only about 17 percent of them were registered in the nation's universities in 1984. According to United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) figures published in 1991, the percentage of the female population registered at various levels of the nation's educational system in 1989 showed no improvement over those recorded in 1984.\n\nGirls' access to education has shown improvement since then. Even though women have a higher population percentage, education rates are 10 percent higher for men. During 2008–12, the national literacy rate for young women aged 15–24 was 83.2%, only slightly lower than that for males of the same age group (88.3%). However, literacy rates fluctuate across the country and across socioeconomic statuses. By region, literacy rates for girls range from 44% to 81%. Women living at the highest socioeconomic status exhibit the highest literacy rates at 85%, while only 31% of women living in the poorest homes are literate.\n\nInequality in gender enrollment in school remains an issue in Ghana. Economic and cultural norms factor into the decision of whether a son or daughter will attend school if a family cannot afford to send multiple children. There is a remaining cultural belief that women and girls main purpose is reproduction, therefore boys are sent to receive an education as it is believed they will be the breadwinner for the family. A study don by Mahama & Nkegbe found that urban schools in Ghana averaged two boys for every one girl. In both rural and urban areas, boys are preferred over girls for school enrollment.\n\nBased on household populations, about 50% of men and only 29% of women have attained secondary schooling or higher. However, more girls are in school now and are continuing into secondary school. Over the timespan of 2008–2012, 4% more girls were enrolled in preschool than boys. Net enrollment and attendance ratios for primary school were both about the same for boys and girls, net enrollment standing at about 84% and net attendance at about 73%. Enrollment in secondary school for girls was slightly lower than for boys (44.4% vs. 48.1%), but girls' attendance was higher by about the same difference (39.7% vs. 43.6%).\n\nPublic university education in Ghana has been found to be inequitable. Women only \"make up 34.9% of tertiary enrollment,\" and admissions tend to prefer students who come from wealthier backgrounds.\n\nEmployment \n\nDuring pre-modern Ghanaian society, in rural areas of Ghana where non-commercial agricultural production was the main economic activity, women worked the land. Although women made up a large portion of agricultural work, in 1996 it was reported that women only accounted for 26.1% of farm owners or managers. Coastal women also sold fish caught by men. Many of the financial benefits that accrued to these women went into upkeep of the household, while those of the man were reinvested in an enterprise that was often perceived as belonging to his extended family. This traditional division of wealth placed women in positions subordinate to men. The persistence of such values in traditional Ghanaian society may explain some of the resistance to female education in the past.\n\nFor women of little or no education who lived in urban centres, commerce was the most common form of economic activity in the 1980s. At urban market centres throughout the country, women from the rural areas brought their goods to trade. Other women specialized in buying agricultural produce at discounted prices at the rural farms and selling it to retailers in the city. These economic activities were crucial in sustaining the general urban population. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, however, urban market women, especially those who specialized in trading manufactured goods, gained reputations for manipulating market conditions and were accused of exacerbating the country's already difficult economic situation. With the introduction of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983 and the consequent successes reported throughout that decade, these accusations began to subside.\n\nToday, women make up 43.1% of economically active population in Ghana, the majority working in the informal sector and in food crop farming. In crop farming, women the majority of women work in weeding, planting, and selling food crops. About 91% of women in the informal sector experience gender segregation and typically work for low wages. Within the informal sector, women usually work in personal services. There are distinct differences in artisan apprenticeships offered to women and men, as well. Men are offered a much wider range of apprenticeships such as carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, mechanics, painters, repairers of electrical and electronic appliances, upholsters, metal workers, car sprayers, etc. In contrast, most female artisans are only involved in either hairdressing or dressmaking. Women generally experience a disparity in earnings, receiving a daily average of 6,280 cedis compared to 8,560 cedis received by men according to the Ghana Living Standards Survey.\n\nWomen are flourishing in teaching professions. Early 1990s' data showed that about 19 percent of the instructional staff at the nation's three universities in 1990 was female. Of the teaching staff in specialized and diploma-granting institutions, 20 percent was female; elsewhere, corresponding figures were 21 percent at the secondary-school level; 23 percent at the middle-school level, and as high as 42 percent at the primary-school level. Women also dominated the secretarial and nursing professions in Ghana. Although women have been assigned secretarial roles, some women are bridging the gap by learning how to code and take on men's role such as painters, electricians etc. This is changing the discourse on the role of women in the workplace and the nature of their jobs has been evolving with time. When women were employed in the same line of work as men, they were paid equal wages, and were granted maternity leave with pay. However, women in research professions report experiencing more difficulties than men in the same field, which can be linked to restricted professional networks for women because of lingering traditional familial roles.\n\nHealth\n\nReproduction related cases are the cause of many health problems for women in Ghana. According to UNICEF, the mortality rate for girls under five years old in 2012 was 66 per 1,000 girls. This number was lower than that for boys, which was 77 per 1,000. Abortion is the highest contributor to maternal mortality in Ghana. There is a cultural stigma around abortion due to cultural and traditional values. Safe abortion services are not easily accessible for many women in Ghana.\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nCompared to other Sub-Saharan countries, Ghana has a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. However, out of an estimated 240,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in Ghana, about half are women. During the span of 2008–2012, 36.8% of young women aged 15–24 and 34.5% of adolescent girls exhibited comprehensive knowledge about the prevention of HIV/AIDS, which is defined by UNICEF as being able to \"correctly identify the two major ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV (using condoms and limiting sex to one faithful, uninfected partner), who reject the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission, and who know that a healthy-looking person can have HIV.\" Women and girls generally have less knowledge about the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and the Ghana AIDS Commission have helped to create policy to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Studies have also found that religious education is beneficial in HIV prevention and helped reduce stigma in adolescents.\n\nMaternal health\n\nThe birthrate for adolescents (aged 15–19) in Ghana is 60 per 1000 women. The rates between rural and urban areas of the country, however, vary greatly (89 and 33 per 1000 women, respectively). For urban women, 2.3% of women have a child before age 15 and 16.7% of women have a child before the age 18. For rural women, 4% have a child before age 15 and 25% have a child before age 18. There have been organizations that have helped with the issue of maternal health, such as the United Nations and the Accelerated Child Survival Development Program. Both fought against abortions, and reduced about 50 percent of the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nAmong women 15–49 years old, 34.3% are using contraception. Contraception use is positively correlated with education level. Sometimes, women want to either postpone the next birth or stop having children completely, but don’t have access to contraception. According to MICS, this is called unmet need. Prevalence of unmet need is highest for women aged 15–19 (61.6%). Highest rates of met need for contraception are found in the richest women, women with secondary education or higher, and women ages 20–39.\n\nIn 2011, the Government of Ghana announced that it had eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus. This was an achievement on the route to meeting one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters.\n\nPregnant women are more vulnerable to malaria due to depression of the immune system. Malaria may lead to malaria-induced anemia and may also cause low birth weights. Pregnant women in Ghana are encouraged to sleep under a mosquito net to avoid such infections from mosquito bites. Nationally, 33% of pregnant women slept under mosquito nets in 2011, which fell short of the goal of 65% by 2011. More than twice as many pregnant women sleep under mosquito nets in rural areas than in urban areas, and the same is true of uneducated women in comparison to women who had completed secondary education or higher. The correlation between these two rates may be due to more educated women living in urban areas, and more uneducated women living in rural areas. In accordance, the poorest women in Ghana show the highest rates of sleeping under mosquito nets, while the richest show the lowest rates.\n\nAbortion \nA law passed in 1985 allows for legal abortion in Ghana under certain conditions. These conditions include rape, incest, or risk the mental or physical health of the woman. However, unsafe abortion remains prevalent, and abortion remains the highest contributor to maternal mortality. A study done by Sundaram et alt. found that Ghanaian women who seek unsafe abortions tend to be younger and poorer. Cultural stigma surrounding abortion contributes to women and girls seeking unsafe abortions.\n\nHealth insurance\nAmong women in the poorest households, only 57.4% have ever registered with the National Health Insurance Scheme, as compared with 74.2% of women in the richest households in Ghana. Women in urban areas also had higher registration rates than women in rural areas (70.9% and 66.3%, respectively). In order to become a member of NHIS, one must either pay a premium, register for free maternal care, or is exempt as an indigent. Of the women who achieved NHIS membership, 28.6% paid for the premium themselves. The majority of women (59.5%) had their premium paid for by a friend or relative, and only 1.0% had it paid for by their employer. Most women (39.2%) who did not register for NHIS did not do so because the premium was too expensive.\n\nViolence against women \nWomen of all ages, socio-economic statuses, and geographic location in Ghana are affected by different forms of violence against women. There are multiple forms of violence against women present in Ghana, such as domestic violence, rape, and female genital mutilation. Violence against women in Ghana also includes emotional, psychological, and economic violence.\n\nDomestic violence is one of the most common forms of violence against women in Ghana. A study done in 2015, led by the Institute of Development Studies, found that 27.7% of women in Ghana had experienced domestic violence within the last 12 months. Many acts of violence against women in Ghana have gone unreported as there are social stigmas that are associated with these acts. However, the number of cases of violence against women in Ghana has been increasing every year. Media coverage of violence against women often presents cases of violence against women as individual incidents and often blame the event on the victim.\n\nHistorically, Ghanaian women have faced violence from certain cultural practices. For example, Trokosi was a system used by the Ewe tribe, located in the Volta region of Ghana, to repay past crimes. Oftentimes, young girls were given away to priests and would become concubines of that priest. In 1998, a law was passed in Ghana that abolished \"customary or ritual servitude.\"\n\nEfforts have been made by both the government and non-governmental organizations to end acts of violence against women. The Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU), now known as the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVSU), was established in 1998 for the purpose of handling crimes against women and children. In 2001, the government created the Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs (MWCA) to help non-government organizations and the government in their efforts to address issues of violence against women.\n\nDomestic violence \n\nThere are multiple factors that are believed to be influential in the high rates of domestic violence in Ghana. Cultural norms and practices play a large role in attitudes and perceptions of domestic violence. Traditional gender roles in Ghana keep women in the homes to care of the children, while men are expected to be the breadwinners. Spousal abuse is more common when women choose to follow a career outside the home. Education is also linked to domestic violence. Men who have higher education in Ghana generally do not condone physically abusing their wife. A study done in the BMC Public Health journal found that it is \"48% less likely for women to experience domestic violence when husbands had higher than secondary education.\"\n\nThe practice of polygyny in Ghana also contributes to rates of domestic violence. Women who are part of polygynous marriages generally experience higher rates of domestic violence. Additionally, women who are in polygynous marriages are \"more likely to come from households where their mothers experienced domestic violence,\" according to a study done by Ickowitz & Mohanty.\n\nWomen in urban areas face different rates of domestic violence than women in rural areas in Ghana. The risk of women facing domestic violence increases by 35% if residing in urban areas. This could be because \"most of the women in urban areas may reside in slums or poor urban areas and/or may have higher wealth index (economic status) which may increase their risk of domestic violence.\"\n\nThe Ghanaian government has attempted to end domestic violence against women. The Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVSU) is a police unit specifically focused on cases about crimes against women and children. There are currently two special courts that solely hear cases of gender-based violence. In 2007, the Ghanaian Parliament passed the Domestic Violence Act (Act 732). This act condones multiple forms of domestic violence, including sexual, physical, emotional, economic, and physiological violence.\n\nRape \nRape is a major issue in Ghana. It is estimated that 8% of women have been raped and 6% of girls have been raped in Ghana. This is likely a huge underestimate as many women and girls do not report rape due to fears of social stigmatization and shame. Gang rape is also prevalent in Ghana. In 2016, all reported cases of gang rape included a female victim and all male perpetrators. Many women and girls who are victims of gang rape know at least one of the males in the group attacking her. Rape in Ghana is illegal under section 97 of The Criminal Code.\n\nMarital rape \nMarital rape is also a major issue in Ghana. When a woman marries in Ghana, it is a strong cultural belief that they are now under the authority of their husband. Women are often treated as inferior to men. The Criminal Code in Ghana previously had a marriage exception, which stated \"a person may revoke any consent which he has given to the use of force against him, and his consent when so revoked shall have no effect for justifying force save that the consent given by a husband or wife at marriage, for the purposes of the marriage, cannot be revoked until the parties are divorced or separated by a judgement or decree of a competent court.\" In 2007, this marital rape exception was removed from the Criminal Code of Ghana. Despite legislation against marital rape, there remains a social view that the happenings inside the home are private matters that should not be publicly addressed. Therefore, there has been criticism from Ghanaians on prohibiting marital rape.\n\nChild sexual assault \nYoung girls also face sexual assault in Ghana. 78% of child sexual assault victims know their offender. There has been a consistent decrease in child sexual abuse cases since 2002. However, there is a huge issue of underreporting of child sexual assault in Ghana. One of the most common reasons cited for not reporting cases of child sexual assault is the belief that shame will be brought upon the victim and the victim's family. Additionally, there is a lack of confidence in the law and police system. The Children's Act of 1998 was passed in part to confront the issue of child sexual assault. Despite legislative action against child sexual assault, cultural norms and practices allow for perpetrators to face little to no consequences.\n\nFemale genital mutilation \nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is prevalent in Northern Ghana and Ghana's Upper East Region. It is estimated that 4% of women and girls in Ghana have undergone female genital mutilation. Ghana has taken legislative action to end FGM. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) was ratified in 1989, and Ghana declared to be against female circumcision. The Ghanaian Criminal Codes were amended in 1994 to include FGM as an offense. Additionally, FGM is outlawed in the Domestic Violence Act of 2003. Despite these governmental efforts, FGM remains an issue in Ghana.\n\nFGM in Ghana can be performed at multiple points in a girls life. Babies can face FGM at birth if the mother is not circumcised. FGM will be performed on many girls at puberty, as this is seen as a rite of puberty. Additionally, FGM can be performed at death to insure the deceased woman is accepted into the ancestral world. A study done in the Journal of Social Development found that education relates to preference of female circumcision - \"men who are illiterate and those who have been to primary school are more likely to prefer circumcised women than those with secondary and higher education.\"\n\nTrafficking \n\nThe exact number of women and girls involved in human trafficking in Ghana is unknown. Girls and women are often trafficked into the sex trade, either in surrounding African countries or in European countries. Ghana has attempted to address human trafficking issues with the Human Trafficking Act of 2005, however trafficking remains a problem in Ghana.\n\nWitch camps \n\nWitch camps can be found at Bonyasi, Gambaga, Gnani, Kpatinga, Kukuo and Naabuli, all in Northern Ghana. Women have been sent to these witch camps when their families or communities believe they have caused harm to the family. Many women in such camps are widows. It is thought that relatives accused them of witchcraft in order to take control of their husbands' possessions. Many women also are mentally ill, a problem that is not well understood in Ghana. The government has said they intend to close these camps down.\n\nWomen's rights\n\nFeminist efforts\nFeminist organizing has increased in Ghana as women seek to obtain a stronger role in their democratic government. In 2004, a coalition of women created the Women's Manifesto for Ghana, a document that demands economic and political equality as well as reproductive health care and other rights. Within this idea of gender inequality comes other problems such as patrilineal and matrilineal inheritance, equal education, wage gaps, and social norms and assigned roles for women. These are some of the main issues Ghanaian women face.\n\nThe practice of gender mainstreaming has been debated in Ghana. There is ongoing discourse over whether gender issues should be handled at the national level or by sector ministries and where the economic resources for the women's movement in Ghana should come from. Further, critics of gender mainstreaming argue that the system increases bureaucracy and that it has moved funds and energy away from work for women's rights. The women's movement in Ghana has adopted an attitude towards gender mainstreaming that is much aligned with that of the international women's movement, which is best summarized in a 2004 AWID newsletter: \"Mainstreaming [should be] highlighted along with the empowerment of women\" and \"it appears worthwhile to pick up the empowerment of women again and bring it back to the forefront.\"\n\nThe NCWD is fervent in its stance that the social and economic well-being of women, who compose slightly more than half of the nation's population, cannot be taken for granted. The Council sponsored a number of studies on women's work, education, and training, and on family issues that are relevant in the design and execution of policies for the improvement of the condition of women. Among these considerations the NCWD stressed family planning, child care, and female education as paramount.\n\nNotable Ghanaian women\n Ama Ata Aidoo\n Theodosia Okoh\n Yaa Asantewaa\n Farida Bedwei\n Esther Afua Ocloo\n Angela Dwamena-Aboagye\n Alice Annum\n Kate Quartey-Papafio\n Sophia Akuffo\n Yaba Badoe\n Dzodzi Tsikata\n Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang\n Mabel Dove Danquah\n Samira Bawumia\n Hanna Tetteh\n Nana Oye Lithur\n Akua Sena Dansua\n Rose Mensah-Kutin\n Georgina Theodora Wood\n Hannah Kudjoe\n Sally Mugabe\n Takyiwaa Manuh\n Samia Nkrumah\n Joyce Adwoa Akoh Dei\n Abena Durowaa Mensah\n\nReferences\n\n \nFeminism in Ghana\nGhana", "machine_text": " Women in Ghana Ghanaian women have always played significant roles in the country's social, economic, and political development. In recent years, women have increasingly entered into the formal economy, in both urban and rural areas. However, like many other African countries, Ghana still has a long way to go to ensure that women's rights are fully realized. Ghanaian women have traditionally been seen as the backbone of the country's society and economy. In many rural areas, women are responsible for a large portion of the household income, as they are often the primary breadwinners. This is due in part to the fact that many men in rural areas migrate to cities or other countries in search of work, leaving the women behind to care for the family. In recent years, women have been making gains in the formal economy. The number of women-owned businesses has been increasing, and women are also becoming more involved in politics and government. In 2013, Ghana elected its first female president, Joyce Banda, who served a single term. Despite these gains, women in Ghana still face many challenges. One of the biggest issues is the continued inequality between men and women, both socially and economically. Many women still lack basic rights and opportunities, such as access to education, healthcare, and political representation. There are also ongoing concerns about the exploitation of women and girls in Ghana. Many women and girls are subjected to sexual violence, domestic violence, and other forms of abuse. The government has been working to address these issues, but much more needs to be done to ensure that women and girls in Ghana are able to live free from fear and violence. In conclusion, Ghanaian women have played and continue to play important roles in the country's development. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that women's rights are fully realized and that women and girls are able to live free from violence and discrimination.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 15942718}

They count as inspirations such vocal harmony-based bands as Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and The Beatles. \n\nThey recorded their eponymous debut album The Storys in an old converted cinema in the Welsh Valleys and released the album themselves, setting up their own label – Hall Recordings – before signing a record deal with Warners and having their album re-released on Korova in March 2006.\n\nTheir first gig was to over 70,000 people at The Olympic Torch Concert outside Buckingham Palace, and was followed by a support slot with Tom Jones and a series of gigs in venues such as Bush Hall and The Borderline. The band also supported Elton John on two European tours.\n\n2006–early 2008\nTown Beyond The Trees, the band's second album, was released in 2008 on the band's own label, Hall Recordings, after Korova folded in 2007. It was recorded in Spring 2007 at Peter Gabriel's Real World studios near Bath, UK. The album was produced by Jon Kelly (Beautiful South, Kate Bush, Deacon Blue, Paul McCartney). It received favourable reviews from such publications as Maverick Magazine, Uncut Magazine, Classic Rock Magazine, Rock 'n' Reel Magazine etc. \n\nThe band have also supported Santana (Switzerland), Celine Dion (Holland), Sinéad O'Connor (Belgium), Elton John (UK), Runrig (Germany) and Van Morrison (UK) as well as touring the UK in their own right.\n\nEarly 2008–2010\nDai Smith left the band in 2008 and was subsequently replaced by folk singer/songwriter, Rosalie Deighton.\n\nThe Storys' music was featured in the movie The Bank Job, and the band had cameo appearances in the film in the wedding scene. \n\nThe Storys announced they were to split and play one final concert at the Swansea Grand Theatre on 19 June 2010.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\nThe Storys (March 2006), Korova (previously released August 2005, Hall Recordings)\nThe Town Beyond the Trees (March 2008), Hall Recordings - UK #175\n\nSingles and EPs\n\"I Believe in Love\" (2006), Korova\n\"Cinnamon\" (2006), Korova\n\"Be By Your Side\" (2006), Korova\n\"Cinnamon\" (2005), Hall Recordings\n5 Track Promo Sampler (2005), Hall Recordings\nThe Storys EP (2005), Hall Recordings (approx. 100 copies only)\nThe Town Beyond the Trees EP (2005), Hall Recordings (60 copies only, limited edition artwork by Balsamo; 25 other copies had an old photo of Glyncorrwg printed on CD, plain plastic cover)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Storys official website\n The Storys official Myspace\n The Storys biography from BBC Wales\n\nWelsh rock music groups\nMusical groups from Swansea\nBritish country rock musical groups", "machine_text": " The Storys are an English rock band from Kent, England, consisting of Alex Conran (vocals, guitar), mucho (bass, vocals), and Neil \"Cliff\" Cliff (drums, percussion, vocals). Their sound has been described as \"Supercharged, balls-out, rock 'n' roll at its most glorious\" and \"a timeless sound, a la The Who, mixed with the energy of The Kinks, and the driving rhythm of the Rolling Stones\". Formed in 2010, the band released a number of recordings independently, including the extended play (EP) album Make It Good in 2011, and two singles, \"blues bar\" and \"umbrella drinks\", in 2012. They signed with Virgin Records in early 2013, and released their first major-label album, Let It Go, in June 2013. Their second album, Still Here, was released in June 2014. The band's music has been used in the soundtracks for the films The World's End, Payback, and Dead in Tombstone, and the video game Need for Speed Rivals. The band's name is derived from the fact that, when they started, they \"just wanted to tell stories\".", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 7260416}

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Neil Gehrels\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Cornelis A. \"Neil\" Gehrels (October 3, 1952 – February 6, 2017) was an American astrophysicist specializing in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. He was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) from 1995 until his death, and was best known for his work developing the field from early balloon instruments to today's space observatories such as the NASA Swift mission, for which he was the Principal investigator. He was leading the WFIRST (now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope) wide-field infrared telescope forward toward a launch in the mid-2020s. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nGehrels died on February 6, 2017, at the age of 64. On January 10th, 2018, NASA announced that Swift had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, in his honor.\n\nEarly life and education \nGehrels was born in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on October 3, 1952. His father was astronomer Tom Gehrels. He grew up near several telescopes including living at McDonald Observatory before his family settled in Tucson, Arizona, when he was 14, where he attended high school and then the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. He received bachelor's degrees in music and physics from UofA in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1982 from the California Institute of Technology, with advisor Edward C. Stone. He took a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 1981 working with Bonnard J. Teegarden. In 1982, he became permanent at GSFC as an astrophysicist. \n\nIn 1980 while in graduate school, he married fellow graduate student Ellen Williams, who is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and Director of ARPA-E at the Department of Energy. They have two children, Thomas (born 1987) and Emily (born 1990). Gehrels passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 64 on February 6, 2017.\n\nCareer \nGehrels was Chief of the Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center starting in 1995. He was the Principal Investigator for the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission. Other responsibilities include: Project scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), Mission scientist for Mission INTEGRAL, Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Project scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, then known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a professor at the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on transient objects in the universe such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernova and active galaxy flares. He worked to develop gamma-ray astrophysics from a field of experiments detecting a few objects to a full astronomical discipline with thousands of sources in many classes.\n\nHe was elected chair of the Astronomy Section of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He published over 600 academic articles, which have been cited 40,000 times for an h-index of 97. His most cited works include papers on the discovery of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, the Swift satellite, Poisson statistics, observations of gamma-ray bursts at the edge of the visible universe, discovery of a relativistic tidal disruption event, and finding of two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the gamma-ray band.\n\nResearch\n\nOverview \nGehrels was an astrophysicist with broad interests. He worked predominantly in the area of high energy astrophysics, studying explosive objects in the universe such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave transients and tidal disruption events (stars torn apart when they approach too close to a massive black hole). He was also a laboratory physicist developing instrumentation for space observation.\n\nGraduate studies \nGehrels' graduate schooling was at Caltech, working with advisors Rochus Vogt (1976–1979) and Edward C. Stone (1979–1981). The early period was spent performing laboratory and accelerator calibrations of the cosmic ray instrument on Voyager. The later years saw analysis of data from the instrument during the fly-bys of Jupiter (1979 for both Voyager 1 and 2). The elemental abundance of MeV particles in the Jovian magnetosphere was expected to be dominated by hydrogen and helium, so it was a surprise to find oxygen and sulfur dominant. This discovery was found to be related to the Voyager discovery of volcanoes on the moon Io spewing oxygen and sulfur into the magnetosphere. The Gehrels and Stone paper describing the measurement made a prediction, later confirmed, that the auroral emissions on Jupiter are cause by precipitating oxygen and sulfur ions.\n\nBalloon Observations of SN 1987A \nAs a postdoc and then permanent scientist at Goddard, Gehrels worked on the GRIS balloon payload for high resolution (germanium detector) spectroscopy of gamma-ray sources. He first was involved in the proposal to NASA for the instrument, specializing in the design and techniques for background reduction. The payload was nearing completion when Supernova 1987A was discovered. The construction was quickly finished and the instrument flown to observe the gamma-ray line emission from Co-56 decay. The GRIS detection of a broadened and redshift 847 keV line was some of the first strong evidence for mixing and asymmetries in the ejecta, now recognized as signature characteristics of supernova explosions.\n\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory \nGehrels was the Project Scientist for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from its launch in 1991 to de-orbit in 2000. He followed Don Kniffen, who was Project Scientist during the development. The mission was one of the Great Observatories and provided the first comprehensive observations of the gamma-ray sky from 30 keV to 30 GeV. Discoveries include an isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the sky, supporting an extragalactic origin, two classes of GRBs with short and long durations, blazars with bright gamma-ray emission and harder spectra than Seyfert AGN (e.g. Dermer & Gehrels 1995), detailed mapping of gamma-rays from Al-26 decay in the galactic plane mapping regions of nucleosynthesis over the past million years, and detailed mapping of the 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the galaxy with concentration at the galactic center. Gehrels, et al. (Nature, 2000) found a new population of mid-latitude high energy gamma-ray sources.\n\nSwift and Fermi observatories \nGehrels was the Principal investigator of the Swift mission and Deputy Project Scientist for the Fermi observatory. Swift is a three-instrument satellite launched in 2004 and designed to study GRBs and their afterglows. Since approximately 2009, it has become a community tool for observing transient and variable sources of all types including novae, supernova, AGN, magnetars, galactic black hole and neutron stars, tidal disruption events, and comets. Several requests are received per day. Gehrels led the Swift proposal, oversaw the development, and was chief scientist of the operations. Scientifically, he led several papers, including the discovery paper of short GRB afterglow and origin (Gehrels et al. Nature, 2005), and played a significant role in many others. The mission has characterized the afterglow and origin of short GRB for the first time, determine the shape of the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves to great precision and with large statistics (>1000 GRBs), provided a comprehensive data set of UV observation of supernova, and discovered X-ray outbursts from supernova shock breakouts and relativistically beamed tidal disruption events.\n\nFor Fermi, Gehrels worked with lead scientists at Goddard, Stanford, the United States Naval Research Laboratory, and several other institutions to propose the mission and bring it to fruition. He was Chair of the Senior Scientist Advisory Committee of the LAT instrument collaboration. Fermi scans the full sky every 3 hours in the high energy gamma ray band. It has revolutionized our understanding of the high energy gamma-ray sky with observations of pulsars, AGN, GRBs, novae, and diffuse emissions.\n\nWFIRST Era \nGehrels joined the SNAP dark energy mission proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and Michael Levi in 2008. This evolved in the DOE-NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) program, for which Gehrels became the Project scientist and chaired the Science Coordination Group in 2009. He led the proposal of JDEM to the 2010 Decadal Survey. This mission was combined with two other proposals to become the top ranked large mission WFIRST (now known as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). It is a wide-field infrared survey observatory. In 2012, NASA decided to use a donated  Hubble-class telescope for WFIRST and to add a coronagraph instrument to the primary wide-field infrared survey instrument. The mission is in development for launch in the mid-2020s. It will perform observations at Hubble depth and image resolution with 100 times the field of view of Hubble, and will make direct imaging and spectroscopic measurement of exoplanets. The science areas are dark energy/cosmology, exoplanets, and general astrophysics. The mission began Phase A development in 2016. Gehrels was the Project Scientist and chaired the Formulation Science Working Group with co-chairs Jeremy Kasdin and David Spergel.\n\nOther scientific work \nWorking at the conjunction of data analysis and theory, Gehrels wrote several papers of general interest:\n 1986 highly referenced paper on statistical confidence limits for small numbers of events, particularly in astrophysical data\n 1993 paper with Jack Tueller on the gamma-ray emission from the galactic ridge\n 1993 paper with wife Ellen Williams on temperatures of enhanced stability in hot thin plasmas\n 1993 Nature paper with Wan Chen on the Geminga supernova as a cause of the Local Bubble\n 1997 in Il Nuovo Cimento on the use of nu_Fnu spectral energy distributions\n 2003 paper with several co-authors on depletion of the Earth's ozone from nearby supernovae\n 2015 paper with John Cannizzo and several other co-authors on the galaxy observation strategy for follow-up observations of gravitational wave detections with large error regions on the sky\n\nAwards and honors \n 2017, Dan David Prize, astronomy (with Shrinivas Kulkarni and Andrzesj Udalski)\n 2016, Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award\n 2016, Milner Breakthrough Prize for LIGO gravitational wave discovery (Drever, Thorne, Weiss & LIGO Team)\n 2016, Physical Sciences Award, Washington Academy of Science\n 2016, Honorary Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society\n 2015, Asteroid 16000 Neilgehrels named in his honor\n 2012, Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science\n 2012, Alumnus of the Year, Honors College, University of Arizona\n 2012, Harrie Massey Award of COSPAR\n 2011, Member, International Academy of Astronautics\n 2010, Member, National Academy of Sciences\n 2009, George W.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Frédéric Samuel Cordey\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Frédéric Samuel Cordey (1854–1911) was a French landscape painter who was a part of the Impressionist movement. He was a close friend of Auguste Renoir, and had a personal fortune that allowed him to work according to his taste, regardless of the publicity and support provided by art dealers.\n\nLife and work \n\nA student of Isidore Pils and Gustave Boulanger, Cordey was part of a group that revolted against the teachings of his teachers with his friend Pierre Franc Lamy. Cordey quickly abandoned traditional painting to follow the path of the Impressionists and exhibited four paintings Rue à Montmartre (\"Street in Montmartre\"), Le Pont des Saints-Pères (\"Bridge at Saints-Pères\"), le Séchoir (\"The Dryer\", Chantilly), Pêcheur (\"Fisherman\", sketch) with them in 1877.\n\nIn 1881, Gustave Caillebotte informed Camille Pissarro that he wanted Cordey to exhibit with the Impressionists, but that year Cordey was in Algiers with André Lhote. Cordey exhibited his work at the Salon des indépendants in 1884.\n\nCordey was close to Renoir and was one of his most loyal companions. Cordey appeared in several paintings by the master painter, for example, the Bal du moulin de la galette (\"Dance at Le moulin de la Galette\") and La Conversation (\"The Conversation\"). Auguste Renoir's son, Jean, reported a theory of Cordey's which appealed a lot to his father: \"Painters, like gymnasts, must keep in shape. They must keep a clear sight, precise movements, and good legs to go meet the landscape.\"\n\nCordey was a great admirer of the musician François Cabaner. To help him as he was poor and dying, Cordey (like other artists) gave one of his works, to be auctioned and raise funds. Paul Cézanne mentioned the list of the offered works in a letter to his friend Émile Zola. He also admired Nina de Callias and Léon Dierx, whose portraits he drew. Cordey's painting Léon Dierx, prince des poètes (\"Léon Dierx, prince of poets\") was purchased by Georges Viau in 1899.\n\nAttentive to landscapes, he stayed close to Camille Pissarro in Neuville-sur-Oise and Éragny. He participated in the Salon d'automne from its inception in 1903 until 1908.

The airport is managed by the government-owned company \"Aerodromi Republike Srpske\".\n\nHistory\nThe construction of the Banja Luka International Airport began in 1976. In accordance with the development plans, capacities were built defining Banja Luka as an airport of secondary importance, restricted to domestic air traffic on the territory of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nAfter the Bosnian War, Republika Srpska was established with Banja Luka as the de facto capital. That gave Banja Luka Airport new importance and a completely different role. Banja Luka International Airport was opened for civilian air traffic on 18 November 1997.\nFrom 1999 to 2003 the airport served as the main hub of Air Srpska, which was the official flag carrier of Republika Srpska. The company was founded by Jat Airways and Government of Republika Srpska. The company ceased all operations in 2003 after increasing debt, and the withdrawal of Jat Airways from the partnership. There were plans for Sky Srpska, a state-owned airline founded in 2007, to start flights, however, the airline, which never had any aircraft, was closed in 2013.\nThe airport's facilities were greatly improved in 2002 and 2003, ahead of the visit by Pope John Paul II to Banja Luka in June 2003.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, to celebrate the abolition of visa requirements for Bosnian citizens traveling to the Schengen Area countries, a symbolic charter flight was organised from Banja Luka to Brussels. In 2011, Banja Luka airport handled 8,367 passengers, a rise of 74% compared to 2010.\nOver the years, the airport has had flights connecting Banja Luka to Athens, Belgrade, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Ljubljana, Salzburg, Tivat, and Vienna, partly thanks to Air Srpska which was an airline based at the airport. Austrian Airlines and Montenegro Airlines served Banja Luka during the late 1990s and early 2000s from their respective bases in Vienna and Tivat. Since Air Srpska stopped operations, the Government of Republika Srpska has tried to attract new airlines to fly to Banja Luka through various subsidies. Subsidised flights included Jat Airways flights to Belgrade between November 2007 and December 2009, operated with ATR 72, Austrojet flights to Salzburg and Tivat between July and December 2008, operated 3 times a week with Dash 8-100, and Adria Airways flights to Ljubljana between July 2010 and November 2011, operated 4 times a week with CRJ 200.\nB&H Airlines operated flights to Zürich for many years until airline went out of business in June 2015. BH Airlines operated seasonal charter flights to Tivat in Montenegro.\n\nPassenger numbers more than doubled in 2014, as Air Serbia restarted flights to Belgrade, but suffered in 2015 due to BH Airlines' bankruptcy and the suspension of the Zurich route. Banja Luka airport owner Government of RS subsidises Air Serbia flights to Belgrade. In April 2018, Ryanair announced that it would start its first ever flight from Banja Luka (and Bosnia as a whole) with twice-weekly services to each of Brussels Charleroi and Memmingen, while in May, it added Stockholm Skavsta and, in December, Berlin-Schönefeld to its list of new routes. The flights began in October 2018. Overall, the airline expects 100,000 passengers in 2019. In April 2021, Wizz Air announced its arrival and launch of five routes from Banja Luka to Dortmund, Basel/Mulhouse, Eindhoven, Malmö and Stockholm Skavsta.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nThe following airlines operate regular flights to and from Banja Luka:\n\nStatistics\n\nGround transportation\nThe airport was built in the area of Laktaši and Gradiška municipalities, in a wide valley of the Vrbas expanding into Lijevče.

It is located in the city's largest suburb, Cazin, and is 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the city centre. The airport is surrounded by forests, meadows and agricultural land. The airport was built in the early 1940s as a military airport for the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. It was used by the German Air Force during World War II and by the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia. The facility was abandoned after the war and the runway was used as a racetrack. In 1964, the runway was paved and the airport was reopened for civilian traffic. In 1973, the airport was equipped with a VOR/DME navigation system. The current runway length is 650 m (2,133 ft) and the width is 45 m (148 ft). The only navigation aid is a non-directional beacon. The airport is used for the transport of goods and passengers and for sport and tourist purposes. It is the main base of the Republika Srpska Air Force. It is also used by the Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro, the Ukrainian Air Force, and other air forces. A new passenger terminal is planned. It will be located northwest of the current runway and will have a capacity of 300,000 passengers per year. The new runway will be located 2.5 km (1.6 mi) west of the current runway and will have a length of 2,600 m (8,500 ft) and a width of 60 m (200 ft). The airport will cover an area of 250 hectares (620 acres). The new terminal and runway are expected to be completed by 2017 at an estimated cost of 200 million euros. In 2007, the airport handled 130,000 passengers and 2,100 tons of goods. The airport recorded the highest number of passengers in its history in 2008, with 204,000 passengers served. The number of passengers dropped in 2009 due to the global economic crisis, with a total of 169,000 passengers served. The number of passengers handled by the airport in 2010 was 157,000.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2978829}
{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Breit equation\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "The Breit equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Gregory Breit in 1929 based on the Dirac equation, which formally describes two or more massive spin-1/2 particles (electrons, for example) interacting electromagnetically to the first order in perturbation theory. It accounts for magnetic interactions and retardation effects to the order of 1/c2. When other quantum electrodynamic effects are negligible, this equation has been shown to give results in good agreement with experiment.  It was originally derived from the Darwin Lagrangian but later vindicated by the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory and eventually quantum electrodynamics.\n\nIntroduction \nThe Breit equation is not only an approximation in terms of quantum mechanics, but also in terms of relativity theory as it is not completely invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Just as does the Dirac equation, it treats nuclei as point sources of an external field for the particles it describes. For N particles, the Breit equation has the form (rij is the distance between particle i and j):\n\nwhere \nis the Dirac Hamiltonian (see Dirac equation) for particle i at position ri and φ(ri) is the scalar potential at that position; qi is the charge of the particle, thus for electrons qi = −e.\nThe one-electron Dirac Hamiltonians of the particles, along with their instantaneous Coulomb interactions 1/rij, form the Dirac-Coulomb operator. To this, Breit added the operator (now known as the (frequency-independent) Breit operator):\n\nwhere the Dirac matrices for electron i: a(i) = [αx(i), αy(i), αz(i)]. The two terms in the Breit operator account for retardation effects to the first order.\nThe wave function Ψ in the Breit equation is a spinor with 4N elements, since each electron is described by a Dirac bispinor with 4 elements as in the Dirac equation, and the total wave function is the tensor product of these.\n\nBreit Hamiltonians \nThe total Hamiltonian of the Breit equation, sometimes called the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian (HDCB) can be decomposed into the following practical energy operators for electrons in electric and magnetic fields (also called the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian), which have well-defined meanings in the interaction of molecules with magnetic fields (for instance for nuclear magnetic resonance):\n\nin which the consecutive partial operators are:\n  is the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian ( is the stationary mass of particle i).\n  is connected to the dependence of mass on velocity: .\n  is a correction that partly accounts for retardation and can be described as the interaction between the magnetic dipole moments of the particles, which arise from the orbital motion of charges (also called orbit–orbit interaction).\n  is the classical interaction between the orbital magnetic moments (from the orbital motion of charge) and spin magnetic moments (also called spin–orbit interaction).

It is an example of aplanatic equation. The Breit equation is given by Breit equation where the function ω(x) is the Wronskian of two functions f and g that are smooth in the domain Ω, and the function κ(x) is a regular function in Ω. The Wronskian is defined by Wronskian A solution of the Breit equation is given by solution where ω and κ are constants that can be determined from the initial conditions. The general solution can be found by using the method of separation of variables. The Breit equation is a special case of a more general class of integrable partial differential equations called the integrable Schrödinger equations. These equations are integrable analogues of the non-integrable Schrödinger equation, and are related to the Dirac equation by the Kramers–Henkin–Rubin theorem. The Breit equation is also related to the heat equation by the method of characteristics. The Breit equation is important in the theory of partial differential equations, and has many applications in physics, including in the study of quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and general relativity. In particular, the Breit equation is the basis for the mathematical formulation of quantum electrodynamics, and is used to describe the behavior of charged particles in a vacuum. It is also used in the study of the structure of the hydrogen atom, and in the theory of the early universe. In addition, the Breit equation is used in the study of the properties of electromagnetic waves, and in the analysis of the behavior of materials with a high thermal conductivity.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 1989515}

According to the historical writings from Recordación Florida of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán, Tejutla belonged to Quetzaltenango Department and it was a \"prosperous land with rich weathers and comfortable forest with enough water\".\n\nTejutla was an important commercial and religious center; in August 1767, Joseph Domingo Hidalgo described Santiago Tejutla as \"El Curato\" -i.e., the focal center of commerce of all the towns that were around it− in the Gaceta de Guatemala, the official newspaper of the times.  Then, in the last quarter of the 18th century, bishop Dr. Pedro Cortés y Larraz, who arrived from Cuilco in 1770 as part of the inspection he was doing of the Guatemalan dioceses, called Tejutla \"Santiago en la Cima del Monte\" (English: Santiago at the top of the hill\" and reported that there were \"sixty four families who lived very well\" in the area.\n\nThe Central American United Provinces constitution from 11 October 1821, showed Tejutla under modern San Marcos jurisdiction for the very first time.\n\nIn 1870 Tejutla reached \"Villa\" category and, due to its development, its authorities requested to the House of Representatives of Guatemala to be named a Department capital. The department was going to have the municipalities mentioned above, along with the modern municipalities of Cuilco, Santa Bárbara and  San Gaspar, Huehuetenango, from the modern Huehuetenango Department. Besides, in those days, Motocintla, Cacahuatán and Tapachula—which would go definitively to México in 1892 due to the Herrera-Mariscal treaty— were under the jurisdiction of the Mercedarian convent located in Tejutla.  Furthermore, Tejutla even had House representatives of its own in those days.\n\nBut power shifted when the conservatives led by field marshall Vicente Cerna werfe defeated by the liberal forces of generals Miguel Garcia Granados and Justo Rufino Barrios −who was a San Lorenzo native;  once the liberals were in power, the expelled the regular clergy from Guatemala and abolished mandatory tithing for the secular clergy, leaving Tejutla without their main administrative and leadership support, the curato.

It is one of the four municipalities in the Northern Zone of Quintana Roo, along with Cozumel, Solidaridad, and Tulum. The municipal seat is the settlement of the same name, Tacaná. The population of the municipality was 3,635 in the 2005 census and 3,232 in the 2010 census. The name \"Tacaná\" comes from the word \"tacan\" ( Message in Yukatec Maya), which was the name of a village in the northern part of the municipality; and the word \"á\" (place of), which is used as a suffix in Yukatec toponyms to indicate a settlement. Tacaná was an important Maya settlement, which had an important port, known as Xel-Há. The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula began in the 15th century and ended in the 17th century. A period of piracy lasted until the 19th century. The municipality is located in the northern part of the state of Quintana Roo, about 130 km south of Cancun and 6 km north of Playa del Carmen. It is bound on the north by the Caribbean Sea, on the south by Tulum and Solidaridad, on the west by the state of Yucatán, and on the east by Cozumel. Tacaná has a total area of 9,366.84 square kilometers (3,6 square miles). The terrain is composed of a limestone plateau with a maximum altitude of 80 meters (262 feet) above sea level. The highest point is the unnamed hill at 20 meters (65 feet) located at 18° 59' 20\" N 88° 46' 40\" W. The municipality has a hot and humid climate with an average temperature of 27 °C (81 °F). The average temperature of the coldest month, February, is 24 °C (75 °F), while the hottest month, August, has an average temperature of 29 °C (84 °F). The municipality is located on the coast, and therefore has a maritime climate, with an average humidity of 77%, which varies between 70% and 84%. The amount of precipitation is 1,000 mm (39 in) a year, with a rainy season from May through October. The driest month is March, with an average of 30 mm (1.18 in) of precipitation. Tacaná has two types of ecosystems: the coastal ecosystem and the inland ecosystem. The coastal ecosystem includes beaches, dunes, and coral reefs. The inland ecosystem includes forests, savannas, and wetlands. The forests are dominated by low-lying bushes and trees, such as the Caribbean Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), the white cedar (Mespilus ferrea), and the red cedar (Toona ciliata). The coastal dunes are stabilized by grasses, such as the Mexican hairgrass (Piptochaetium dasyanthum) and the Caribbean beach grass (Ammophila brevipaleata). The coral reefs are home to many species of corals, such as the elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), the staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis), and the finger coral (Acropora digitifera). The savannas are dominated by grasses, such as the Mexican hairgrass (Piptochaetium dasyanthum), the red grass (Piptochaetium monopodum), and the Caribbean beach grass (Ammophila brevipaleata). The wetlands are home to many species of plants, such as the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), the white mangrove (Avicenna nitida), the black mangrove (Avicenna schaueriana), and the buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus).

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Julius Fromm\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Julius Fromm (4 March 1883 – 12 May 1945) was a Polish-German entrepreneur, chemist, and one of the inventors of the rubber condom and who also made several other elastomeric products such as rubber gloves and hot water bottles. Owing to his Jewish heritage, his company and personal property was stolen by the Nazis in aryanization when he left Germany for England in 1939. His legacy was not easily reclaimed by his relatives after the war however.\n\nBiography\nFromm was born in Konin, Poland, which was then part of autonomous Congress Poland within the Russian Empire. His parents were both Polish Jews and when Julius was ten years old his family left for Berlin in search of a better life. There, the family made a living by rolling cigarettes as many Eastern European Jews of Berlin did at the time. Julius's parents died young, so he was forced to take care of himself and his six siblings from the age of fifteen. As mechanization gradually replaced manual production, Fromm started attending evening classes in chemistry.\n\nWith World War I, Germany experienced a rapid liberalization of sexual values and sexually transmitted diseases spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of \"skin\": chemically treated intestine or bladder.  Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to vulcanize the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom.  Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped.  Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920, Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.\nThe company also made baby bottle nipples and rubber gloves by dipping formers into a rubber solution.\n\nNazi period\n\nIn 1938, however, under Nazi rule, the government forced Fromm to sell his factories for 116,000 Reichsmark, a fraction of their real value, to Baroness Elisabeth von Epenstein, Hermann Göring's godmother. The process was known as aryanization, and involved selling or auctioning property of Jews at well below market value to German citizens. In return Epenstein gave two castles, Veldenstein and Mauterndorf, to Göring. A year later he emigrated to London, where he died on 12 May 1945. Fromm's estate, which was worth the equivalent of approximately 30 million Euros, had already been auctioned off on 17 May 1943 for 2,255 Reichsmark, though many items including a grand piano, plates, and his library had already been bought or stolen before.\n\nFromms' factory in Köpenick was almost completely destroyed by Allied Air raids, the remaining machinery was shipped to the Soviet Union, as it lay in the Soviet sector of Berlin. The Friedrichshagen factory continued to produce condoms, especially for the Red Army. \nThe factories would have been returned to Fromm's family according to the Potsdam Agreement, however the company was nationalized by the Communist government.\n\nIn East Germany, Fromms condoms were produced by the Volkseigener Betrieb \"Plastina\", the brand was renamed to \"Mondos\".\n\nIn West Germany, Julius Fromm's son Herbert Fromm was forced to pay 174,000 Marks to Otto Metz-Randa for the rights to the name Fromm. Metz-Randa, Elisabeth von Epenstein's lover, had acquired these rights after the death of Göring's godfather, and managed to transform himself from a profiteer of \"Entjudung\" (de-jewification) to a victim of the National Socialist regime. Herbert Fromm licensed a Bremen company to produce Fromms condoms, which—now called Mapa—produces them to the present day.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \"Fromms\" in Das virtuelle Markenmuseum.

Fromm was born in Berlin, the son of a Jewish grain dealer. He initially worked for his father's business, but the family was expropriated after the Nazis came to power in 1933 and their business was Aryanized. He then worked as a broker on the Berlin Stock Exchange, before emigrating to Switzerland in 1937. After a brief period in the Netherlands, he settled in France, where he worked in business and became a collector of art. Fromm became a patron of the arts and collected works by German artists, including approximately 100 works by the painter Max Beckmann, whose work he is credited with having saved from obscurity after the Nazi rise to power; he also acquired works by the German expressionists, including paintings by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Emil Nolde, as well as the Austrian Expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. Fromm was also a collector of the work of French artists, including paintings by Picasso, Matisse, and Braque, as well as the surrealists, including works by Max Ernst, Salvador Dalí, and René Magritte. In the late 1960s, Fromm sold a number of his French works, and in 1978 he sold a large part of his German collection to the German art dealer Georg Karg, who in turn sold it to the German government. The remainder of Fromm's collection was inherited by his daughter, Susanne, and after her death in 1986, it was acquired by the Jewish Museum in New York.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 10022529}

On the first day of the exhibition, the cloth supposedly covering the Green Dragon is removed and everyone is shocked to see that the original painting has been stolen and the copy painting of an art student at the Spencer Institute for Art, Leonora \"Leo\" Fitzgerald is replaced. Leo is present and insists that she didn't do it, as she disposed of her artwork after a rich art benefactor Mr Raymond Lyle criticised it, saying it did not resemble the original painting whatsoever despite its imaginative flair demonstrated in the artwork. Investigation by Detective Inspector Worth is held and he recruits Billy as his assistant in interviews, to which Billy is quite proud of. Sophie, Lil, Billy and Joe decide to investigate further and help Leo to discover the truth. They have perilous encounters, make risky decisions and face many obstacles.

He graduated in the arts from Harvard College in 1866, and qualified in medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in New York City with an M.D. in 1870. He trained further in Europe for 2 years, and started practice in New York in 1873. He became assistant surgeon to the Bellevue Hospital in 1880, and surgeon-in-chief of the Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in 1888. Here he did his most famous work on appendicitis, presenting his report on operative management to the New York Surgical Society in 1889. He described the point of greatest tenderness in appendicitis, which is now known as McBurney's point. He was professor of surgery from 1889 to 1907, and thereafter became emeritus professor of surgery. He continued to advance the treatment of appendicitis, and in 1894 he described the incision that he used; although the incision had previously been described by Louis L. MacArthur, it became known as McBurney's incision. He was awarded an honorary fellowship by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1905 during the college's 400th anniversary celebrations. The honorary fellowship was awarded to the 36 most well known surgeons of the time.\n\nIn addition to his work on appendicitis, McBurney also published papers on the treatment of pyloric stenosis, management of shoulder dislocation with fracture of the humerus, and gallstone disease. He also introduced the use of rubber gloves during his operations to improve aseptic technique, following the lead of William Halsted.\n\nAfter the U.S. President William McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, Dr. McBurney led the medical team that oversaw his recovery after emergency surgery  and announced to the press on September 10 that the President's condition was improving and that he was out of danger.\n\nHe was a keen hunter and fisherman, and died in 1913 on a hunting trip in Massachusetts.\n\nHis grandson was American archaeologist Charles McBurney and his great-grandson is English actor, writer and director Simon McBurney.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Sources\nGuide to the Charles McBurney Papers 1894 at the University of Chicago Special Collections Research Center\n\nAmerican surgeons\n1845 births\n1913 deaths\nPeople from Brookline, Massachusetts\nHarvard College alumni\nColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni", "machine_text": " Charles McBurney (February 20, 1851 – February 6, 1913) was an American surgeon, best known for describing the medical condition that bears his name, McBurney's point.

{"prompt": "Write a Wikipedia article with the title \"Kim Jong-suk\", the article should at least have 250 words", "human_text": "Kim Jong-suk (; 24 December 1917  – 22 September 1949) was a Korean anti-Japanese guerrilla, a Communist activist, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung's first wife, former leader Kim Jong-il's mother, and current leader Kim Jong-un's grandmother.\n\nBiography\nKim Jong-suk was born on 24 December 1917 in Hoeryong County, North Hamgyong Province, Japanese Korea. Suh Dae-sook writes that she was \"the elder of two daughters of a poor farmer.\" However, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), states that she had a younger brother, Kim Ki-song(김기송), who was born 9 February 1921.\n\nKim Jong-suk followed her mother to Manchuria to look for her father, but they discovered that he had already died there. Soon after that, her mother died and she became an orphan. Most sources agree that Kim Jong-suk then joined Kim Il-sung’s guerrilla force in 1935 or 1936 as a kitchen helper.  The KCNA, however, reports that Kim Jong-suk and Kim Ki-song joined the guerrilla forces after their mother and their elder brother’s wife were murdered by the Japanese.\n\nDuring this time, Kim Jong-suk worked various odd jobs, was arrested by the Japanese in 1937 in an undercover attempt to secure food and supplies. After her release, she rejoined the guerrillas, where she cooked, sewed, and washed.\n\nIt was around this time that Kim Jong-suk reportedly saved Kim Il-sung’s life. Baik Bong relates the story in Kim Il-sung's official biography:\n\nKim Jong-suk married Kim Il Sung in the Soviet Union, most likely in 1941. On 16 February 1941 (or 1942, sources vary), in the Soviet village of Vyatskoye, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Jong-il, who was given the Russian name \"Yuri Irsenovich Kim,\" and the nickname \"Yura.\" In 1944, Kim Jong-suk had Kim Man-il, in Korean and \"Alexander\" or \"Shura\" in Russian. In 1946, she gave birth to a daughter, Kim Kyŏng-hŭi. Augustina Vardugina, a woman from Vyatskoye, was in her teens when Kim Il-sung's guerrilla group camped there. She remembers Kim Jong-suk, and how she would come to the village to barter military rations for chicken and eggs. Her son, Kim Jong-il, would be holding her hand.\n\nA year after the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and until her death, Kim Jong-suk was the first lady of North Korea. According to some accounts, Kim Jong-suk \"was a small, quiet woman, not particularly well educated, but friendly and life-loving.\" Major General N.G. Lebedev, an executive Soviet officer during the Soviet occupation of North Korea, recalled Kim Jong-suk as \"a vivacious and generous lady who always cooked enormous amounts of food for the hungry Soviet generals when they visited Kim’s home.\"\n\nDeath\n\nKim Jong-suk died in Pyongyang in 1949. The official story is that she died from \"the hardships she had endured during the years as a guerrilla fighter.\" The unofficial story is that she died in childbirth while delivering a stillborn child. Her death, however, is omitted from her official biography. Some say she died from tuberculosis, and there are other stories that she was shot and bled to death.\n\nLegacy\nAfter Kim Jong-il succeeded Kim Il Sung, he began to make his mother, Kim Jong-suk, into \"a revolutionary immortal.\" This campaign created \"a holy trinity known as the ‘Three Generals.’\" Instead of touting Kim Jong-suk as the quiet woman that she was, she became the heroine of the revolution. The website of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) says she was \"a peerless heroine . . . an anti-Japanese heroine . . . a faithful retainer who faithfully carried out General Kim Il Sung’s [Kim Il-sung] will but also a lifeguard who safeguarded the General of every dangerous movement.\"\n\nKim Jong-suk was recorded to have \"conducted on-the-spot guidance sessions\" and was a \"great strategist\". In her home town of Hoeryong, \"a museum, a library, a statue, a square and the house in which she was born\" are \"devoted to the 'Mother of Korea'\". She arranged parachute training and won several shooting competitions. One story says that she would wash Kim Il-sung's socks and dry them in her bosom, or cut her hair and spread it in Kim Il-sung's shoes.\n\nMichael Harrold, in his memoir Comrades and Strangers, relates several stories he heard about Kim Jong-suk while in North Korea. According to him, there is a memorial near Mount Kumgang that marks where Kim Jong-suk stopped \"when she realized she had forgotten to bring the great leader’s lunch, and had turned back to prepare something to eat for when he returned from the mountains.\" Kim Jong-suk is also credited with inspiring Kim Jong-il to build the Ryugyong Hotel. Harrold relates that Kim Jong-suk told a young Kim Jong-il that he \"must build tall buildings for the people, of 30 or even 40 stories,\" and the son replied that he would build housing 100 stories high. This led to the construction of the 105-story Ryugyong Hotel, which is still not opened.\n\nOn 1 June 2015, the Daily NK reported that Kim Jong-suk's wedding ring had gone missing from Pyongyang's Korean Revolution Museum sometime in late May. Items belonging to key figures of the Kim family are of great importance. In 2010, state television aired a show dedicated to the story behind the ring, which was, purportedly, given to her by Kim Il-sung in 1938 for her role in the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement.\n\nMany places in North Korea are named after her, including Kimjongsuk County, Kim Jong-suk Naval Academy, Kim Jong-suk Teacher Training College, Kim Jong-suk Rest Home, and Kim Jong-suk Pyongyang Silk Mill.\n\nIn North Korean News\n\nIn North Korean News The KCNA regularly reports on Kim Jong-suk, either honoring her memory or describing her revolutionary activities. The following are headlines from articles relating to Kim Jong-suk from 2012:\n\nNational Meeting on International Women's Day Held: \"Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese war hero, upheld the original idea and policy of Kim Il Sung and performed distinguished feats in the development of the movement for women's emancipation in Korea.\" (8 March 2012)\nWax Replica of Kim Jong Suk Displayed: \"A hall housing a wax replica of the anti-Japanese war hero, Kim Jong Suk, was opened at the International Friendship Exhibition House in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Tuesday.\" (26 April 2012)\nWax sculpture dedicated to great woman: \"She carried out secret political tasks assigned by Kim Il Sung\" and \"She brought up Kim Jong Il as the Shining Star of Mt.

Kim was born in Manchuria in 1916 as the second son of a wealthy family of the Joseon dynasty. After his father was killed in the Russian Civil War, he was adopted by a local worker's family. He joined the anti-Japanese forces in the 1930s and was given the nickname \"Kim Jong-suk\" by the Soviet Union, meaning \"Kim the Juche expert\". During the Soviet-Japanese War, Kim was appointed as the political commissar of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. After the liberation of Korea, he became a member of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), and was elected to the Supreme People's Assembly. He also served as the vice chairman of the WPK from 1946 until his death. Kim was married to Pak Song-ae, a high-ranking party official and the first deputy chair of the Supreme People's Assembly. They had two sons, Kim Jong-chul and Kim Jong-un, and a daughter, Ko Yong-hui. After his death, Kim was awarded the title of \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" and was given a burial in the Soviet Union. In the early 1950s, Kim's family was divided between the Soviet Union and China. His two elder sons and his wife were sent to China, while his younger brother Kim Yong-ju and his sister Kim Kyong-hui remained in the Soviet Union. After the death of Joseph Stalin, the family was reunited in Russia. Kim was a key figure in the early history of the WPK, and is credited with helping to establish the party's revolutionary credentials. He was a close friend and ally of Kim Il-sung, and played a major role in the party's consolidation of power in the early years of the Kim Il-sung regime.", "model": "cohere-xlarge-nightly", "source": "wikipedia-20220301.en", "source_id": 2782697}
